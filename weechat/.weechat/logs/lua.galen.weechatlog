2018-04-09 21:57:45	~jesse	This is from my command line :)
2018-04-09 21:57:51	&Galen	:D
2018-04-09 21:58:03	~jesse	I was being an idiot for a moment..
2018-04-09 21:58:12	&Galen	now I gotta figure out how to connect to weechat on my phone, then i'll be set lol
2018-04-09 21:58:16	&Galen	I know the feeling xD
2018-04-09 21:58:36	~jesse	xD just ssh into your computer
2018-04-09 21:58:46	&Galen	eh...
2018-04-09 21:59:03	&Galen	I would rather not make my computer publically available, even over ssh xD
2018-04-09 22:00:03	~jesse	good point
2018-04-09 22:02:32	~jesse	I'm trying to get weechat to get rid of heckman hackers.
2018-04-09 22:02:37	~jesse	are you not fine with riot?
2018-04-09 22:02:48	~jesse	i think the phone app is pretty good
2018-04-09 22:03:05	&Galen	yeah, it's not bad
2018-04-09 22:03:15	&Galen	I just like the idea of everything being in one place lo
2018-04-09 22:03:17	&Galen	lol
2018-04-09 22:03:27	&Galen	although I guess after PLM I won't really have any other slack things
2018-04-09 22:03:37	&Galen	esp if we start using this instead of heckman's hackers
2018-04-09 22:08:22	~jesse	sorry about that
2018-04-09 22:08:30	~jesse	I learned the part command...
2018-04-09 22:08:39	&Galen	no problem
2018-04-09 22:08:39	&Galen	xD
2018-04-09 22:09:08	&Galen	what's the diff between leave and part?
2018-04-09 22:09:12	&Galen	or is there one?
2018-04-09 22:10:12	~jesse	i dont think there is a difference. ones just an alias of the other
2018-04-09 22:10:19	&Galen	ah ok
2018-04-09 22:10:31	&Galen	so should we try to get some other people on here?
2018-04-09 22:10:47	~jesse	you can set a parting message. but I dont want people to know I left lol.
2018-04-09 22:10:53	&Galen	ah, nice
2018-04-09 22:16:48	~jesse	and yeah. We can add ppl. I'm gonna try to be a little selective of who I add since I'm not sure yet how much my pi will be able to handle. My guess is it won't really matter
2018-04-09 22:17:07	&Galen	yeah that's fair
2018-04-09 22:17:14	&Galen	I'd be more concerned about media storage
2018-04-09 22:17:44	~jesse	if people post pictures or videos?
2018-04-09 22:17:47	&Galen	yeah
2018-04-09 22:18:09	~jesse	there might be a setting to auto-delete old messages
2018-04-09 22:18:25	&Galen	good point, I guess that'd be in the config file
2018-04-09 22:22:30	~jesse	I like that we can both have our own servers and still connect to eachother.
2018-04-09 22:22:38	&Galen	yeah ik this is super neat xD
2018-04-09 22:22:46	&Galen	plus we could connect to other servers
2018-04-09 22:23:12	~jesse	yeah, but I can't imagine something like this being all that popular
2018-04-09 22:23:25	&Galen	idk the applications for the protocol are pretty great
2018-04-09 22:23:31	&Galen	cause it's decentralized
2018-04-09 22:23:43	&Galen	which in general is a better model than centalization
2018-04-09 22:24:44	~jesse	nahhh... I think the whole internet should reside on one ginormous server. Nothing wrong could possibly happen. 
2018-04-09 22:24:58	&Galen	XD
2018-04-09 22:25:07	&Galen	One server
2018-04-09 22:25:07		No backups
2018-04-09 22:25:07		Let's go
2018-04-09 22:25:54	~jesse	xD
2018-04-09 22:26:45	~jesse	and we can have Windows on a separate partition too! theres no way windows would do anything to harm other partitions on the same hard drive!
2018-04-09 22:27:05	&Galen	Eww
2018-04-10 10:33:04	&Galen	they are becoming more popular, partly people just don't have the capabilities to stream 4k lol
2018-04-10 10:35:10	&Galen	so the invites you sent me yesterday won't go away, because they are for invalid rooms xD
2018-04-10 10:35:14	&Galen	so I can't decline or accept them lol
2018-04-10 10:35:37	~jesse	:( im sorry.
2018-04-10 10:35:46	~jesse	I probably sent 8 of them too
2018-04-10 10:35:47	&Galen	it's all good haha
2018-04-10 10:35:50	&Galen	nah just 2 atm
2018-04-10 10:35:57	~jesse	I would check the web client
2018-04-10 10:36:08	~jesse	i think you can remove them through that
2018-04-10 10:36:09	&Galen	weird thing is they don't show up on my phone
2018-04-10 10:36:14	&Galen	that's what they show up on haha
2018-04-10 10:57:11	~jesse	i think i try too hard on these game logs lol
2018-04-10 10:57:20	&Galen	probably xD
2018-04-10 11:45:46	~jesse	alright. it ended up being around 1200 words lol. I had to refrain myself from trying too hard and blabbing about world mythology xD
2018-04-10 11:45:55	&Galen	lol xD
2018-04-10 11:52:48	~jesse	Do you know if theres any way to integrate twine with version control?
2018-04-10 11:52:58	&Galen	not off the top of my head
2018-04-10 11:53:16	&Galen	but they are all text files so worst case you could export it into a folder and use git with that
2018-04-10 11:54:19	~jesse	I gotcha, I think making everyone able to work on the project was the real bottleneck on the last project.
2018-04-10 11:54:28	&Galen	yeah
2018-04-10 11:54:35	&Galen	we ended up having to not work at the same time
2018-04-10 11:54:54	&Galen	we still used git bc it was convenient but if multiple people tried working at once we'd end up with ridiculous merge conflicts
2018-04-10 12:00:49	~jesse	I made my team members say they are working on it in groupme before they start and say they stopped whenever they stopped
2018-04-10 12:01:04	&Galen	yeah that's pretty much what we did too
2018-04-10 12:01:12	&Galen	worked out alright once we figured it out xD
2018-04-10 12:01:54	~jesse	Stencyl was just so buggy though. it kept making invisible walls in our levels that we had to design our level around.
2018-04-10 12:02:02	&Galen	yeah
2018-04-10 12:02:06	&Galen	it's pretty shit
2018-04-10 12:47:47	~jesse	have you figured out a way in python to not have ModuleNotFoundErrors? I've been trying to add my project directory to my system path, but thats a really hacky way to do it cuz anyone working in python has to change their sys path within every script that calls it.
2018-04-10 12:48:12	&Galen	for the project?
2018-04-10 12:48:21	&Galen	also where is it calling ModuleNotFound?
2018-04-10 12:48:25	~jesse	yup. or any python file
2018-04-10 12:49:01	&Galen	sounds like it's probably not importing things correctly
2018-04-10 12:49:23	~jesse	i'm trying to run something in test/test.py  but it has to import things from src/model/cards.py. 
2018-04-10 12:49:50	&Galen	what does your import statement look like?
2018-04-10 12:52:41	~jesse	import src.model.cards  I'm trying to get away from relative paths though
2018-04-10 12:52:58	&Galen	why
2018-04-10 12:53:54	&Galen	the other thing you could do if you wanted to do stuff with the path is use virtualenv
2018-04-10 12:54:08	&Galen	push it to git, then everyone just source it when they work on the project
2018-04-10 12:54:47	~jesse	because it was giving me other errors and is very frustrating if you're reformating the directory structure
2018-04-10 12:54:53	&Galen	fair enough
2018-04-10 12:57:40	~jesse	Does this not give you problems? Every time I have to add or move a file, I end up scratching my head for an hour or two trying to find out how to fetch things from other directories... and being able to run that program from any directory. 
2018-04-10 12:58:15	&Galen	we've been using a flat directory stucture, which probably isn't best practice but does work well with imports xD
2018-04-10 12:58:31	&Galen	everything is just 'from .package_name import whateverthefuckwewanttouse'
2018-04-10 12:58:52	&Galen	also pretty sure virtualenv would solve your problem with setting a path
2018-04-10 13:00:15	~jesse	I guess it would, but then Menzies would have to run the virtual env in order to run the program. And I don't trust that he can do that.
2018-04-10 13:00:44	&Galen	xD that's fair, but if you put it in the README I imagine it'd be fine
2018-04-10 13:01:03	&Galen	plus if you use any external packages it would actually make it easier on the graders since you wouldn't need to pip them separately
2018-04-10 13:02:12	~jesse	yeah I guess that's true.
2018-04-10 13:02:31	&Galen	we have one in ours, although I'm pretty sure I'm the only one that actually uses it
2018-04-10 13:09:59	~jesse	I suddenly love virtual environments noww.. but I'd have to make a readme for setting it up :(
2018-04-10 13:10:09	&Galen	xD
2018-04-10 13:10:21	&Galen	if you push it to git you only need to set it up once
2018-04-10 13:10:29	&Galen	after that all you have to do is source the activate script
2018-04-10 13:11:55	~jesse	well the activate script has some system-specific stuff.
2018-04-10 13:12:22	&Galen	ah, fair enough
2018-04-10 13:12:30	&Galen	should be pretty simple to enumerate tho
2018-04-10 16:37:37	&Galen	hmm, sounds familiar xD
2018-04-10 17:10:48	~jesse	I missed that lol.
2018-04-10 17:12:35	~Jesse	ah. since he brought up lisp, I've been switching to my raspberry pi stuff and my website that isn't working lol.
2018-04-10 17:13:07	&Galen	still not?
2018-04-10 17:13:25	&Galen	hmm yeah broken for me too
2018-04-10 17:13:56	&Galen	you ran that command right?
2018-04-10 17:16:38	~Jesse	i did. forgot the command, but I know I ran it. I'm thinking the issue is in the caddy service file.
2018-04-10 17:16:48	&Galen	ok
2018-04-10 17:16:57	&Galen	could be, try stopping the server and running it by hand
2018-04-10 17:17:18	&Galen	probably need to run it as root tho otherwise it won't have access to the files
2018-04-10 20:50:45	~Jesse	hey I'm lookin at game design now and I think I described negative reinforcement badly to you. I think what I had said was that it is a removal of positive stimulus, but it is actually removal of negative stimulus. (aka you put on sunscreen to remove the possibility of getting sun burned)
2018-04-10 20:52:52	&Galen	ah ok, so the negative part describes the removal
2018-04-10 20:56:27	~Jesse	removal of negative stimulus... so it's a good thing.
2018-04-10 20:56:43	&Galen	kinda weird lol
2018-04-10 20:56:49	&Galen	but I guess it makes sense
2018-04-10 20:57:05	~Jesse	removal of positive stimulus isn't actually any term. but giving a negative stimulus is a punishment
2018-04-10 20:57:13	&Galen	ah ok
2018-04-10 20:57:16	&Galen	that makes sense
2018-04-10 20:57:24	&Galen	I should probably study some more lol
2018-04-10 20:57:43	~Jesse	eh.. not really, I tried to study some more and didn't get anything out of it
2018-04-10 20:57:49	&Galen	lol xD
2018-04-10 20:58:32	&Galen	I'm thinking maybe look at some of the terms / guest lecturers
2018-04-10 21:01:12	~Jesse	yeah maybe I should too. at least for the guest lectures. 
2018-04-10 21:01:46	&Galen	I'm not really worried about any of it but I'll probably miss some stupid stuff from those or something
2018-04-10 21:07:47	~Jesse	yeahh I didn't get anything by going over the guest lecture. I'm gonna either do work or play with my pi lol
2018-04-10 21:09:02	&Galen	there's only one correct choice there :)
2018-04-10 21:11:06	~Jesse	money to get more pi's to play with ... or play with pi....
2018-04-10 21:11:21	&Galen	oh that kind of work xD
2018-04-10 21:11:30	&Galen	hmm...money to buy a server more like :)
2018-04-10 21:12:09	~Jesse	if you just had a laptop, and you had money to drop on either a server or a desktop, which would ya go for.
2018-04-10 21:12:13	~Jesse	?
2018-04-10 21:12:25	&Galen	depends what you need it for I'd say
2018-04-10 21:12:38	&Galen	if you wanted to play more games def a desktop
2018-04-10 21:13:01	&Galen	if you didn't a server wouldn't be bad since if you needed more processing power than your laptop you could always spin up a vm and do it on the server
2018-04-10 21:13:15	&Galen	alternatively, if you didn't mind running both games and services on the desktop you could just run both
2018-04-10 21:13:39	&Galen	but the problem with that is you probably want windows for games, and you couldn't really run windows and linux at the same time with good results
2018-04-10 21:15:32	~Jesse	I've already determined that I don't want windows (unless I soley wanted something to game on and do nothing else).
2018-04-10 21:16:10	&Galen	yeah that's fair
2018-04-10 21:16:32	&Galen	you can get secondhand enterprise servers for pretty cheap tho, if you don't mind a little bit o noise
2018-04-10 21:16:43	&Galen	so you could maybe get both a server and a desktop
2018-04-10 21:17:18	~Jesse	and I've got a ps4 so it's not that big a deal if I can't game on it.
2018-04-10 21:17:24	&Galen	oh yeah good point
2018-04-10 21:21:35	~Jesse	I think I'd prefer to have a desktop, and just run services on it if I wanted anything. sides, the only thing that can't be run on my raspberry pi is gitlab lol
2018-04-10 21:21:57	&Galen	that's fair lol
2018-04-10 21:22:13	&Galen	plus you wouldn't need a crazy gpu if you weren't gaming
2018-04-10 21:22:37	~Jesse	I'd have to spend the price of a full computer if I want a gpu lol
2018-04-10 21:22:52	&Galen	yeah tru exD
2018-04-10 21:23:17	&Galen	plus if you wanted to game you could always get a gpu later on
2018-04-10 21:25:28	~Jesse	yeah. I'd also kinda like to not have to plug in my laptop to my tv every time i get back from lectures lol
2018-04-10 21:26:35	~Jesse	so do you have any other ideas why my website isn't showing up?
2018-04-10 21:27:53	&Galen	oh right forgot about that
2018-04-10 21:27:54	&Galen	hmm
2018-04-10 21:29:13	&Galen	you might try stopping the service, running it manually and see if any errors are printed
2018-04-10 21:29:19	~Jesse	I keep thinking its something wrong with the caddy file, and how we aren't specifying port 80 or something.
2018-04-10 21:29:25	&Galen	or if there's anything when you do systemctl status caddy
2018-04-10 21:30:18	~Jesse	no errors running manually but the website still fails
2018-04-10 21:31:04	~Jesse	wait..
2018-04-10 21:32:06	~Jesse	where should root be pointing? should it be to the html directory?
2018-04-10 21:34:39	~Jesse	nah i don't think thats the issue
2018-04-10 21:29:38	&Galen	eh...I don't think that should be an issue, it shouldn't be serving on port 80 anyways
2018-04-10 21:29:43	&Galen	everything should be redirected to 443
2018-04-10 21:30:47	&Galen	and you haven't restarted the computer or anything since you ran that command right?
2018-04-10 21:31:17	&Galen	what's weird is that it still works for me
2018-04-10 21:31:20	&Galen	on my comuter
2018-04-10 21:31:28	&Galen	although I'm thinking it might be cached or something
2018-04-10 21:32:11	&Galen	ok now it breaks
2018-04-10 21:32:37	&Galen	wait nm it's just down lol
2018-04-10 21:41:47	~Jesse	i mightve restarted it 
2018-04-10 21:42:09	~Jesse	check on your computer if its up
2018-04-10 21:42:23	~Jesse	pleaaasssssseeeee :)
2018-04-10 21:42:59	&Galen	loads for me lol
2018-04-10 21:43:15	~Jesse	so for you, it loaded, then failed to load, and then loaded?
2018-04-10 21:43:30	&Galen	yea I think it was failing bc you took the server down tho
2018-04-10 21:43:36	~Jesse	yeah
2018-04-10 21:43:46	&Galen	it doesn't work on my phone tho
2018-04-10 21:44:01	&Galen	on either network
2018-04-10 21:44:12	~Jesse	is your phone connected to something different than your desktop?
2018-04-10 21:44:20	&Galen	same network
2018-04-10 21:44:54	~Jesse	would a cache only be in effect if my server is up?
2018-04-10 21:45:19	&Galen	nah it'll be client side
2018-04-10 21:45:47	&Galen	but I'm guessing my computer is caching it since it doesn't work anywhere else
2018-04-10 21:46:24	~Jesse	yeah thats why im scratchin my head right now. if it was just your local cache, then the website would load fine if the server was taken down right?
2018-04-10 21:47:24	&Galen	in theory yeah
2018-04-10 21:49:30	&Galen	this is really weird
2018-04-10 21:49:38	&Galen	there's also like no info online for some reason
2018-04-10 21:49:49	&Galen	https://caddy.community/t/caddy-service-on-raspberry-pi-3/2567/13
2018-04-10 21:50:07	&Galen	this thing says something about hostname not being set properly but that really doesn't make any sense
2018-04-10 21:53:36	&Galen	ok, you might try uncommenting the lines at the bottom of the file
2018-04-10 21:53:44	&Galen	specifically AmbientCapabilities=CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE
2018-04-10 21:53:46	&Galen	that one
2018-04-10 21:58:19	~Jesse	all of them or just that one
2018-04-10 21:58:38	~Jesse	(out of the group of 3 things)
2018-04-10 21:58:55	&Galen	idk, try just that one and if it doesn't work maybe the others? xD
2018-04-10 22:00:51	~Jesse	neither of them worked
2018-04-10 22:01:44	&Galen	ok how about changing the PrivateDevices thing to false?
2018-04-10 22:02:47	~Jesse	it was already false
2018-04-10 22:02:55	&Galen	rip
2018-04-10 22:03:08	~Jesse	i was lookin at that though since it was mentioning raspberry pis
2018-04-10 22:03:16	&Galen	yeah
2018-04-10 22:03:46	&Galen	what are the permissons on /etc/ssl/caddy?
2018-04-10 22:03:50	&Galen	and the files inside
2018-04-10 22:04:51	~Jesse	drwxr-xr-x   4 www-data root      4096 Apr  9 23:23 caddy
2018-04-10 22:05:23	~Jesse	the files inside are owned by www-data
2018-04-10 22:05:31	&Galen	ok that should be fine I think
2018-04-10 22:06:15	~Jesse	do we know that the caddy file will work with multiple hostnames?
2018-04-10 22:06:28	&Galen	when you tried running it manually before, did you run it as root or pi?
2018-04-10 22:06:41	&Galen	not 100% but it should work, you can try commenting out the matrix stuff if you want
2018-04-10 22:06:58	~Jesse	but then we won't be able to message eachother lol
2018-04-10 22:07:13	~Jesse	and I ran as pi but I did run as root yesterday
2018-04-10 22:07:23	&Galen	ok
2018-04-10 22:09:12	~Jesse	not sure if it matters, but when I ran it as root:
2018-04-10 22:09:13	~Jesse	Activating privacy features... 2018/04/11 02:08:38 [jessesimpsoncodes.com] failed to get certificate: acme: Error 429 - urn:ietf:params:acme:error:rateLimited - Error finalizing order :: too many certificates already issued for exact set of domains: jessesimpsoncodes.com: see https://letsencrypt.org/docs/rate-limits/
2018-04-10 22:09:55	~Jesse	although it doesn't give me that message when I'm pi
2018-04-10 22:10:13	~Jesse	so I guess it's on a user basis... 
2018-04-10 22:08:27	&Galen	this is a dumb question, but have you tried restarting it?
2018-04-10 22:10:28	&Galen	ah rip
2018-04-10 22:10:41	&Galen	nah it's because you've maxed out the number of certificates you can request per week or whatever
2018-04-10 22:11:13	&Galen	ok this is also a bit of a crappy fix, but since your site doesn't actually have anything that needs encrypting, you could run your base website over http isntead of https
2018-04-10 22:11:17	&Galen	and just keep the https for matrix
2018-04-10 22:11:54	~Jesse	i think i tried that
2018-04-10 22:12:19	&Galen	what happened?
2018-04-10 22:13:21	~Jesse	same error
2018-04-10 22:13:37	~Jesse	idk why it's trying to securely connect to an http site.
2018-04-10 22:13:27	&Galen	ok
2018-04-10 22:13:38	&Galen	try changing the url of your website to http://jessesimpsoncodes.com
2018-04-10 22:13:45	&Galen	and change the tls thing from tls [email] to tls off
2018-04-10 22:13:48	&Galen	and rerun
2018-04-10 22:13:57	&Galen	also don't run as root
2018-04-10 22:16:41	~Jesse	the url keeps changing to https
2018-04-10 22:16:51	~Jesse	and then fails
2018-04-10 22:16:52	&Galen	yeah you'll probably need to clear your history / cache
2018-04-10 22:17:10	&Galen	ok I get a 404 on mine
2018-04-10 22:17:17	&Galen	can you send your caddyfile?
2018-04-10 22:23:40	~Jesse	im an idiot lol. i the downloads dir on my computer is different from my pi
2018-04-10 22:24:21	~Jesse	File upload: Caddyfile.txt https://matrix.jessesimpsoncodes.com/_matrix/media/v1/download/matrix.jessesimpsoncodes.com/PLGxIslYwZlPjdyxqQWhFIzu
2018-04-10 22:24:40	&Galen	lol xD
2018-04-10 22:24:44	&Galen	that url lol
2018-04-10 22:25:38	~Jesse	xD
2018-04-10 22:26:57	&Galen	what happens if you add :80 after the url?
2018-04-10 22:27:07	&Galen	http://jessesimpsoncodes.com:80
2018-04-10 22:27:31	~Jesse	it redirects to https:// and fails
2018-04-10 22:27:39	&Galen	I mean add it to the config
2018-04-10 22:28:42	~Jesse	same behavior
2018-04-10 22:28:53	&Galen	works for me
2018-04-10 22:29:01	&Galen	try using incognit
2018-04-10 22:29:04	&Galen	incognito*
2018-04-10 22:30:22	~Jesse	that works
2018-04-10 22:30:39	&Galen	weee
2018-04-10 22:30:55	~Jesse	:) I don't really mind that it doesn't use https
2018-04-10 22:30:57	&Galen	not the best solution but I've no idea why it isn't working otherwise lol
2018-04-10 22:31:04	&Galen	yeah it shouldn't really matter xD
2018-04-10 22:31:10	~Jesse	yeah I was feelin pretty dumb.
2018-04-10 22:31:22	&Galen	you're telling me lol
2018-04-10 22:33:24	~Jesse	yeayy i just set up kodi.jessesimpsoncodes.com
2018-04-11 14:49:25	~Jesse	I figured out why I need to click enter twice in ncmpcpp to play a song. the first time I press it, it adds it to the queue, and the second time changes the song.  idk why it restarts the current song though when i add songs to the queue
2018-04-12 16:47:31	~Jesse	looks like I got at most a 79, at worst 69 on the game design test :(  but I'll get 5 points of extra credit.
2018-04-13 09:34:28	&Galen	Did they already release the scores?
2018-04-13 09:51:02	&Galen	Looks like I'm around a 79 not counting the first two questions
2018-04-13 09:51:12	&Galen	Although there were some answers I disagreed with
2018-04-13 10:51:33	~Jesse	hey galen, I've got a puppy on my lap :D
2018-04-13 10:53:53	&Galen	:D
2018-04-13 10:55:03	~Jesse	they released the review, I just added up my score on my own.  but yeah, 69 without the first 2 questions.
2018-04-13 10:59:00	&Galen	ah, ok that's what I did too
2018-04-13 10:59:08	&Galen	I think I got rather lucky on this test lo
2018-04-13 10:59:18	&Galen	probably shouldn't have gotten as many points as I did
2018-04-13 10:59:49	~Jesse	I feel like I deserved more... specifically 5 points more for the extra credit question that was stolen from me xD
2018-04-13 11:00:24	~Jesse	also, didn't like that they asked about specific games. One of my friends wrote about Mario Kart on the question about Super Mario Bros.
2018-04-13 11:01:27	~Jesse	As if I would know what Galatea is.
2018-04-13 11:06:12	&Galen	Lol yeah
2018-04-13 11:06:30	&Galen	To be fair we were supposed to play Galatea before one of the classes
2018-04-13 11:07:39	~Jesse	But they should be accomodating for students who don't go to class!!!
2018-04-13 11:07:41	~Jesse	xD
2018-04-13 11:07:54	~Jesse	didn't know that
2018-04-13 11:12:14	&Galen	Rip xD
2018-04-13 11:22:14	&Galen	so I figured out how to set up continuous integration on gitlab, and it's super cool xD
2018-04-13 11:22:58	~Jesse	I thought you did that a while ago. Are you now reaping the benefits of it?
2018-04-13 11:23:10	&Galen	yeah I finally got it to work :P
2018-04-13 11:23:17	&Galen	only took me hours of my time lol
2018-04-13 11:23:38	&Galen	the main issue I was having was getting the database stuff to work
2018-04-13 11:23:50	&Galen	bc my tests need things to be in the databases so I was trying to seed them
2018-04-13 11:23:54	~Jesse	nice! I hope it saves you time in the future.
2018-04-13 11:24:12	&Galen	long story short it didn't work so I just end up putting stuff in the database before the test runs lol xD
2018-04-13 11:24:16	&Galen	hopefully yewah
2018-04-13 11:24:24	&Galen	at the very least I have a decent idea of how it works lol
2018-04-13 11:26:34	&Galen	have you checked out gitea yet?
2018-04-13 11:55:50	~Jesse	I have not. I've been busy playing with my parent's new puppy and writing up the proposal for ENG 331
2018-04-13 11:56:09	&Galen	Good reasons not to :)
2018-04-13 11:56:11	~Jesse	how long did you make your proposal?
2018-04-13 11:56:14	&Galen	Well, the puppy at least ;)
2018-04-13 11:56:23	~Jesse	right?
2018-04-13 11:56:28	&Galen	Umm I think it was around 16 pages?
2018-04-13 11:56:35	&Galen	But that was with appendices
2018-04-13 11:57:35	~Jesse	the examples my teacher showed were all around 16 pages... the rubric says around 10 pages, but to be honest, I might just stop around 6 or 7... unless I have enough content to just keep going.
2018-04-13 11:57:55	&Galen	Wait nm mine was 26
2018-04-13 11:58:03	&Galen	But again that was with a fair bit extra
2018-04-13 11:58:07	~Jesse	xD whaaaaaaatttt
2018-04-13 11:58:22	&Galen	You could always just add more random stuff xD or format it to make it longer lol
2018-04-13 11:58:40	&Galen	Mine was longer partly BC I had a lot of lists that were indented lol
2018-04-13 11:58:54	~Jesse	Good choice lol
2018-04-13 12:07:25	~Jesse	even still though. 26 pages is a ton. You mustve really wanted an A.  Personally, I hate writing enough to where I would gladly take a C on this assignment.
2018-04-13 12:09:10	&Galen	Honestly I just kinda kept writing lol
2018-04-13 12:09:43	&Galen	I think everyone got As because she ran out of time to grade stuff lol
2018-04-13 12:12:20	~Jesse	lol We only have 1 assignment graded. (and a few forum posts graded).
2018-04-13 12:13:01	~Jesse	There should be a rule about assignments needing to be graded before finals.
2018-04-13 12:13:21	&Galen	Rip
2018-04-13 12:13:32	&Galen	Pretty sure that means you'll all be getting As xD
2018-04-13 12:14:24	~Jesse	maybe. 
2018-04-14 16:42:41	~Jesse	Galen, I'm ashamed of the piece of crap proposal I have written. xD
2018-04-14 16:43:05	&Galen	xD
2018-04-14 16:43:16	&Galen	at least you're done :D
2018-04-14 16:43:36	~Jesse	Yeah. I should probably read through it once to be sure I'm not a complete imbecile haha
2018-04-14 16:43:48	&Galen	eh
2018-04-14 16:43:53	&Galen	I usually don't xD
2018-04-14 16:44:11	~Jesse	xD I won't change anything, I'll just feel bad about myself.
2018-04-14 16:44:41	&Galen	rip
2018-04-14 16:44:45	&Galen	don't do it then xD
2018-04-14 16:50:09	~Jesse	ya know, rereading through it.. it wasn't that bad. It was like other proposals, I fell asleep in the first sentence and didnt read the rest.
2018-04-14 16:50:16	&Galen	xD
2018-04-14 16:50:19	&Galen	that's how it should be
2018-04-14 16:57:21	&Galen	have you all started on your game design project yet?
2018-04-14 16:57:32	~Jesse	We have a game design project?
2018-04-14 16:57:43	&Galen	xD
2018-04-14 16:57:44	~Jesse	jk. I haven't started. I've been focusing on everything else
2018-04-14 16:57:52	&Galen	k I feel better now lol
2018-04-14 16:58:00	&Galen	I should probably do the game log tho lol
2018-04-14 16:58:28	~Jesse	I've vaguely thought about setting up a google docs that we can copy and paste into twine for version control.
2018-04-14 16:58:35	~Jesse	I have completed the game log tho
2018-04-14 17:01:12	~Jesse	I also need more work to be done on the plm. 
2018-04-14 17:01:24	&Galen	yeah....
2018-04-14 17:01:51	~Jesse	you sound like you haven't started lol
2018-04-14 17:02:19	&Galen	neither of my group members have pushed code in a month :(
2018-04-14 17:03:28	~Jesse	ouch. Sure wish teachers actually looked at the commit history
2018-04-14 17:03:39	~Jesse	or the google docs history.
2018-04-14 17:03:47	&Galen	yep
2018-04-14 17:03:59	&Galen	one of them said he was going to push some ui code on wednesday
2018-04-14 17:04:09	&Galen	it's now saturday and they aren't responding on slack
2018-04-14 17:04:18	&Galen	cause, ya know
2018-04-14 17:04:32	&Galen	projects worth 50% of our grade should always be randomly assigned teams
2018-04-14 17:04:40	&Galen	otherwise things would be too easy
2018-04-14 17:05:59	~Jesse	:(  I feel bad that I haven't contributed much to my project. I've made a ton of changes and changed them back so it looks like I haven't done much. At the same time, I've done more than one other of my group members. 
2018-04-14 17:06:11	&Galen	rip
2018-04-14 17:06:23	&Galen	at least you know you've been contributing even if it doesn't look like that
2018-04-14 17:08:27	~Jesse	yeah, and I don't think my teammates are judging me too much... but I still feel bad.
2018-04-14 17:09:16	&Galen	yeah idk just kinda fuck this class at this point
2018-04-14 17:09:26	&Galen	at least it hasn't been very hard
2018-04-14 17:11:54	~Jesse	Woohoo! i'm done with ENG 331 now!!
2018-04-14 17:12:03	&Galen	:D
2018-04-14 17:12:04	&Galen	congrats
2018-04-14 17:13:20	&Galen	time for server stuff :)
2018-04-14 17:15:32	~Jesse	Thanks. As for Menzies class, I see value in a few of the lectures hes given us.. which is a lot more than I can say about other classes I've taken.. but that being said, it's definitely not enough to warrant the expenses of college.
2018-04-14 17:15:48	&Galen	I guess that's fair
2018-04-14 17:16:00	&Galen	I just liked it a lot better when it was low key and there weren't assignments lol
2018-04-14 17:16:03	~Jesse	And screw server stuff, i'm playing with that puppy tonight :)
2018-04-14 17:16:19	&Galen	:)
2018-04-14 17:19:20	~Jesse	yeah. Honestly, I think projects and homeworks should be done moreso for the sake of curiosity rather than a grade. But it's difficult to write a 30 page proposal when you don't have data to blab about lol.
2018-04-14 17:19:34	&Galen	yeah exactly
2018-04-14 17:20:24	&Galen	idk I would have loved to have some assignments to learn more about lisp or clojure or any of the other things he talkked about
2018-04-14 17:21:01	~Jesse	I wonder how many people would benefit from gradeless class structures though. For sure you and I would, but a lot of students are lazy and uninterested in CS..
2018-04-14 17:21:10	~Jesse	And yeah, I wouldve liked that too
2018-04-14 17:21:55	&Galen	yeah idk
2018-04-14 17:22:12	~Jesse	or maybe if he had assignments on taking code and abstracting elements out of it.
2018-04-14 17:22:19	&Galen	I do think that projects are waaaaaay more valuble than lectures tho
2018-04-14 17:22:27	&Galen	most of the time lectures just don't do anything for me
2018-04-14 17:22:34	~Jesse	agreed.
2018-04-14 17:22:43	~Jesse	lectures are valuable to those who hate CS though.
2018-04-14 17:22:44	&Galen	honestly I think the only lectures that I've really felt were useful and I enjoyed were sturgill's
2018-04-14 17:23:07	~Jesse	yeah, but he went over too much at once I felt... 
2018-04-14 17:23:18	&Galen	That's fair
2018-04-14 17:23:30	&Galen	His classes are probably the best I've taken here tho
2018-04-14 17:23:48	&Galen	I feel like I really learned the material BC of all the daily assignments
2018-04-14 17:23:55	&Galen	Plus his projects were good imo
2018-04-14 17:24:37	~Jesse	By far. I really respect Dr. Kowolenkos class though. lectures were BS, and homeworks/tests were BS, but we had one project in there that was super valuable and it almost makes me proud to talk about.
2018-04-14 17:24:51	&Galen	That's good
2018-04-14 17:25:03	&Galen	I wish I'd taken more classes like that
2018-04-14 17:26:18	~Jesse	to be fair, we only really worked on that project for 3 weeks lol.
2018-04-14 19:30:45	&Galen	pretty much any company that is large enough and has some kind of online software probably pays pretty well
2018-04-14 19:30:59	&Galen	it's a bit like QA, except you don't have to fix it xD
2018-04-14 19:31:21	~Jesse	xD thats  a funny way to look at it.
2018-04-14 19:31:48	&Galen	one of my roommate's brothers does stuff like that for deutschebank I think and he loves it
2018-04-14 19:32:08	&Galen	you jsut essentially get paid to break other people's stuff, without repercussions
2018-04-14 19:33:48	~Jesse	sounds fun. I wonder if it gets old or routine after a while. Im kinda hitting the point now with my research where Im just doing the same thing, writing webscrapers, putting it in a db, and occasionally some django frontend.
2018-04-14 19:34:06	&Galen	idk, that's a good question
2018-04-14 19:34:19	~Jesse	not gonna lie though, sometimes its nice to just be doing the routine rather than doing new things.
2018-04-14 19:34:23	&Galen	I imagine that it stays pretty fluid since the same bugs probably don't come up that often tho
2018-04-14 19:34:30	&Galen	yeah true
2018-04-16 21:07:35	~Jesse	So the Insert key on keyboards triggers vim's insert mode. That's honestly the best use I've seen for that dumb button lol.
2018-04-16 21:17:28	&Galen	XD
2018-04-16 21:17:28		That's actually pretty cool
2018-04-16 21:21:57	~Jesse	Galen, the more I'm being forced to research alternative medicine, the more I think it's all just BS. 
2018-04-16 21:22:30	&Galen	lol xD
2018-04-16 21:22:35	&Galen	alternative medicine as in what
2018-04-16 21:22:54	~Jesse	As in using Kudzu roots to treat alcoholism.
2018-04-16 21:23:11	&Galen	oh
2018-04-16 21:23:14	&Galen	yeah, pretty much
2018-04-16 21:23:28	&Galen	the only 'alternative medicine' that I know works is oil of oregano lo.
2018-04-16 21:23:31	&Galen	lol*
2018-04-16 21:23:37	~Jesse	whats that do?
2018-04-16 21:24:21	&Galen	basically if you are sick it makes you not sick xD
2018-04-16 21:24:54	~Jesse	I've heard peppermint oil is supposed to help with headaches. I have some, and I can say.. it smells good. Cant say for sure whether it helps or not, but I sure do like the smell.
2018-04-16 21:25:01	&Galen	lol xD
2018-04-16 21:25:04	&Galen	seems reasonable
2018-04-16 21:25:57	~Jesse	and yeah thats another thing... most alternative medicines are used to treat everything. Pain, depression, anxiety, 'sickness'. I even read somewhere that vitamin A and D can treat Batten Disease.
2018-04-16 21:27:06	&Galen	yeah
2018-04-16 21:30:17	~Jesse	Itd be a good thing for pain management or symptom treatment though. Just wish they could stay consistent. Also, every time I click a link of an herbal remedies page talking about a 'Database of Herbal Remedies', it's either an html page or a PDF of a table... These aren't databases Galen!!! 
2018-04-16 21:31:41	&Galen	lol xD
2018-04-16 21:31:55	&Galen	people just hear buzzwords and imitate them
2018-04-16 21:32:53	~Jesse	"It would have been too difficult to set up a searchable database" 
2018-04-16 21:33:00	~Jesse	actual quote from the site owner
2018-04-16 21:33:15	~Jesse	DATABASES BY DEFAULT ARE SEARCHABLE!!
2018-04-16 21:33:28	&Galen	lol
2018-04-16 21:33:35	&Galen	'computer science'
2018-04-16 21:43:11	~Jesse	Rant part 2: Another website is selling CD's of what looks to be a Windows XP program with decorative buttons with information on herbs. Once again, they call it a database.
2018-04-16 21:45:19	&Galen	loool
2018-04-16 21:48:16	~Jesse	from that, can we assume that people who use alternative medicines don't have the capacity to 'Google'? or are they still using AOL?
2018-04-16 21:49:13	&Galen	nah I think we can assume that like 90% of the population has no idea how computers work
2018-04-16 21:53:28	~Jesse	That can't be true. cuz more than 90% of people view porn!!
2018-04-16 21:53:44	&Galen	xD
2018-04-16 21:53:57	&Galen	maybe they use their smart tvs
2018-04-16 21:55:39	~Jesse	...you watch too much porn to think of using a smart tv for that.
2018-04-16 21:55:57	&Galen	lol
2018-04-16 21:56:28	&Galen	if it's smart it might as well be porn-capable, otherwise what's the point?
2018-04-16 21:58:44	~Jesse	I guess intelligence is just how much sex-content there is on a system.
2018-04-16 21:59:06	&Galen	makes sense
2018-04-16 22:00:17	~Jesse	crap... I've been doing college wrong all this time...
2018-04-16 22:00:43	&Galen	pretty much everything is about sex if you really get down to it
2018-04-16 22:02:55	~Jesse	But Galen, asexual people exist! does that mean those people don't have a consciousness?
2018-04-16 22:03:08	&Galen	no, it means they don't have souls
2018-04-16 22:03:13	&Galen	much like redheads ;)
2018-04-16 22:03:19	~Jesse	XD
2018-04-17 13:13:48	~Jesse	Hey Galen, do you wanna study for either our Game Design or PLM final? I suddenly have time today, that I can't spend on too many other things.
2018-04-17 15:53:34	&Galen	Hey, sorry, got this late lol
2018-04-17 15:53:58	&Galen	I honestly probably won't start studying for those until finals week xD I have a fair bit of stuff before then
2018-04-17 15:54:06	~Jesse	yeah your name appeared red so I figured your server was down.
2018-04-17 15:55:05	~Jesse	And I gotcha. I've been working on a few other things, but if everything goes well, I should be able to begin studying this weekend. I don't feel ready at all for philosophy, game design, or PLM.
2018-04-17 15:55:40	&Galen	Ah
2018-04-17 15:55:40		Nah it should be up, I was away tho I guess
2018-04-17 15:55:40		Yeah same, I don't tend to study too far in advance most of the time
2018-04-17 15:56:07	&Galen	I'll def be down to study together once it gets closer tho
2018-04-17 15:58:54	~Jesse	cool. from next thursday up until the game design test, I think I'm gonna be in charlotte since I don't have any exams or classes during that period. But if you wanted to study with me during that time for game design, we could message or call.
2018-04-17 15:59:17	&Galen	OK cool, that sounds good to me
2018-04-17 16:37:25	~Jesse	Do you think someone should try to argue this regulation for menzies class? https://grad.ncsu.edu/events/last-week-of-classes-april-24-28/
2018-04-17 16:41:17	~Jesse	that may just be for grad classes, but I thought somewhere they put that regulation in undergrad as well.
2018-04-17 16:42:28	&Galen	Ooh
2018-04-17 16:42:38	&Galen	That would be sweet
2018-04-17 16:42:50	~Jesse	https://studentservices.ncsu.edu/calendars/academic/#terms
2018-04-17 16:43:08	~Jesse	I don't really wanna be the guy to do this... xD
2018-04-17 16:43:29	&Galen	To be fair he extended it because we asked...so I'm not sure if it'd fly
2018-04-17 16:44:00	~Jesse	but even at the old due date it was during the last week of classes.. once again, against the regulation.
2018-04-17 16:45:07	&Galen	I think this whole class is against regulation
2018-04-17 16:45:27	~Jesse	Should I try to email someone? I don't even know who I would email though.
2018-04-17 16:45:39	&Galen	The admins probably
2018-04-17 16:49:28	~Jesse	I still don't know who that would be. If you give me an email address to someone other than the prof, I'll send it. I kinda want it to be semi-anonymous.
2018-04-17 16:49:45	&Galen	Barbara adams maybe
2018-04-17 16:49:59	~Jesse	well crap, I don't really wanna email her either  lol
2018-04-17 16:50:06	&Galen	XD
2018-04-17 16:50:21	&Galen	You could do Dr Marini but I feel like Adams would care more
2018-04-17 17:06:52	&Galen	Tell matt, he'd probably be willing to bring it up
2018-04-17 17:11:32	~Jesse	I made an email for Dr. Adams. I think I'm gonna wait till the end of class to send it.
2018-04-17 17:12:17	&Galen	Yeah
2018-04-17 17:13:00	&Galen	She'll probably ask if you've brought it up with Tim tho
2018-04-17 17:13:29	&Galen	Sorry I mean timm
2018-04-17 17:13:48	~Jesse	In my email, I explained that I was uncomfortable with confronting him.
2018-04-17 17:14:05	&Galen	What should actually happen is that he should drop the essay and keep the extra credit
2018-04-17 17:14:26	~Jesse	wonder if he'll just make the due date friday lol.
2018-04-17 17:14:53	~Jesse	I don't think hes that evil. But Dr. Adams will probably say screw you and do your essay jesse.
2018-04-17 17:15:04	&Galen	BC it's probably reasonable for him to have extra credit due then since it's not required, just not the essay
2018-04-17 17:15:04	&Galen	Ah, nicr
2018-04-17 17:15:41	&Galen	yeah, considering he doesn't listen to what we have to say I doubt it'd be a very productive discussion with him anyways
2018-04-17 17:17:10	~Jesse	right.. but I don't want to tell adams that since I want her to think I have a positive image of my professor.
2018-04-17 17:17:45	~Jesse	I just said i was uncomfortable with confronting him because I didn't want him to see me poorly as a student.
2018-04-17 17:17:47	&Galen	well...if you say you aren't comfortable bringing it up with him I'd say that probably doesn't put him in a very positive light xD
2018-04-17 17:17:52	&Galen	that's fair I guess
2018-04-17 17:18:11	&Galen	could also get someone else to bring it up and when he dismisses it, which he will, jump on that and go to dr adams
2018-04-17 17:18:38	&Galen	that way we have precident for him not responding to us, and he doesn't get to make up a counterargument
2018-04-17 17:19:08	~Jesse	Would you like to volunteer yourself to bring it up to Menzies?
2018-04-17 17:19:47	~Jesse	It sounds like youre volunteering yourself xD
2018-04-17 17:20:06	~Jesse	You can do it mr. ordinary!!!!
2018-04-17 17:20:13	&Galen	Not really, since I probably am already in his bad books from last time :P
2018-04-17 17:20:13		And I think he'd see it as me just trying to get even
2018-04-17 17:20:13		But matt might be willing to bring it up in class or something, esp since Menzies probably still likes him xD
2018-04-17 17:20:16	&Galen	Lol xD
2018-04-17 17:21:01	~Jesse	I like that we're conspiring about manipulating matt xD
2018-04-17 17:21:44	&Galen	XD not so much manipulating, I just know that he doesn't mind confronting people
2018-04-17 17:22:36	&Galen	Plus he's the only other person I know in that class other than you, Grady and josh and I don't think either of them care that much
2018-04-17 17:23:12	~Jesse	Grady is in this class? maybe im thinking of a different grady i know.
2018-04-17 17:23:22	&Galen	Could be
2018-04-17 17:23:26	~Jesse	Dude with a magicians hand tattooed on his arm?
2018-04-17 17:23:33	&Galen	He was in my group in software eng last semester
2018-04-17 17:23:47	&Galen	Mmm don't think so, probably someone else
2018-04-17 17:23:52	~Jesse	oh I know that grady. I was thinking of another grady.
2018-04-17 17:24:23	~Jesse	or maybe I just jacked up the magician guy's name.
2018-04-17 17:24:54	&Galen	XD I don't think I know anyone with a magician tattoo, so idk
2018-04-17 17:26:34	~Jesse	Thats a shame. Hes very similar to Josh in the way that he always seems overly relaxed all the time while still being omniscient.
2018-04-17 17:26:57	&Galen	XD that's a good way to describe josh
2018-04-17 17:31:17	~Jesse	xD yeah. too bad hes in with the NSA
2018-04-17 17:31:36	&Galen	^
2018-04-17 21:01:15	~Jesse	I looked into gitea, but their documentation wasn't good enough for me to get passed a bug I was having that caused the program to not start :P  I'm looking into Huginne now. Maybe I can try to use it to monitor deals on computer parts or something.
2018-04-17 22:56:55	~Jesse	you said you set up docker right? Apparently that makes setting up Huginne a lot easier. 
2018-04-17 22:57:38	&Galen	I have a docker VM running gitlab-runner
2018-04-17 22:57:49	&Galen	other than that I'm not running any services with docker, just lcoal stuff
2018-04-17 22:58:14	~Jesse	is docker an os?
2018-04-17 22:58:37	&Galen	no, it's a container system
2018-04-17 22:58:47	~Jesse	it seemed like a package manager when I was looking into it
2018-04-17 22:58:56	&Galen	it's a bit of both I guess
2018-04-17 22:59:13	&Galen	basically, a container is like a VM that runs directly on the host's kernel
2018-04-17 22:59:26	&Galen	rather than emulating the entire hardware stack
2018-04-17 22:59:47	&Galen	which is nice because it is pretty much bare-metal performance, since it's essentially running as a user process
2018-04-17 23:00:40	&Galen	docker is a specific implementation of containers that are designed to run a specific piece of software in each container (as opposed to something like lxc, which is what I run in my lab, which is designed to run it's own namespace, so it functions pretty similarly to a separate linux install but is still logically partitioned)
2018-04-17 23:01:06	&Galen	with docker, you can define 'dockerfiles', which is basically just a spec on how to build a container
2018-04-17 23:01:38	&Galen	so you make a dockerfile that contains logic to install and run a piece of software, then you hand the dockerfile off to the docker daemon, and it pulls the necessary components and spins up a container
2018-04-17 23:01:55	&Galen	which means it's super easy to use docker to distribute software and make sure things are consistent
2018-04-17 23:02:19	&Galen	and it also makes installing software easier bc you don't really need to know how to install it, you can just pull a dockerfile and run it
2018-04-17 23:02:37	&Galen	it's sort of like having a bash script that does all of your installs but more robust and platform independent
2018-04-17 23:03:02	&Galen	what's also nice is that all the logic and dependencies are contained in the docker image, which you can remove after you're done with it
2018-04-17 23:03:12	&Galen	so it doesn't end up polluting your system with a bunch of dependencies
2018-04-17 23:03:16	~Jesse	That sounds kinda neat. dependency management across alll these git repos and programming projects is screwing up things lol. 
2018-04-17 23:03:35	&Galen	xD yeah it's a pretty neat sys
2018-04-17 23:04:07	&Galen	it works really well with the gitlab ci because you don't have to pre install all the dependencies and stuff on the base system
2018-04-17 23:04:15	~Jesse	oh you want to install firefox... you'll have to also install porn-hub2.6 on your computer... sure hope you don't have the updated version of that xD
2018-04-17 23:04:25	&Galen	you can just say, 'here's docker images that have my dependencies, pull them and run my code'
2018-04-17 23:04:38	&Galen	lol xD
2018-04-17 23:04:46	&Galen	sudo pacman -S porn-hub
2018-04-17 23:05:11	~Jesse	*goes and checks if that's a real package*
2018-04-17 23:05:18	&Galen	lol
2018-04-17 23:05:22	~Jesse	it's not
2018-04-17 23:05:25	&Galen	rip
2018-04-17 23:05:27	~Jesse	good.
2018-04-17 23:05:33	&Galen	guess I know what our project over the summer is xD
2018-04-17 23:05:59	&Galen	did you get anything back from dr. adams?
2018-04-17 23:06:55	~Jesse	Maybe we should make it so that people have to submit answers to P vs NP before the program can work... This is how we can solve PvNP
2018-04-17 23:07:16	~Jesse	and nope
2018-04-17 23:07:30	&Galen	lol xD
2018-04-17 23:07:33	~Jesse	I honestly don't think shes gonna give a crap.
2018-04-17 23:07:41	&Galen	maybe not, we'll see tho
2018-04-17 23:07:51	&Galen	if you sent it around plm time she probably already went home
2018-04-17 23:08:02	&Galen	I imagine she'll at least have the courtesy to send you a response
2018-04-17 23:10:41	&Galen	also I've been working on a dotfile templater if you want to check it out / help improve it at some point
2018-04-17 23:14:36	~Jesse	yeah sure dude. i'm taking a test right now, so I won't play with it yet
2018-04-17 23:16:05	&Galen	oh rip, what class?
2018-04-17 23:16:15	~Jesse	PHI 340
2018-04-17 23:16:26	~Jesse	I only need a 16% I think
2018-04-17 23:16:33	~Jesse	so I don't care too much
2018-04-17 23:16:33	&Galen	also yeah, no hurry, figure you might be able to make some use of it, or at least give me some design ideas :)
2018-04-17 23:16:35	&Galen	oh lol xD
2018-04-17 23:16:37	&Galen	nice
2018-04-17 23:18:36	&Galen	https://git.galenabell.com/gjabell/pydots
2018-04-17 23:18:52	&Galen	when you feel like looking at some incomplete code xD
2018-04-18 16:15:05	~Jesse	you seeing this crap? new due date is may 10th... a day after final exams are done.
2018-04-18 16:17:01	~Jesse	i guess thats not a bad solution. But it still shouldnt be allowed since thats during a time that the class should have ended.
2018-04-18 16:17:44	~Jesse	wo... they just deleted the message lol
2018-04-18 16:18:42	~Jesse	it would have given them a day to grade all of our papers lol
2018-04-18 16:18:56	~Jesse	cuz all grades have to be in on the 11th
2018-04-19 11:47:41	~Jesse	Dr. adams told me that it wasnt a violation and pointed out the specific rule which was worded differently from the ncsu calendar.
2018-04-19 11:47:41		it made for an awkward phone call lol, but she was nice.
2018-04-19 11:48:15	&Galen	Ah
2018-04-19 11:48:15		That's good at least
2018-04-19 11:51:02	~Jesse	yeah. she kinda gave me the option to say "hey make it due before exam week" but I wouldnt do that to ya lol.
2018-04-19 12:00:17	&Galen	Lol xD I appreciate it
2018-04-19 12:26:31	&Galen	do you know if images work on your server?
2018-04-19 12:26:38	&Galen	my mom tried sending me an image and it didn't go through
2018-04-19 12:27:05	~Jesse	everything is visible through riot.
2018-04-19 12:27:14	~Jesse	idk about the web interface
2018-04-19 12:27:18	&Galen	hmm
2018-04-19 12:27:23	&Galen	she sent it to me with the app
2018-04-19 12:28:21	~Jesse	weird. If ya want, I can give her a username through my raspberry pi. I feel like that would eat at your soul though haha.
2018-04-19 12:28:32	&Galen	xD a little yea
2018-04-19 12:28:45	&Galen	it's not a big deal but I want to try and fix it if it's a bad config on my end lol
2018-04-19 12:28:52	&Galen	are you using sqlite or postgres for your db?
2018-04-19 12:30:48	~Jesse	im not sure how to check lol. I have some postgres stuff so unless it's named template0 or template1 then maybe sqlite?
2018-04-19 12:31:09	&Galen	prolly sqlite, I Think that's the default
2018-04-19 12:31:22	&Galen	so unless you specifically decided to go postgres I'm guessing that's what you have
2018-04-19 12:31:24	~Jesse	thats a shame, I'm so used to postgres
2018-04-19 12:31:29	&Galen	which is the same as mine, so I guess that's not it...
2018-04-19 12:31:31	&Galen	xD
2018-04-19 12:31:42	~Jesse	i may have made it postgres somewhere.
2018-04-19 12:31:43	&Galen	you can always change it, I think I might soon cause I like pg better too lol
2018-04-19 12:32:34	~Jesse	its sqlite3
2018-04-19 12:32:45	&Galen	ok
2018-04-19 12:33:10	~Jesse	I wonder if I can find my texts in the db
2018-04-19 12:34:24	&Galen	prolly, unless they are end-2-end encrypted
2018-04-19 12:36:18	~Jesse	the passwords are encrypted so thats good.
2018-04-19 12:36:32	~Jesse	I had to be sure I didn't accidently phish you xD
2018-04-19 12:36:37	&Galen	I would hope so xD
2018-04-19 12:36:52	&Galen	is my password on your server tho?
2018-04-19 12:37:01	&Galen	cause I'd imagine it's only on mine
2018-04-19 12:37:12	&Galen	also it's unfortunate this doesn't support two factor
2018-04-19 12:37:48	&Galen	also I found a neat website
2018-04-19 12:38:04	&Galen	http://wttr.in/Raleigh?lang=en
2018-04-19 12:38:06	~Jesse	nah your pw is not on mine. 
2018-04-19 12:38:09	&Galen	ok
2018-04-19 12:38:14	&Galen	that's probably good lol
2018-04-19 12:38:15	~Jesse	and yeah I've seen that.
2018-04-19 12:38:23	&Galen	what's cool is you can curl it
2018-04-19 12:38:27	&Galen	since it's all text
2018-04-19 12:38:51	&Galen	so I found a script for weechat yesterday that lets me type '/weather' and it'll open a new buffer with the weather inside :)
2018-04-19 12:39:58	&Galen	weird
2018-04-19 12:40:05	&Galen	so I can see images just fine if I upload them,
2018-04-19 12:40:11	&Galen	can you try sending me one?
2018-04-19 12:40:29	~Jesse	an image?
2018-04-19 12:40:34	&Galen	yea
2018-04-19 12:41:51	~Jesse	https://matrix.jessesimpsoncodes.com/_matrix/media/v1/download/matrix.jessesimpsoncodes.com/LWSNpOKUHBfrPTQmmaZxFKpo/IMG_20170716_144103.jpg
2018-04-19 12:42:03	&Galen	lol xD
2018-04-19 12:42:07	&Galen	yaeh that works for me
2018-04-19 12:42:14	&Galen	weird, must just be on my mom's end
2018-04-19 12:42:23	&Galen	maybe it's because she has an iphone or something
2018-04-19 12:43:15	~Jesse	Also, I'm not sure that any information is being stored on the pi. I can't find any messages.
2018-04-19 12:43:30	&Galen	well it's got to be there somewhere
2018-04-19 12:43:33	~Jesse	but i guess it wouldn't make sense otherwise...
2018-04-19 12:47:47	~Jesse	Do you think the chat information would be under 'events'?
2018-04-19 12:48:19	&Galen	might be
2018-04-19 12:50:05	~Jesse	I found the messages. They're under event_search.
2018-04-19 12:50:12	&Galen	weird
2018-04-19 12:50:23	~Jesse	it's stored in plaintext. so josh could log into my pi and get it all
2018-04-19 12:50:43	&Galen	yeah
2018-04-19 12:50:48	&Galen	but that's what e2e is for
2018-04-19 12:52:33	~Jesse	yeah. I wasn't sure if they had that built in or not. 
2018-04-19 12:52:46	&Galen	it is built in but you have to enable it for the room
2018-04-19 12:53:36	~Jesse	riot will say (not encrypted), but I'm wondering if that only encrypts it from riot ->  matrix  and matrix -> riot rather than just matrix to itself.
2018-04-19 12:54:02	~Jesse	I guess if riot is just a front-end, then it wouldn't matter.
2018-04-19 12:54:33	&Galen	well, if it's over https then the traffic from riot will be encrypted with the server's public key before it is sent over the network, then the server will decrypt it, store it, parse it etc.
2018-04-19 12:55:03	&Galen	and it will be sent encrypted from the server to your phone / webapp on the other end, and decrypted locally so you can see it
2018-04-19 12:55:16	&Galen	but if it isn't e2e encrypted than the server will still have the plaintext version
2018-04-19 12:55:40	&Galen	if it's e2e, all of that will still happen but the message will first be encrypted with the e2e key before it is encrypted and sent over the network
2018-04-19 12:55:53	&Galen	and the server doesn't know the key so it stays encrypted on the server
2018-04-19 12:56:16	&Galen	then when it gets to your phone it gets decrypted from the server, and then the e2e gets decrypted so you can read it
2018-04-19 12:56:38	~Jesse	Yeah, and I guess Josh shouldn't be able to get into my Pi unless he had my ssh key, so it shouldn't matter...  
2018-04-19 12:56:58	&Galen	as long as your pi is secure then no one except you would be able to read the messages
2018-04-19 12:57:17	&Galen	if you wanted to be truly secure you'd use e2e but that seems fairly unnecessary since you control the server
2018-04-19 12:57:33	&Galen	so as long as no one can get in you wouldn't be leaking anything
2018-04-19 12:57:45	~Jesse	But if 2 users on my system want to talk to eachother, I could see it all (muahahaha)
2018-04-19 12:57:52	&Galen	yep :D
2018-04-19 12:57:59	&Galen	unless they were e2e
2018-04-19 12:58:02	~Jesse	:D I'm okay with this.
2018-04-19 12:58:30	~Jesse	I doubt anyone but me is gonna actually use my chatserver lol.
2018-04-19 12:58:38	&Galen	probably not
2018-04-19 12:58:40	~Jesse	also did you just make 2 new rooms?
2018-04-19 12:58:42	&Galen	also ignore those invites
2018-04-19 12:58:48	&Galen	I didn't mean to do that
2018-04-19 12:59:01	&Galen	apparently if I click on your name in the sidebar it invites you to a private channel xD
2018-04-19 12:59:50	&Galen	also it's kinda neat, on riot it'll show you people's power levels
2018-04-19 12:59:57	&Galen	so we both show up as power level 100s
2018-04-19 13:00:09	~Jesse	what do power levels do?
2018-04-19 13:00:19	&Galen	I think it's just admin / non-admin
2018-04-19 13:00:28	~Jesse	are we both admin?
2018-04-19 13:00:35	&Galen	I would hope so
2018-04-19 13:00:53	 *	Galen invited @_neb_wikipedia:matrix.org to join
2018-04-19 13:01:11	-->	_neb_wikipedia (@_neb_wikipedia:matrix.org) joined the room.
2018-04-19 13:04:56	<--	Jesse left the room.
2018-04-19 13:07:12	&Galen	for me it changed from Jesse to the wiki bots name + Jesse, so I changed it back
2018-04-19 13:07:18	&Galen	but I guess it changed it for you too lol
2018-04-19 13:07:36	~Jesse	check if it's Galen now lol
2018-04-19 13:07:41	&Galen	yep xD

2018-02-12 11:02:37	mdkowole	I have the script to extract symptoms from nord. I?ll need to add a second filter but that?s ok. My question is how to put it into Postgres. Do you want a column for each symptom or on blob for each disease(easier)?if it?s a column, I can only give generic labels. They vary with each disease  
2018-02-12 11:03:37	mdkowole	I figured you could search the blob for the key words.  
2018-02-12 11:04:14	mejohn	blob works for django search. Makes graph db a little harder, but django's our focus right now 
2018-02-12 11:05:03	mdkowole	10-4 
2018-02-12 11:09:02	mejohn	Does the gene_id in allele_gene relate to the mim number in any way? 
2018-02-12 11:32:19	mdkowole	I need to check 
2018-02-12 11:32:44	mdkowole	What database do you want the symptoms table in? 
2018-02-12 11:45:22	mejohn	where'd you pull the info from? a different source? We've combined all of the tabels into one database for production, so it really doesn't matter anymore 
2018-02-12 11:46:53	mdkowole	I haven?t pulled the trigger yet. I?m setting up the script and want to  create a table to send the data to. The source is nord  
2018-02-12 11:47:26	mdkowole	Two columns. Disease and symptoms  
2018-02-12 11:48:15	mdkowole	Will do test of about 20 before I do all 7000 
2018-02-12 11:48:48	mejohn	put it in fda for now, with the orphan drugs 
2018-02-12 11:48:57	mdkowole	Ok  
2018-02-12 12:49:55	msbrown3	Mike, did you ever get the rest of the datafiles from http://orphadata.org (orphadata.org)? 
2018-02-12 12:52:08	mdkowole	No. I focused on getting symptoms from nord. I figured that we had to wait to hear back from orphadata before we did anything. About to harvest symptoms from nord  
2018-02-12 12:58:40	msbrown3	Ok. Let me know when you hear back from them. I wanted to see what they have in those extra datasets, maybe incorporate it on rarediseases.oscar. Looks like it doesn't directly include the symptoms that you're scraping, so it's good you're doing that. 
2018-02-12 13:27:55	mdkowole	I?m close. Just need Megan to fix the Postgres piece. Can?t get the script right regarding writing to dB.  
2018-02-12 13:28:06	mdkowole	I?ll send to you as well 
2018-02-13 12:57:23	mdkowole	The symptoms table is in the fda database. Should be populated by 12:30. I?ve added a pdf to drive that shows how it is used to trigger data collection based on symptoms. It?s referred to as the hpo table in the PDF [:+1:2] 
2018-02-13 13:12:27	mejohn	agensgraph 1.3 doesn't support string matching clauses (LIKE, CONTAINS, etc) so we can build the relationships in sql and then translate to edges, or wait for them to fix it. Was trying to use it for 'if nih grant abstract contains disease name, add edge' 
2018-02-13 13:14:07	mdkowole	I?d go with the former. Figure you make the association and use a verb(or category/relationship) for edge.  
2018-02-13 13:14:29	mejohn	ok 
2018-02-14 08:47:46	mejohn	Any objections to merging our data to one database? I think it's fine to have separate ones for tables that we're still figuring out a schema for, but keeping data separate by source makes it harder to create relationships. 
2018-02-20 08:29:44	msbrown3	@mdkowole, have you heard back from the OrphaData people yet about getting their whole dataset?

2018-02-23 17:29:09		we lost functionality of location searching for hospitals ans specialists (just haven't implemented in new ui) will work on later this weekend unless it's necessary asap 
2018-02-28 09:40:37	mejohn	@Arun @Janne @jesse @Sagar just checking in before the meeting tomorrow, how is associating specialists with their rare diseases going? 
2018-02-28 09:55:53	jesse	Hey Meaghan. It's going okay. I found an issue with the pubmed data containing a lot of duplicates, which I wrote a quick program to resolve. The duplicates were coming in because when we searched for multiple different rare diseases, we would get back the same article. 
2018-02-28 09:55:53		There are a couple other issues as well. When we filtered the pubmed data to only include NC, we got only the pubmed articles which had an author's associated medical school in NC. Contrast this to the specialists data, which was filtered to only include specialists whose hospital was in NC... Many specialists came from another state and now work for a hospital in north carolina and many specialists went to a medical school in NC and left to work at a hospital from another state. 
2018-02-28 09:55:53		So we would only get people who went to a medical school in NC and worked at a hospital in NC, which wouldn't get very many hits with the pubmed data. (but did get hits from Michael Knowles, and a few other physicians.)
2018-02-28 09:55:53		A possible solution would be to get all of the pubmed articles and match that to every specialist in USA. I found a data set that would include all these specialists as well as a few fields we don't have (which would include the hospital they work for and the medical school they went to) (but probably not gps coordinates). 
2018-02-28 10:00:21	mdkowole	Remember they could have done research outside of nc or school outside of nc but are here now 
2018-02-28 10:00:28	msbrown3	If we have the hospital they work at, we can geolocate it to get GPS coordinates or zipcode [:+1:1] 
2018-02-28 10:01:33	mejohn	neat! I'm glad you resolved the issues with pubmed. If it won't take too much more time, I think that your solution sounds like the best way forward that's also future-proof. I'm okay with not having direct gps coordinates right now. We are hoping to have something to show off that we can make the specialists search smart by the meeting next thursday (not tomorrow). Is there anything Michael or I could help with to get that done? 
2018-02-28 10:07:45	jesse	Sagar and I were having trouble comparing the medical school that the physicians went to with the medical school listed under the pubmed article. UNC Chapel Hill School of Medicine would be an easy example, as stripping away the nonsense would just leave Chapel Hill.... But   trying to compare some of the other schools, like North Carolina State University is difficult because there are no unique words in North Carolina State University. 
2018-02-28 10:13:39	jesse	This is the physicians data I have been using: 
2018-02-28 10:13:39		https://data.medicare.gov/Physician-Compare/Physician-Compare-National-Downloadable-File/mj5m-pzi6 
2018-02-28 10:13:39		and as for getting the pubmed data set for all of the united states (probably would contain other countries too), I've been looking here:
2018-02-28 10:13:39		https://www.nlm.nih.gov/databases/download/pubmed_medline.html
2018-02-28 10:13:39		I was going to look for a convenient way of turning the XML stuff into postgres. It provides full sets of the data yearly with daily updates.... if we tried to webscrape all of the pubmed stuff... I'm roughly estimating that would take at least 300 hours... but downloading it directly shouldn't take much time at all.  (edited)
2018-02-28 10:14:23	jesse	That basically sums up what I've been doing/looking into for the week. :slightly_smiling_face: 
2018-02-28 10:15:42	jesse	I got the first link from Thomas' team in 495 class btw. 
2018-02-28 18:21:58	jesse	That 300 hour thing was completely false.... based on the test I just ran, it would take about 22 hours to generate all of the pubmed articles relating to rare diseases using the scraper I made. (i think this will be preferable to downloading all of pubmed... but that is still an option) 
2018-02-28 18:23:00	mejohn	Michael does have a way to go from xml to Django, that might be worth exploring tomorrow 
2018-02-28 18:23:44	jesse	sure. I'll still have the script run in case we want those csv's. [:+1:1]

2018-02-23 17:29:09		we lost functionality of location searching for hospitals ans specialists (just haven't implemented in new ui) will work on later this weekend unless it's necessary asap 
2018-02-28 09:40:37	mejohn	@Arun @Janne @jesse @Sagar just checking in before the meeting tomorrow, how is associating specialists with their rare diseases going? 
2018-02-28 09:55:53	jesse	Hey Meaghan. It's going okay. I found an issue with the pubmed data containing a lot of duplicates, which I wrote a quick program to resolve. The duplicates were coming in because when we searched for multiple different rare diseases, we would get back the same article. 
2018-02-28 09:55:53		There are a couple other issues as well. When we filtered the pubmed data to only include NC, we got only the pubmed articles which had an author's associated medical school in NC. Contrast this to the specialists data, which was filtered to only include specialists whose hospital was in NC... Many specialists came from another state and now work for a hospital in north carolina and many specialists went to a medical school in NC and left to work at a hospital from another state. 
2018-02-28 09:55:53		So we would only get people who went to a medical school in NC and worked at a hospital in NC, which wouldn't get very many hits with the pubmed data. (but did get hits from Michael Knowles, and a few other physicians.)
2018-02-28 09:55:53		A possible solution would be to get all of the pubmed articles and match that to every specialist in USA. I found a data set that would include all these specialists as well as a few fields we don't have (which would include the hospital they work for and the medical school they went to) (but probably not gps coordinates). 
2018-02-28 10:00:21	mdkowole	Remember they could have done research outside of nc or school outside of nc but are here now 
2018-02-28 10:00:28	msbrown3	If we have the hospital they work at, we can geolocate it to get GPS coordinates or zipcode [:+1:1] 
2018-02-28 10:01:33	mejohn	neat! I'm glad you resolved the issues with pubmed. If it won't take too much more time, I think that your solution sounds like the best way forward that's also future-proof. I'm okay with not having direct gps coordinates right now. We are hoping to have something to show off that we can make the specialists search smart by the meeting next thursday (not tomorrow). Is there anything Michael or I could help with to get that done? 
2018-02-28 10:07:45	jesse	Sagar and I were having trouble comparing the medical school that the physicians went to with the medical school listed under the pubmed article. UNC Chapel Hill School of Medicine would be an easy example, as stripping away the nonsense would just leave Chapel Hill.... But   trying to compare some of the other schools, like North Carolina State University is difficult because there are no unique words in North Carolina State University. 
2018-02-28 10:13:39	jesse	This is the physicians data I have been using: 
2018-02-28 10:13:39		https://data.medicare.gov/Physician-Compare/Physician-Compare-National-Downloadable-File/mj5m-pzi6 
2018-02-28 10:13:39		and as for getting the pubmed data set for all of the united states (probably would contain other countries too), I've been looking here:
2018-02-28 10:13:39		https://www.nlm.nih.gov/databases/download/pubmed_medline.html
2018-02-28 10:13:39		I was going to look for a convenient way of turning the XML stuff into postgres. It provides full sets of the data yearly with daily updates.... if we tried to webscrape all of the pubmed stuff... I'm roughly estimating that would take at least 300 hours... but downloading it directly shouldn't take much time at all.  (edited)
2018-02-28 10:14:23	jesse	That basically sums up what I've been doing/looking into for the week. :slightly_smiling_face: 
2018-02-28 10:15:42	jesse	I got the first link from Thomas' team in 495 class btw. 
2018-02-28 18:21:58	jesse	That 300 hour thing was completely false.... based on the test I just ran, it would take about 22 hours to generate all of the pubmed articles relating to rare diseases using the scraper I made. (i think this will be preferable to downloading all of pubmed... but that is still an option) 
2018-02-28 18:23:00	mejohn	Michael does have a way to go from xml to Django, that might be worth exploring tomorrow 
2018-02-28 18:23:44	jesse	sure. I'll still have the script run in case we want those csv's. [:+1:1]

2018-02-12 11:02:37	mdkowole	I have the script to extract symptoms from nord. I?ll need to add a second filter but that?s ok. My question is how to put it into Postgres. Do you want a column for each symptom or on blob for each disease(easier)?if it?s a column, I can only give generic labels. They vary with each disease  
2018-02-12 11:03:37	mdkowole	I figured you could search the blob for the key words.  
2018-02-12 11:04:14	mejohn	blob works for django search. Makes graph db a little harder, but django's our focus right now 
2018-02-12 11:05:03	mdkowole	10-4 
2018-02-12 11:09:02	mejohn	Does the gene_id in allele_gene relate to the mim number in any way? 
2018-02-12 11:32:19	mdkowole	I need to check 
2018-02-12 11:32:44	mdkowole	What database do you want the symptoms table in? 
2018-02-12 11:45:22	mejohn	where'd you pull the info from? a different source? We've combined all of the tabels into one database for production, so it really doesn't matter anymore 
2018-02-12 11:46:53	mdkowole	I haven?t pulled the trigger yet. I?m setting up the script and want to  create a table to send the data to. The source is nord  
2018-02-12 11:47:26	mdkowole	Two columns. Disease and symptoms  
2018-02-12 11:48:15	mdkowole	Will do test of about 20 before I do all 7000 
2018-02-12 11:48:48	mejohn	put it in fda for now, with the orphan drugs 
2018-02-12 11:48:57	mdkowole	Ok  
2018-02-12 12:49:55	msbrown3	Mike, did you ever get the rest of the datafiles from http://orphadata.org (orphadata.org)? 
2018-02-12 12:52:08	mdkowole	No. I focused on getting symptoms from nord. I figured that we had to wait to hear back from orphadata before we did anything. About to harvest symptoms from nord  
2018-02-12 12:58:40	msbrown3	Ok. Let me know when you hear back from them. I wanted to see what they have in those extra datasets, maybe incorporate it on rarediseases.oscar. Looks like it doesn't directly include the symptoms that you're scraping, so it's good you're doing that. 
2018-02-12 13:27:55	mdkowole	I?m close. Just need Megan to fix the Postgres piece. Can?t get the script right regarding writing to dB.  
2018-02-12 13:28:06	mdkowole	I?ll send to you as well 
2018-02-13 12:57:23	mdkowole	The symptoms table is in the fda database. Should be populated by 12:30. I?ve added a pdf to drive that shows how it is used to trigger data collection based on symptoms. It?s referred to as the hpo table in the PDF [:+1:2] 
2018-02-13 13:12:27	mejohn	agensgraph 1.3 doesn't support string matching clauses (LIKE, CONTAINS, etc) so we can build the relationships in sql and then translate to edges, or wait for them to fix it. Was trying to use it for 'if nih grant abstract contains disease name, add edge' 
2018-02-13 13:14:07	mdkowole	I?d go with the former. Figure you make the association and use a verb(or category/relationship) for edge.  
2018-02-13 13:14:29	mejohn	ok 
2018-02-14 08:47:46	mejohn	Any objections to merging our data to one database? I think it's fine to have separate ones for tables that we're still figuring out a schema for, but keeping data separate by source makes it harder to create relationships. 
2018-02-20 08:29:44	msbrown3	@mdkowole, have you heard back from the OrphaData people yet about getting their whole dataset?

2018-02-12 11:02:37	mdkowole	I have the script to extract symptoms from nord. I?ll need to add a second filter but that?s ok. My question is how to put it into Postgres. Do you want a column for each symptom or on blob for each disease(easier)?if it?s a column, I can only give generic labels. They vary with each disease  
2018-02-12 11:03:37	mdkowole	I figured you could search the blob for the key words.  
2018-02-12 11:04:14	mejohn	blob works for django search. Makes graph db a little harder, but django's our focus right now 
2018-02-12 11:05:03	mdkowole	10-4 
2018-02-12 11:09:02	mejohn	Does the gene_id in allele_gene relate to the mim number in any way? 
2018-02-12 11:32:19	mdkowole	I need to check 
2018-02-12 11:32:44	mdkowole	What database do you want the symptoms table in? 
2018-02-12 11:45:22	mejohn	where'd you pull the info from? a different source? We've combined all of the tabels into one database for production, so it really doesn't matter anymore 
2018-02-12 11:46:53	mdkowole	I haven?t pulled the trigger yet. I?m setting up the script and want to  create a table to send the data to. The source is nord  
2018-02-12 11:47:26	mdkowole	Two columns. Disease and symptoms  
2018-02-12 11:48:15	mdkowole	Will do test of about 20 before I do all 7000 
2018-02-12 11:48:48	mejohn	put it in fda for now, with the orphan drugs 
2018-02-12 11:48:57	mdkowole	Ok  
2018-02-12 12:49:55	msbrown3	Mike, did you ever get the rest of the datafiles from http://orphadata.org (orphadata.org)? 
2018-02-12 12:52:08	mdkowole	No. I focused on getting symptoms from nord. I figured that we had to wait to hear back from orphadata before we did anything. About to harvest symptoms from nord  
2018-02-12 12:58:40	msbrown3	Ok. Let me know when you hear back from them. I wanted to see what they have in those extra datasets, maybe incorporate it on rarediseases.oscar. Looks like it doesn't directly include the symptoms that you're scraping, so it's good you're doing that. 
2018-02-12 13:27:55	mdkowole	I?m close. Just need Megan to fix the Postgres piece. Can?t get the script right regarding writing to dB.

2018-02-13 12:57:23	mdkowole	The symptoms table is in the fda database. Should be populated by 12:30. I?ve added a pdf to drive that shows how it is used to trigger data collection based on symptoms. It?s referred to as the hpo table in the PDF [:+1:2] 
2018-02-13 13:12:27	mejohn	agensgraph 1.3 doesn't support string matching clauses (LIKE, CONTAINS, etc) so we can build the relationships in sql and then translate to edges, or wait for them to fix it. Was trying to use it for 'if nih grant abstract contains disease name, add edge' 
2018-02-13 13:14:07	mdkowole	I?d go with the former. Figure you make the association and use a verb(or category/relationship) for edge.  
2018-02-13 13:14:29	mejohn	ok 
2018-02-14 08:47:46	mejohn	Any objections to merging our data to one database? I think it's fine to have separate ones for tables that we're still figuring out a schema for, but keeping data separate by source makes it harder to create relationships. 
2018-02-20 08:29:44	msbrown3	@mdkowole, have you heard back from the OrphaData people yet about getting their whole dataset?

2018-02-23 17:29:09		we lost functionality of location searching for hospitals ans specialists (just haven't implemented in new ui) will work on later this weekend unless it's necessary asap 
2018-02-28 09:40:37	mejohn	@Arun @Janne @jesse @Sagar just checking in before the meeting tomorrow, how is associating specialists with their rare diseases going? 
2018-02-28 09:55:53	jesse	Hey Meaghan. It's going okay. I found an issue with the pubmed data containing a lot of duplicates, which I wrote a quick program to resolve. The duplicates were coming in because when we searched for multiple different rare diseases, we would get back the same article. 
2018-02-28 09:55:53		There are a couple other issues as well. When we filtered the pubmed data to only include NC, we got only the pubmed articles which had an author's associated medical school in NC. Contrast this to the specialists data, which was filtered to only include specialists whose hospital was in NC... Many specialists came from another state and now work for a hospital in north carolina and many specialists went to a medical school in NC and left to work at a hospital from another state. 
2018-02-28 09:55:53		So we would only get people who went to a medical school in NC and worked at a hospital in NC, which wouldn't get very many hits with the pubmed data. (but did get hits from Michael Knowles, and a few other physicians.)
2018-02-28 09:55:53		A possible solution would be to get all of the pubmed articles and match that to every specialist in USA. I found a data set that would include all these specialists as well as a few fields we don't have (which would include the hospital they work for and the medical school they went to) (but probably not gps coordinates). 
2018-02-28 10:00:21	mdkowole	Remember they could have done research outside of nc or school outside of nc but are here now 
2018-02-28 10:00:28	msbrown3	If we have the hospital they work at, we can geolocate it to get GPS coordinates or zipcode [:+1:1] 
2018-02-28 10:01:33	mejohn	neat! I'm glad you resolved the issues with pubmed. If it won't take too much more time, I think that your solution sounds like the best way forward that's also future-proof. I'm okay with not having direct gps coordinates right now. We are hoping to have something to show off that we can make the specialists search smart by the meeting next thursday (not tomorrow). Is there anything Michael or I could help with to get that done? 
2018-02-28 10:07:45	jesse	Sagar and I were having trouble comparing the medical school that the physicians went to with the medical school listed under the pubmed article. UNC Chapel Hill School of Medicine would be an easy example, as stripping away the nonsense would just leave Chapel Hill.... But   trying to compare some of the other schools, like North Carolina State University is difficult because there are no unique words in North Carolina State University. 
2018-02-28 10:13:39	jesse	This is the physicians data I have been using: 
2018-02-28 10:13:39		https://data.medicare.gov/Physician-Compare/Physician-Compare-National-Downloadable-File/mj5m-pzi6 
2018-02-28 10:13:39		and as for getting the pubmed data set for all of the united states (probably would contain other countries too), I've been looking here:
2018-02-28 10:13:39		https://www.nlm.nih.gov/databases/download/pubmed_medline.html
2018-02-28 10:13:39		I was going to look for a convenient way of turning the XML stuff into postgres. It provides full sets of the data yearly with daily updates.... if we tried to webscrape all of the pubmed stuff... I'm roughly estimating that would take at least 300 hours... but downloading it directly shouldn't take much time at all.  (edited)
2018-02-28 10:14:23	jesse	That basically sums up what I've been doing/looking into for the week. :slightly_smiling_face: 
2018-02-28 10:15:42	jesse	I got the first link from Thomas' team in 495 class btw. 
2018-02-28 18:21:58	jesse	That 300 hour thing was completely false.... based on the test I just ran, it would take about 22 hours to generate all of the pubmed articles relating to rare diseases using the scraper I made. (i think this will be preferable to downloading all of pubmed... but that is still an option) 
2018-02-28 18:23:00	mejohn	Michael does have a way to go from xml to Django, that might be worth exploring tomorrow 
2018-02-28 18:23:44	jesse	sure. I'll still have the script run in case we want those csv's. [:+1:1]

When we filtered the pubmed data to only include NC, we got only the pubmed articles which had an author's associated medical school in NC. Contrast this to the specialists data, which was filtered to only include specialists whose hospital was in NC... Many specialists came from another state and now work for a hospital in north carolina and many specialists went to a medical school in NC and left to work at a hospital from another state. 
2018-02-28 09:55:53		So we would only get people who went to a medical school in NC and worked at a hospital in NC, which wouldn't get very many hits with the pubmed data. (but did get hits from Michael Knowles, and a few other physicians.)
2018-02-28 09:55:53		A possible solution would be to get all of the pubmed articles and match that to every specialist in USA. I found a data set that would include all these specialists as well as a few fields we don't have (which would include the hospital they work for and the medical school they went to) (but probably not gps coordinates). 
2018-02-28 10:00:21	mdkowole	Remember they could have done research outside of nc or school outside of nc but are here now 
2018-02-28 10:00:28	msbrown3	If we have the hospital they work at, we can geolocate it to get GPS coordinates or zipcode [:+1:1] 
2018-02-28 10:01:33	mejohn	neat! I'm glad you resolved the issues with pubmed. If it won't take too much more time, I think that your solution sounds like the best way forward that's also future-proof. I'm okay with not having direct gps coordinates right now. We are hoping to have something to show off that we can make the specialists search smart by the meeting next thursday (not tomorrow). Is there anything Michael or I could help with to get that done? 
2018-02-28 10:07:45	jesse	Sagar and I were having trouble comparing the medical school that the physicians went to with the medical school listed under the pubmed article. UNC Chapel Hill School of Medicine would be an easy example, as stripping away the nonsense would just leave Chapel Hill.... But   trying to compare some of the other schools, like North Carolina State University is difficult because there are no unique words in North Carolina State University. 
2018-02-28 10:13:39	jesse	This is the physicians data I have been using: 
2018-02-28 10:13:39		https://data.medicare.gov/Physician-Compare/Physician-Compare-National-Downloadable-File/mj5m-pzi6 
2018-02-28 10:13:39		and as for getting the pubmed data set for all of the united states (probably would contain other countries too), I've been looking here:
2018-02-28 10:13:39		https://www.nlm.nih.gov/databases/download/pubmed_medline.html
2018-02-28 10:13:39		I was going to look for a convenient way of turning the XML stuff into postgres. It provides full sets of the data yearly with daily updates.... if we tried to webscrape all of the pubmed stuff... I'm roughly estimating that would take at least 300 hours... but downloading it directly shouldn't take much time at all.  (edited)
2018-02-28 10:14:23	jesse	That basically sums up what I've been doing/looking into for the week. :slightly_smiling_face: 
2018-02-28 10:15:42	jesse	I got the first link from Thomas' team in 495 class btw. 
2018-02-28 18:21:58	jesse	That 300 hour thing was completely false.... based on the test I just ran, it would take about 22 hours to generate all of the pubmed articles relating to rare diseases using the scraper I made. (i think this will be preferable to downloading all of pubmed... but that is still an option) 
2018-02-28 18:23:00	mejohn	Michael does have a way to go from xml to Django, that might be worth exploring tomorrow 
2018-02-28 18:23:44	jesse	sure. I'll still have the script run in case we want those csv's. [:+1:1]

2018-02-12 11:02:37	mdkowole	I have the script to extract symptoms from nord. I?ll need to add a second filter but that?s ok. My question is how to put it into Postgres. Do you want a column for each symptom or on blob for each disease(easier)?if it?s a column, I can only give generic labels. They vary with each disease  
2018-02-12 11:03:37	mdkowole	I figured you could search the blob for the key words.  
2018-02-12 11:04:14	mejohn	blob works for django search. Makes graph db a little harder, but django's our focus right now 
2018-02-12 11:05:03	mdkowole	10-4 
2018-02-12 11:09:02	mejohn	Does the gene_id in allele_gene relate to the mim number in any way? 
2018-02-12 11:32:19	mdkowole	I need to check 
2018-02-12 11:32:44	mdkowole	What database do you want the symptoms table in? 
2018-02-12 11:45:22	mejohn	where'd you pull the info from? a different source? We've combined all of the tabels into one database for production, so it really doesn't matter anymore 
2018-02-12 11:46:53	mdkowole	I haven?t pulled the trigger yet. I?m setting up the script and want to  create a table to send the data to. The source is nord  
2018-02-12 11:47:26	mdkowole	Two columns. Disease and symptoms  
2018-02-12 11:48:15	mdkowole	Will do test of about 20 before I do all 7000 
2018-02-12 11:48:48	mejohn	put it in fda for now, with the orphan drugs 
2018-02-12 11:48:57	mdkowole	Ok  
2018-02-12 12:49:55	msbrown3	Mike, did you ever get the rest of the datafiles from http://orphadata.org (orphadata.org)? 
2018-02-12 12:52:08	mdkowole	No. I focused on getting symptoms from nord. I figured that we had to wait to hear back from orphadata before we did anything. About to harvest symptoms from nord  
2018-02-12 12:58:40	msbrown3	Ok. Let me know when you hear back from them. I wanted to see what they have in those extra datasets, maybe incorporate it on rarediseases.oscar. Looks like it doesn't directly include the symptoms that you're scraping, so it's good you're doing that. 
2018-02-12 13:27:55	mdkowole	I?m close. Just need Megan to fix the Postgres piece. Can?t get the script right regarding writing to dB.  
2018-02-12 13:28:06	mdkowole	I?ll send to you as well 
2018-02-13 12:57:23	mdkowole	The symptoms table is in the fda database. Should be populated by 12:30. I?ve added a pdf to drive that shows how it is used to trigger data collection based on symptoms. It?s referred to as the hpo table in the PDF [:+1:2] 
2018-02-13 13:12:27	mejohn	agensgraph 1.3 doesn't support string matching clauses (LIKE, CONTAINS, etc) so we can build the relationships in sql and then translate to edges, or wait for them to fix it. Was trying to use it for 'if nih grant abstract contains disease name, add edge' 
2018-02-13 13:14:07	mdkowole	I?d go with the former. Figure you make the association and use a verb(or category/relationship) for edge.  
2018-02-13 13:14:29	mejohn	ok 
2018-02-14 08:47:46	mejohn	Any objections to merging our data to one database? I think it's fine to have separate ones for tables that we're still figuring out a schema for, but keeping data separate by source makes it harder to create relationships. 
2018-02-20 08:29:44	msbrown3	@mdkowole, have you heard back from the OrphaData people yet about getting their whole dataset?

2018-02-12 11:02:37	mdkowole	I have the script to extract symptoms from nord. I?ll need to add a second filter but that?s ok. My question is how to put it into Postgres. Do you want a column for each symptom or on blob for each disease(easier)?if it?s a column, I can only give generic labels. They vary with each disease  
2018-02-12 11:03:37	mdkowole	I figured you could search the blob for the key words.  
2018-02-12 11:04:14	mejohn	blob works for django search. Makes graph db a little harder, but django's our focus right now 
2018-02-12 11:05:03	mdkowole	10-4 
2018-02-12 11:09:02	mejohn	Does the gene_id in allele_gene relate to the mim number in any way? 
2018-02-12 11:32:19	mdkowole	I need to check 
2018-02-12 11:32:44	mdkowole	What database do you want the symptoms table in? 
2018-02-12 11:45:22	mejohn	where'd you pull the info from? a different source? We've combined all of the tabels into one database for production, so it really doesn't matter anymore 
2018-02-12 11:46:53	mdkowole	I haven?t pulled the trigger yet. I?m setting up the script and want to  create a table to send the data to. The source is nord  
2018-02-12 11:47:26	mdkowole	Two columns. Disease and symptoms  
2018-02-12 11:48:15	mdkowole	Will do test of about 20 before I do all 7000 
2018-02-12 11:48:48	mejohn	put it in fda for now, with the orphan drugs 
2018-02-12 11:48:57	mdkowole	Ok  
2018-02-12 12:49:55	msbrown3	Mike, did you ever get the rest of the datafiles from http://orphadata.org (orphadata.org)? 
2018-02-12 12:52:08	mdkowole	No. I focused on getting symptoms from nord. I figured that we had to wait to hear back from orphadata before we did anything. About to harvest symptoms from nord  
2018-02-12 12:58:40	msbrown3	Ok. Let me know when you hear back from them. I wanted to see what they have in those extra datasets, maybe incorporate it on rarediseases.oscar. Looks like it doesn't directly include the symptoms that you're scraping, so it's good you're doing that. 
2018-02-12 13:27:55	mdkowole	I?m close. Just need Megan to fix the Postgres piece. Can?t get the script right regarding writing to dB.  
2018-02-12 13:28:06	mdkowole	I?ll send to you as well 
2018-02-13 12:57:23	mdkowole	The symptoms table is in the fda database. Should be populated by 12:30. I?ve added a pdf to drive that shows how it is used to trigger data collection based on symptoms. It?s referred to as the hpo table in the PDF [:+1:2] 
2018-02-13 13:12:27	mejohn	agensgraph 1.3 doesn't support string matching clauses (LIKE, CONTAINS, etc) so we can build the relationships in sql and then translate to edges, or wait for them to fix it. Was trying to use it for 'if nih grant abstract contains disease name, add edge' 
2018-02-13 13:14:07	mdkowole	I?d go with the former. Figure you make the association and use a verb(or category/relationship) for edge.  
2018-02-13 13:14:29	mejohn	ok 
2018-02-14 08:47:46	mejohn	Any objections to merging our data to one database? I think it's fine to have separate ones for tables that we're still figuring out a schema for, but keeping data separate by source makes it harder to create relationships. 
2018-02-20 08:29:44	msbrown3	@mdkowole, have you heard back from the OrphaData people yet about getting their whole dataset?

2018-02-23 17:29:09		we lost functionality of location searching for hospitals ans specialists (just haven't implemented in new ui) will work on later this weekend unless it's necessary asap 
2018-02-28 09:40:37	mejohn	@Arun @Janne @jesse @Sagar just checking in before the meeting tomorrow, how is associating specialists with their rare diseases going? 
2018-02-28 09:55:53	jesse	Hey Meaghan. It's going okay. I found an issue with the pubmed data containing a lot of duplicates, which I wrote a quick program to resolve. The duplicates were coming in because when we searched for multiple different rare diseases, we would get back the same article. 
2018-02-28 09:55:53		There are a couple other issues as well. When we filtered the pubmed data to only include NC, we got only the pubmed articles which had an author's associated medical school in NC. Contrast this to the specialists data, which was filtered to only include specialists whose hospital was in NC... Many specialists came from another state and now work for a hospital in north carolina and many specialists went to a medical school in NC and left to work at a hospital from another state. 
2018-02-28 09:55:53		So we would only get people who went to a medical school in NC and worked at a hospital in NC, which wouldn't get very many hits with the pubmed data. (but did get hits from Michael Knowles, and a few other physicians.)
2018-02-28 09:55:53		A possible solution would be to get all of the pubmed articles and match that to every specialist in USA. I found a data set that would include all these specialists as well as a few fields we don't have (which would include the hospital they work for and the medical school they went to) (but probably not gps coordinates). 
2018-02-28 10:00:21	mdkowole	Remember they could have done research outside of nc or school outside of nc but are here now 
2018-02-28 10:00:28	msbrown3	If we have the hospital they work at, we can geolocate it to get GPS coordinates or zipcode [:+1:1] 
2018-02-28 10:01:33	mejohn	neat! I'm glad you resolved the issues with pubmed. If it won't take too much more time, I think that your solution sounds like the best way forward that's also future-proof. I'm okay with not having direct gps coordinates right now. We are hoping to have something to show off that we can make the specialists search smart by the meeting next thursday (not tomorrow). Is there anything Michael or I could help with to get that done? 
2018-02-28 10:07:45	jesse	Sagar and I were having trouble comparing the medical school that the physicians went to with the medical school listed under the pubmed article. UNC Chapel Hill School of Medicine would be an easy example, as stripping away the nonsense would just leave Chapel Hill.... But   trying to compare some of the other schools, like North Carolina State University is difficult because there are no unique words in North Carolina State University. 
2018-02-28 10:13:39	jesse	This is the physicians data I have been using: 
2018-02-28 10:13:39		https://data.medicare.gov/Physician-Compare/Physician-Compare-National-Downloadable-File/mj5m-pzi6 
2018-02-28 10:13:39		and as for getting the pubmed data set for all of the united states (probably would contain other countries too), I've been looking here:
2018-02-28 10:13:39		https://www.nlm.nih.gov/databases/download/pubmed_medline.html
2018-02-28 10:13:39		I was going to look for a convenient way of turning the XML stuff into postgres. It provides full sets of the data yearly with daily updates.... if we tried to webscrape all of the pubmed stuff... I'm roughly estimating that would take at least 300 hours... but downloading it directly shouldn't take much time at all.  (edited)
2018-02-28 10:14:23	jesse	That basically sums up what I've been doing/looking into for the week. :slightly_smiling_face: 
2018-02-28 10:15:42	jesse	I got the first link from Thomas' team in 495 class btw. 
2018-02-28 18:21:58	jesse	That 300 hour thing was completely false.... based on the test I just ran, it would take about 22 hours to generate all of the pubmed articles relating to rare diseases using the scraper I made. (i think this will be preferable to downloading all of pubmed... but that is still an option) 
2018-02-28 18:23:00	mejohn	Michael does have a way to go from xml to Django, that might be worth exploring tomorrow 
2018-02-28 18:23:44	jesse	sure. I'll still have the script run in case we want those csv's. [:+1:1]

2018-02-12 13:27:55	mdkowole	I?m close. Just need Megan to fix the Postgres piece. Can?t get the script right regarding writing to dB.  
2018-02-12 13:28:06	mdkowole	I?ll send to you as well 
2018-02-13 12:57:23	mdkowole	The symptoms table is in the fda database. Should be populated by 12:30. I?ve added a pdf to drive that shows how it is used to trigger data collection based on symptoms. It?s referred to as the hpo table in the PDF [:+1:2] 
2018-02-13 13:12:27	mejohn	agensgraph 1.3 doesn't support string matching clauses (LIKE, CONTAINS, etc) so we can build the relationships in sql and then translate to edges, or wait for them to fix it. Was trying to use it for 'if nih grant abstract contains disease name, add edge' 
2018-02-13 13:14:07	mdkowole	I?d go with the former. Figure you make the association and use a verb(or category/relationship) for edge.  
2018-02-13 13:14:29	mejohn	ok 
2018-02-14 08:47:46	mejohn	Any objections to merging our data to one database? I think it's fine to have separate ones for tables that we're still figuring out a schema for, but keeping data separate by source makes it harder to create relationships.

2018-02-28 09:40:37	mejohn	@Arun @Janne @jesse @Sagar just checking in before the meeting tomorrow, how is associating specialists with their rare diseases going? 
2018-02-28 09:55:53	jesse	Hey Meaghan. It's going okay. I found an issue with the pubmed data containing a lot of duplicates, which I wrote a quick program to resolve. The duplicates were coming in because when we searched for multiple different rare diseases, we would get back the same article. 
2018-02-28 09:55:53		There are a couple other issues as well. When we filtered the pubmed data to only include NC, we got only the pubmed articles which had an author's associated medical school in NC. Contrast this to the specialists data, which was filtered to only include specialists whose hospital was in NC... Many specialists came from another state and now work for a hospital in north carolina and many specialists went to a medical school in NC and left to work at a hospital from another state. 
2018-02-28 09:55:53		So we would only get people who went to a medical school in NC and worked at a hospital in NC, which wouldn't get very many hits with the pubmed data. (but did get hits from Michael Knowles, and a few other physicians.)
2018-02-28 09:55:53		A possible solution would be to get all of the pubmed articles and match that to every specialist in USA. I found a data set that would include all these specialists as well as a few fields we don't have (which would include the hospital they work for and the medical school they went to) (but probably not gps coordinates). 
2018-02-28 10:00:21	mdkowole	Remember they could have done research outside of nc or school outside of nc but are here now 
2018-02-28 10:00:28	msbrown3	If we have the hospital they work at, we can geolocate it to get GPS coordinates or zipcode [:+1:1] 
2018-02-28 10:01:33	mejohn	neat! I'm glad you resolved the issues with pubmed. If it won't take too much more time, I think that your solution sounds like the best way forward that's also future-proof. I'm okay with not having direct gps coordinates right now. We are hoping to have something to show off that we can make the specialists search smart by the meeting next thursday (not tomorrow). Is there anything Michael or I could help with to get that done? 
2018-02-28 10:07:45	jesse	Sagar and I were having trouble comparing the medical school that the physicians went to with the medical school listed under the pubmed article. UNC Chapel Hill School of Medicine would be an easy example, as stripping away the nonsense would just leave Chapel Hill.... But   trying to compare some of the other schools, like North Carolina State University is difficult because there are no unique words in North Carolina State University. 
2018-02-28 10:13:39	jesse	This is the physicians data I have been using:

2018-02-28 10:13:39		and as for getting the pubmed data set for all of the united states (probably would contain other countries too), I've been looking here:
2018-02-28 10:13:39		https://www.nlm.nih.gov/databases/download/pubmed_medline.html
2018-02-28 10:13:39		I was going to look for a convenient way of turning the XML stuff into postgres. It provides full sets of the data yearly with daily updates.... if we tried to webscrape all of the pubmed stuff... I'm roughly estimating that would take at least 300 hours... but downloading it directly shouldn't take much time at all.  (edited)
2018-02-28 10:14:23	jesse	That basically sums up what I've been doing/looking into for the week. :slightly_smiling_face:

2018-02-28 18:21:58	jesse	That 300 hour thing was completely false.... based on the test I just ran, it would take about 22 hours to generate all of the pubmed articles relating to rare diseases using the scraper I made. (i think this will be preferable to downloading all of pubmed... but that is still an option) 
2018-02-28 18:23:00	mejohn	Michael does have a way to go from xml to Django, that might be worth exploring tomorrow

2018-02-12 11:02:37	mdkowole	I have the script to extract symptoms from nord. I?ll need to add a second filter but that?s ok. My question is how to put it into Postgres. Do you want a column for each symptom or on blob for each disease(easier)?if it?s a column, I can only give generic labels. They vary with each disease  
2018-02-12 11:03:37	mdkowole	I figured you could search the blob for the key words.  
2018-02-12 11:04:14	mejohn	blob works for django search. Makes graph db a little harder, but django's our focus right now

2018-02-12 11:45:22	mejohn	where'd you pull the info from? a different source? We've combined all of the tabels into one database for production, so it really doesn't matter anymore 
2018-02-12 11:46:53	mdkowole	I haven?t pulled the trigger yet. I?m setting up the script and want to  create a table to send the data to. The source is nord  
2018-02-12 11:47:26	mdkowole	Two columns. Disease and symptoms  
2018-02-12 11:48:15	mdkowole	Will do test of about 20 before I do all 7000

2018-02-12 11:02:37	mdkowole	I have the script to extract symptoms from nord. I?ll need to add a second filter but that?s ok. My question is how to put it into Postgres. Do you want a column for each symptom or on blob for each disease(easier)?if it?s a column, I can only give generic labels. They vary with each disease  
2018-02-12 11:03:37	mdkowole	I figured you could search the blob for the key words.  
2018-02-12 11:04:14	mejohn	blob works for django search. Makes graph db a little harder, but django's our focus right now 
2018-02-12 11:05:03	mdkowole	10-4 
2018-02-12 11:09:02	mejohn	Does the gene_id in allele_gene relate to the mim number in any way? 
2018-02-12 11:32:19	mdkowole	I need to check 
2018-02-12 11:32:44	mdkowole	What database do you want the symptoms table in? 
2018-02-12 11:45:22	mejohn	where'd you pull the info from? a different source? We've combined all of the tabels into one database for production, so it really doesn't matter anymore 
2018-02-12 11:46:53	mdkowole	I haven?t pulled the trigger yet. I?m setting up the script and want to  create a table to send the data to. The source is nord  
2018-02-12 11:47:26	mdkowole	Two columns. Disease and symptoms  
2018-02-12 11:48:15	mdkowole	Will do test of about 20 before I do all 7000 
2018-02-12 11:48:48	mejohn	put it in fda for now, with the orphan drugs 
2018-02-12 11:48:57	mdkowole	Ok  
2018-02-12 12:49:55	msbrown3	Mike, did you ever get the rest of the datafiles from http://orphadata.org (orphadata.org)? 
2018-02-12 12:52:08	mdkowole	No. I focused on getting symptoms from nord. I figured that we had to wait to hear back from orphadata before we did anything. About to harvest symptoms from nord  
2018-02-12 12:58:40	msbrown3	Ok. Let me know when you hear back from them. I wanted to see what they have in those extra datasets, maybe incorporate it on rarediseases.oscar. Looks like it doesn't directly include the symptoms that you're scraping, so it's good you're doing that. 
2018-02-12 13:27:55	mdkowole	I?m close. Just need Megan to fix the Postgres piece. Can?t get the script right regarding writing to dB.  
2018-02-12 13:28:06	mdkowole	I?ll send to you as well 
2018-02-13 12:57:23	mdkowole	The symptoms table is in the fda database. Should be populated by 12:30. I?ve added a pdf to drive that shows how it is used to trigger data collection based on symptoms. It?s referred to as the hpo table in the PDF [:+1:2] 
2018-02-13 13:12:27	mejohn	agensgraph 1.3 doesn't support string matching clauses (LIKE, CONTAINS, etc) so we can build the relationships in sql and then translate to edges, or wait for them to fix it. Was trying to use it for 'if nih grant abstract contains disease name, add edge' 
2018-02-13 13:14:07	mdkowole	I?d go with the former. Figure you make the association and use a verb(or category/relationship) for edge.  
2018-02-13 13:14:29	mejohn	ok 
2018-02-14 08:47:46	mejohn	Any objections to merging our data to one database? I think it's fine to have separate ones for tables that we're still figuring out a schema for, but keeping data separate by source makes it harder to create relationships. 
2018-02-20 08:29:44	msbrown3	@mdkowole, have you heard back from the OrphaData people yet about getting their whole dataset?

2018-02-23 17:29:09		we lost functionality of location searching for hospitals ans specialists (just haven't implemented in new ui) will work on later this weekend unless it's necessary asap 
2018-02-28 09:40:37	mejohn	@Arun @Janne @jesse @Sagar just checking in before the meeting tomorrow, how is associating specialists with their rare diseases going? 
2018-02-28 09:55:53	jesse	Hey Meaghan. It's going okay. I found an issue with the pubmed data containing a lot of duplicates, which I wrote a quick program to resolve. The duplicates were coming in because when we searched for multiple different rare diseases, we would get back the same article. 
2018-02-28 09:55:53		There are a couple other issues as well. When we filtered the pubmed data to only include NC, we got only the pubmed articles which had an author's associated medical school in NC. Contrast this to the specialists data, which was filtered to only include specialists whose hospital was in NC... Many specialists came from another state and now work for a hospital in north carolina and many specialists went to a medical school in NC and left to work at a hospital from another state. 
2018-02-28 09:55:53		So we would only get people who went to a medical school in NC and worked at a hospital in NC, which wouldn't get very many hits with the pubmed data. (but did get hits from Michael Knowles, and a few other physicians.)
2018-02-28 09:55:53		A possible solution would be to get all of the pubmed articles and match that to every specialist in USA. I found a data set that would include all these specialists as well as a few fields we don't have (which would include the hospital they work for and the medical school they went to) (but probably not gps coordinates). 
2018-02-28 10:00:21	mdkowole	Remember they could have done research outside of nc or school outside of nc but are here now 
2018-02-28 10:00:28	msbrown3	If we have the hospital they work at, we can geolocate it to get GPS coordinates or zipcode [:+1:1] 
2018-02-28 10:01:33	mejohn	neat! I'm glad you resolved the issues with pubmed. If it won't take too much more time, I think that your solution sounds like the best way forward that's also future-proof. I'm okay with not having direct gps coordinates right now. We are hoping to have something to show off that we can make the specialists search smart by the meeting next thursday (not tomorrow). Is there anything Michael or I could help with to get that done? 
2018-02-28 10:07:45	jesse	Sagar and I were having trouble comparing the medical school that the physicians went to with the medical school listed under the pubmed article. UNC Chapel Hill School of Medicine would be an easy example, as stripping away the nonsense would just leave Chapel Hill.... But   trying to compare some of the other schools, like North Carolina State University is difficult because there are no unique words in North Carolina State University. 
2018-02-28 10:13:39	jesse	This is the physicians data I have been using: 
2018-02-28 10:13:39		https://data.medicare.gov/Physician-Compare/Physician-Compare-National-Downloadable-File/mj5m-pzi6 
2018-02-28 10:13:39		and as for getting the pubmed data set for all of the united states (probably would contain other countries too), I've been looking here:
2018-02-28 10:13:39		https://www.nlm.nih.gov/databases/download/pubmed_medline.html
2018-02-28 10:13:39		I was going to look for a convenient way of turning the XML stuff into postgres. It provides full sets of the data yearly with daily updates.... if we tried to webscrape all of the pubmed stuff... I'm roughly estimating that would take at least 300 hours... but downloading it directly shouldn't take much time at all.  (edited)
2018-02-28 10:14:23	jesse	That basically sums up what I've been doing/looking into for the week. :slightly_smiling_face: 
2018-02-28 10:15:42	jesse	I got the first link from Thomas' team in 495 class btw. 
2018-02-28 18:21:58	jesse	That 300 hour thing was completely false.... based on the test I just ran, it would take about 22 hours to generate all of the pubmed articles relating to rare diseases using the scraper I made. (i think this will be preferable to downloading all of pubmed... but that is still an option) 
2018-02-28 18:23:00	mejohn	Michael does have a way to go from xml to Django, that might be worth exploring tomorrow 
2018-02-28 18:23:44	jesse	sure. I'll still have the script run in case we want those csv's. [:+1:1]

2018-02-12 11:02:37	mdkowole	I have the script to extract symptoms from nord. I?ll need to add a second filter but that?s ok. My question is how to put it into Postgres. Do you want a column for each symptom or on blob for each disease(easier)?if it?s a column, I can only give generic labels. They vary with each disease  
2018-02-12 11:03:37	mdkowole	I figured you could search the blob for the key words.  
2018-02-12 11:04:14	mejohn	blob works for django search. Makes graph db a little harder, but django's our focus right now 
2018-02-12 11:05:03	mdkowole	10-4 
2018-02-12 11:09:02	mejohn	Does the gene_id in allele_gene relate to the mim number in any way? 
2018-02-12 11:32:19	mdkowole	I need to check 
2018-02-12 11:32:44	mdkowole	What database do you want the symptoms table in? 
2018-02-12 11:45:22	mejohn	where'd you pull the info from? a different source? We've combined all of the tabels into one database for production, so it really doesn't matter anymore 
2018-02-12 11:46:53	mdkowole	I haven?t pulled the trigger yet. I?m setting up the script and want to  create a table to send the data to. The source is nord  
2018-02-12 11:47:26	mdkowole	Two columns. Disease and symptoms  
2018-02-12 11:48:15	mdkowole	Will do test of about 20 before I do all 7000 
2018-02-12 11:48:48	mejohn	put it in fda for now, with the orphan drugs 
2018-02-12 11:48:57	mdkowole	Ok  
2018-02-12 12:49:55	msbrown3	Mike, did you ever get the rest of the datafiles from http://orphadata.org (orphadata.org)? 
2018-02-12 12:52:08	mdkowole	No. I focused on getting symptoms from nord. I figured that we had to wait to hear back from orphadata before we did anything. About to harvest symptoms from nord  
2018-02-12 12:58:40	msbrown3	Ok. Let me know when you hear back from them. I wanted to see what they have in those extra datasets, maybe incorporate it on rarediseases.oscar. Looks like it doesn't directly include the symptoms that you're scraping, so it's good you're doing that. 
2018-02-12 13:27:55	mdkowole	I?m close. Just need Megan to fix the Postgres piece. Can?t get the script right regarding writing to dB.  
2018-02-12 13:28:06	mdkowole	I?ll send to you as well 
2018-02-13 12:57:23	mdkowole	The symptoms table is in the fda database. Should be populated by 12:30. I?ve added a pdf to drive that shows how it is used to trigger data collection based on symptoms. It?s referred to as the hpo table in the PDF [:+1:2] 
2018-02-13 13:12:27	mejohn	agensgraph 1.3 doesn't support string matching clauses (LIKE, CONTAINS, etc) so we can build the relationships in sql and then translate to edges, or wait for them to fix it. Was trying to use it for 'if nih grant abstract contains disease name, add edge' 
2018-02-13 13:14:07	mdkowole	I?d go with the former. Figure you make the association and use a verb(or category/relationship) for edge.  
2018-02-13 13:14:29	mejohn	ok 
2018-02-14 08:47:46	mejohn	Any objections to merging our data to one database? I think it's fine to have separate ones for tables that we're still figuring out a schema for, but keeping data separate by source makes it harder to create relationships. 
2018-02-20 08:29:44	msbrown3	@mdkowole, have you heard back from the OrphaData people yet about getting their whole dataset?

2018-02-23 17:29:09		we lost functionality of location searching for hospitals ans specialists (just haven't implemented in new ui) will work on later this weekend unless it's necessary asap 
2018-02-28 09:40:37	mejohn	@Arun @Janne @jesse @Sagar just checking in before the meeting tomorrow, how is associating specialists with their rare diseases going? 
2018-02-28 09:55:53	jesse	Hey Meaghan. It's going okay. I found an issue with the pubmed data containing a lot of duplicates, which I wrote a quick program to resolve. The duplicates were coming in because when we searched for multiple different rare diseases, we would get back the same article. 
2018-02-28 09:55:53		There are a couple other issues as well. When we filtered the pubmed data to only include NC, we got only the pubmed articles which had an author's associated medical school in NC. Contrast this to the specialists data, which was filtered to only include specialists whose hospital was in NC... Many specialists came from another state and now work for a hospital in north carolina and many specialists went to a medical school in NC and left to work at a hospital from another state. 
2018-02-28 09:55:53		So we would only get people who went to a medical school in NC and worked at a hospital in NC, which wouldn't get very many hits with the pubmed data. (but did get hits from Michael Knowles, and a few other physicians.)
2018-02-28 09:55:53		A possible solution would be to get all of the pubmed articles and match that to every specialist in USA. I found a data set that would include all these specialists as well as a few fields we don't have (which would include the hospital they work for and the medical school they went to) (but probably not gps coordinates). 
2018-02-28 10:00:21	mdkowole	Remember they could have done research outside of nc or school outside of nc but are here now 
2018-02-28 10:00:28	msbrown3	If we have the hospital they work at, we can geolocate it to get GPS coordinates or zipcode [:+1:1] 
2018-02-28 10:01:33	mejohn	neat! I'm glad you resolved the issues with pubmed. If it won't take too much more time, I think that your solution sounds like the best way forward that's also future-proof. I'm okay with not having direct gps coordinates right now. We are hoping to have something to show off that we can make the specialists search smart by the meeting next thursday (not tomorrow). Is there anything Michael or I could help with to get that done? 
2018-02-28 10:07:45	jesse	Sagar and I were having trouble comparing the medical school that the physicians went to with the medical school listed under the pubmed article. UNC Chapel Hill School of Medicine would be an easy example, as stripping away the nonsense would just leave Chapel Hill.... But   trying to compare some of the other schools, like North Carolina State University is difficult because there are no unique words in North Carolina State University. 
2018-02-28 10:13:39	jesse	This is the physicians data I have been using: 
2018-02-28 10:13:39		https://data.medicare.gov/Physician-Compare/Physician-Compare-National-Downloadable-File/mj5m-pzi6 
2018-02-28 10:13:39		and as for getting the pubmed data set for all of the united states (probably would contain other countries too), I've been looking here:
2018-02-28 10:13:39		https://www.nlm.nih.gov/databases/download/pubmed_medline.html
2018-02-28 10:13:39		I was going to look for a convenient way of turning the XML stuff into postgres. It provides full sets of the data yearly with daily updates.... if we tried to webscrape all of the pubmed stuff... I'm roughly estimating that would take at least 300 hours... but downloading it directly shouldn't take much time at all.  (edited)
2018-02-28 10:14:23	jesse	That basically sums up what I've been doing/looking into for the week. :slightly_smiling_face: 
2018-02-28 10:15:42	jesse	I got the first link from Thomas' team in 495 class btw. 
2018-02-28 18:21:58	jesse	That 300 hour thing was completely false.... based on the test I just ran, it would take about 22 hours to generate all of the pubmed articles relating to rare diseases using the scraper I made. (i think this will be preferable to downloading all of pubmed... but that is still an option) 
2018-02-28 18:23:00	mejohn	Michael does have a way to go from xml to Django, that might be worth exploring tomorrow 
2018-02-28 18:23:44	jesse	sure. I'll still have the script run in case we want those csv's. [:+1:1]

2018-04-10 09:22:30	mejohn	ok awesome! we can put it up there with a full text search for the disease name for this week, if you think it'll take a while to get the orpha ids in

2018-04-10 09:25:34		 but it shouldnt be too hard to get the disease id. The disease names should follow the same format as the orpha stuff so I dont think youll need to worry about Ngrams or anything.

2018-04-10 15:10:47	msbrown3	Hey everyone. Our codebase now uses PostGIS for geospacial locations. If you're running postgres, you'll need to install the PostGIS extension to Postgres. You'll have to change settings.py to use PostGIS also. Instructions:
2018-04-10 15:10:47		Install PostGIS:
2018-04-10 15:10:47		    # yum install https://download.postgresql.org/pub/repos/yum/9.6/redhat/rhel-7-x86_64/pgdg-centos96-9.6-3.noarch.rpm
2018-04-10 15:10:47		    # yum install postgresql96 postgresql96-server postgresql96-devel postgis24_96
2018-04-10 15:10:47		Activate PostGIS extension:
2018-04-10 15:10:47		    $ python manage.py dbshell --database data
2018-04-10 15:10:47		    rd_data=# CREATE EXTENSION postGIS;
2018-04-10 15:10:47		In `project/settings.py`, update the database engine to use PostGIS:
2018-04-10 15:10:47		    'ENGINE': 'django.contrib.gis.db.backends.postgis',
2018-04-10 15:10:47		As usual, on database schema changes, you'll need to migrate:
2018-04-10 15:10:47		    $ python manage.py makemigrations
2018-04-10 15:10:47		    $ python manage.py migrate

2018-02-12 11:02:37	mdkowole	I have the script to extract symptoms from nord. I?ll need to add a second filter but that?s ok. My question is how to put it into Postgres. Do you want a column for each symptom or on blob for each disease(easier)?if it?s a column, I can only give generic labels. They vary with each disease  
2018-02-12 11:03:37	mdkowole	I figured you could search the blob for the key words.  
2018-02-12 11:04:14	mejohn	blob works for django search. Makes graph db a little harder, but django's our focus right now 
2018-02-12 11:05:03	mdkowole	10-4 
2018-02-12 11:09:02	mejohn	Does the gene_id in allele_gene relate to the mim number in any way? 
2018-02-12 11:32:19	mdkowole	I need to check 
2018-02-12 11:32:44	mdkowole	What database do you want the symptoms table in? 
2018-02-12 11:45:22	mejohn	where'd you pull the info from? a different source? We've combined all of the tabels into one database for production, so it really doesn't matter anymore 
2018-02-12 11:46:53	mdkowole	I haven?t pulled the trigger yet. I?m setting up the script and want to  create a table to send the data to. The source is nord  
2018-02-12 11:47:26	mdkowole	Two columns. Disease and symptoms  
2018-02-12 11:48:15	mdkowole	Will do test of about 20 before I do all 7000 
2018-02-12 11:48:48	mejohn	put it in fda for now, with the orphan drugs 
2018-02-12 11:48:57	mdkowole	Ok  
2018-02-12 12:49:55	msbrown3	Mike, did you ever get the rest of the datafiles from http://orphadata.org (orphadata.org)? 
2018-02-12 12:52:08	mdkowole	No. I focused on getting symptoms from nord. I figured that we had to wait to hear back from orphadata before we did anything. About to harvest symptoms from nord  
2018-02-12 12:58:40	msbrown3	Ok. Let me know when you hear back from them. I wanted to see what they have in those extra datasets, maybe incorporate it on rarediseases.oscar. Looks like it doesn't directly include the symptoms that you're scraping, so it's good you're doing that. 
2018-02-12 13:27:55	mdkowole	I?m close. Just need Megan to fix the Postgres piece. Can?t get the script right regarding writing to dB.  
2018-02-12 13:28:06	mdkowole	I?ll send to you as well 
2018-02-13 12:57:23	mdkowole	The symptoms table is in the fda database. Should be populated by 12:30. I?ve added a pdf to drive that shows how it is used to trigger data collection based on symptoms. It?s referred to as the hpo table in the PDF [:+1:2] 
2018-02-13 13:12:27	mejohn	agensgraph 1.3 doesn't support string matching clauses (LIKE, CONTAINS, etc) so we can build the relationships in sql and then translate to edges, or wait for them to fix it. Was trying to use it for 'if nih grant abstract contains disease name, add edge' 
2018-02-13 13:14:07	mdkowole	I?d go with the former. Figure you make the association and use a verb(or category/relationship) for edge.  
2018-02-13 13:14:29	mejohn	ok 
2018-02-14 08:47:46	mejohn	Any objections to merging our data to one database? I think it's fine to have separate ones for tables that we're still figuring out a schema for, but keeping data separate by source makes it harder to create relationships. 
2018-02-20 08:29:44	msbrown3	@mdkowole, have you heard back from the OrphaData people yet about getting their whole dataset?

2018-02-23 17:29:09		we lost functionality of location searching for hospitals ans specialists (just haven't implemented in new ui) will work on later this weekend unless it's necessary asap 
2018-02-28 09:40:37	mejohn	@Arun @Janne @jesse @Sagar just checking in before the meeting tomorrow, how is associating specialists with their rare diseases going? 
2018-02-28 09:55:53	jesse	Hey Meaghan. It's going okay. I found an issue with the pubmed data containing a lot of duplicates, which I wrote a quick program to resolve. The duplicates were coming in because when we searched for multiple different rare diseases, we would get back the same article. 
2018-02-28 09:55:53		There are a couple other issues as well. When we filtered the pubmed data to only include NC, we got only the pubmed articles which had an author's associated medical school in NC. Contrast this to the specialists data, which was filtered to only include specialists whose hospital was in NC... Many specialists came from another state and now work for a hospital in north carolina and many specialists went to a medical school in NC and left to work at a hospital from another state. 
2018-02-28 09:55:53		So we would only get people who went to a medical school in NC and worked at a hospital in NC, which wouldn't get very many hits with the pubmed data. (but did get hits from Michael Knowles, and a few other physicians.)
2018-02-28 09:55:53		A possible solution would be to get all of the pubmed articles and match that to every specialist in USA. I found a data set that would include all these specialists as well as a few fields we don't have (which would include the hospital they work for and the medical school they went to) (but probably not gps coordinates). 
2018-02-28 10:00:21	mdkowole	Remember they could have done research outside of nc or school outside of nc but are here now 
2018-02-28 10:00:28	msbrown3	If we have the hospital they work at, we can geolocate it to get GPS coordinates or zipcode [:+1:1] 
2018-02-28 10:01:33	mejohn	neat! I'm glad you resolved the issues with pubmed. If it won't take too much more time, I think that your solution sounds like the best way forward that's also future-proof. I'm okay with not having direct gps coordinates right now. We are hoping to have something to show off that we can make the specialists search smart by the meeting next thursday (not tomorrow). Is there anything Michael or I could help with to get that done? 
2018-02-28 10:07:45	jesse	Sagar and I were having trouble comparing the medical school that the physicians went to with the medical school listed under the pubmed article. UNC Chapel Hill School of Medicine would be an easy example, as stripping away the nonsense would just leave Chapel Hill.... But   trying to compare some of the other schools, like North Carolina State University is difficult because there are no unique words in North Carolina State University. 
2018-02-28 10:13:39	jesse	This is the physicians data I have been using: 
2018-02-28 10:13:39		https://data.medicare.gov/Physician-Compare/Physician-Compare-National-Downloadable-File/mj5m-pzi6 
2018-02-28 10:13:39		and as for getting the pubmed data set for all of the united states (probably would contain other countries too), I've been looking here:
2018-02-28 10:13:39		https://www.nlm.nih.gov/databases/download/pubmed_medline.html
2018-02-28 10:13:39		I was going to look for a convenient way of turning the XML stuff into postgres. It provides full sets of the data yearly with daily updates.... if we tried to webscrape all of the pubmed stuff... I'm roughly estimating that would take at least 300 hours... but downloading it directly shouldn't take much time at all.  (edited)
2018-02-28 10:14:23	jesse	That basically sums up what I've been doing/looking into for the week. :slightly_smiling_face: 
2018-02-28 10:15:42	jesse	I got the first link from Thomas' team in 495 class btw. 
2018-02-28 18:21:58	jesse	That 300 hour thing was completely false.... based on the test I just ran, it would take about 22 hours to generate all of the pubmed articles relating to rare diseases using the scraper I made. (i think this will be preferable to downloading all of pubmed... but that is still an option) 
2018-02-28 18:23:00	mejohn	Michael does have a way to go from xml to Django, that might be worth exploring tomorrow 
2018-02-28 18:23:44	jesse	sure. I'll still have the script run in case we want those csv's. [:+1:1]

2018-04-10 09:17:41	jesse	it doesnt have an orpha id though. 
2018-04-10 09:22:30	mejohn	ok awesome! we can put it up there with a full text search for the disease name for this week, if you think it'll take a while to get the orpha ids in 
2018-04-10 09:25:34	jesse	I'm pretty backed up on school work, so I wont be able to work on that part.
2018-04-10 09:25:34		 but it shouldnt be too hard to get the disease id. The disease names should follow the same format as the orpha stuff so I dont think youll need to worry about Ngrams or anything.

2018-04-10 15:10:47	msbrown3	Hey everyone. Our codebase now uses PostGIS for geospacial locations. If you're running postgres, you'll need to install the PostGIS extension to Postgres. You'll have to change settings.py to use PostGIS also. Instructions:
2018-04-10 15:10:47		Install PostGIS:
2018-04-10 15:10:47		    # yum install https://download.postgresql.org/pub/repos/yum/9.6/redhat/rhel-7-x86_64/pgdg-centos96-9.6-3.noarch.rpm
2018-04-10 15:10:47		    # yum install postgresql96 postgresql96-server postgresql96-devel postgis24_96
2018-04-10 15:10:47		Activate PostGIS extension:
2018-04-10 15:10:47		    $ python manage.py dbshell --database data
2018-04-10 15:10:47		    rd_data=# CREATE EXTENSION postGIS;
2018-04-10 15:10:47		In `project/settings.py`, update the database engine to use PostGIS:
2018-04-10 15:10:47		    'ENGINE': 'django.contrib.gis.db.backends.postgis',
2018-04-10 15:10:47		As usual, on database schema changes, you'll need to migrate:
2018-04-10 15:10:47		    $ python manage.py makemigrations
2018-04-10 15:10:47		    $ python manage.py migrate
2018-04-10 15:10:47		    $ python manage.py migrate --database data

2018-02-12 11:02:37	mdkowole	I have the script to extract symptoms from nord. I?ll need to add a second filter but that?s ok. My question is how to put it into Postgres. Do you want a column for each symptom or on blob for each disease(easier)?if it?s a column, I can only give generic labels. They vary with each disease  
2018-02-12 11:03:37	mdkowole	I figured you could search the blob for the key words.  
2018-02-12 11:04:14	mejohn	blob works for django search. Makes graph db a little harder, but django's our focus right now 
2018-02-12 11:05:03	mdkowole	10-4 
2018-02-12 11:09:02	mejohn	Does the gene_id in allele_gene relate to the mim number in any way? 
2018-02-12 11:32:19	mdkowole	I need to check 
2018-02-12 11:32:44	mdkowole	What database do you want the symptoms table in? 
2018-02-12 11:45:22	mejohn	where'd you pull the info from? a different source? We've combined all of the tabels into one database for production, so it really doesn't matter anymore 
2018-02-12 11:46:53	mdkowole	I haven?t pulled the trigger yet. I?m setting up the script and want to  create a table to send the data to. The source is nord  
2018-02-12 11:47:26	mdkowole	Two columns. Disease and symptoms  
2018-02-12 11:48:15	mdkowole	Will do test of about 20 before I do all 7000 
2018-02-12 11:48:48	mejohn	put it in fda for now, with the orphan drugs 
2018-02-12 11:48:57	mdkowole	Ok  
2018-02-12 12:49:55	msbrown3	Mike, did you ever get the rest of the datafiles from http://orphadata.org (orphadata.org)? 
2018-02-12 12:52:08	mdkowole	No. I focused on getting symptoms from nord. I figured that we had to wait to hear back from orphadata before we did anything. About to harvest symptoms from nord  
2018-02-12 12:58:40	msbrown3	Ok. Let me know when you hear back from them. I wanted to see what they have in those extra datasets, maybe incorporate it on rarediseases.oscar. Looks like it doesn't directly include the symptoms that you're scraping, so it's good you're doing that. 
2018-02-12 13:27:55	mdkowole	I?m close. Just need Megan to fix the Postgres piece. Can?t get the script right regarding writing to dB.  
2018-02-12 13:28:06	mdkowole	I?ll send to you as well 
2018-02-13 12:57:23	mdkowole	The symptoms table is in the fda database. Should be populated by 12:30. I?ve added a pdf to drive that shows how it is used to trigger data collection based on symptoms. It?s referred to as the hpo table in the PDF [:+1:2] 
2018-02-13 13:12:27	mejohn	agensgraph 1.3 doesn't support string matching clauses (LIKE, CONTAINS, etc) so we can build the relationships in sql and then translate to edges, or wait for them to fix it. Was trying to use it for 'if nih grant abstract contains disease name, add edge' 
2018-02-13 13:14:07	mdkowole	I?d go with the former. Figure you make the association and use a verb(or category/relationship) for edge.  
2018-02-13 13:14:29	mejohn	ok 
2018-02-14 08:47:46	mejohn	Any objections to merging our data to one database? I think it's fine to have separate ones for tables that we're still figuring out a schema for, but keeping data separate by source makes it harder to create relationships. 
2018-02-20 08:29:44	msbrown3	@mdkowole, have you heard back from the OrphaData people yet about getting their whole dataset?

2018-02-23 17:29:09	mejohn	updates and start of new ui pushed to https://rarediseases.oscar.ncsu.edu @mdkowole 
2018-02-23 17:29:09		we lost functionality of location searching for hospitals ans specialists (just haven't implemented in new ui) will work on later this weekend unless it's necessary asap 
2018-02-28 09:40:37	mejohn	@Arun @Janne @jesse @Sagar just checking in before the meeting tomorrow, how is associating specialists with their rare diseases going? 
2018-02-28 09:55:53	jesse	Hey Meaghan. It's going okay. I found an issue with the pubmed data containing a lot of duplicates, which I wrote a quick program to resolve. The duplicates were coming in because when we searched for multiple different rare diseases, we would get back the same article. 
2018-02-28 09:55:53		There are a couple other issues as well. When we filtered the pubmed data to only include NC, we got only the pubmed articles which had an author's associated medical school in NC. Contrast this to the specialists data, which was filtered to only include specialists whose hospital was in NC... Many specialists came from another state and now work for a hospital in north carolina and many specialists went to a medical school in NC and left to work at a hospital from another state. 
2018-02-28 09:55:53		So we would only get people who went to a medical school in NC and worked at a hospital in NC, which wouldn't get very many hits with the pubmed data. (but did get hits from Michael Knowles, and a few other physicians.)
2018-02-28 09:55:53		A possible solution would be to get all of the pubmed articles and match that to every specialist in USA. I found a data set that would include all these specialists as well as a few fields we don't have (which would include the hospital they work for and the medical school they went to) (but probably not gps coordinates). 
2018-02-28 10:00:21	mdkowole	Remember they could have done research outside of nc or school outside of nc but are here now 
2018-02-28 10:00:28	msbrown3	If we have the hospital they work at, we can geolocate it to get GPS coordinates or zipcode [:+1:1] 
2018-02-28 10:01:33	mejohn	neat! I'm glad you resolved the issues with pubmed. If it won't take too much more time, I think that your solution sounds like the best way forward that's also future-proof. I'm okay with not having direct gps coordinates right now. We are hoping to have something to show off that we can make the specialists search smart by the meeting next thursday (not tomorrow). Is there anything Michael or I could help with to get that done? 
2018-02-28 10:07:45	jesse	Sagar and I were having trouble comparing the medical school that the physicians went to with the medical school listed under the pubmed article. UNC Chapel Hill School of Medicine would be an easy example, as stripping away the nonsense would just leave Chapel Hill.... But   trying to compare some of the other schools, like North Carolina State University is difficult because there are no unique words in North Carolina State University. 
2018-02-28 10:13:39	jesse	This is the physicians data I have been using: 
2018-02-28 10:13:39		https://data.medicare.gov/Physician-Compare/Physician-Compare-National-Downloadable-File/mj5m-pzi6 
2018-02-28 10:13:39		and as for getting the pubmed data set for all of the united states (probably would contain other countries too), I've been looking here:
2018-02-28 10:13:39		https://www.nlm.nih.gov/databases/download/pubmed_medline.html
2018-02-28 10:13:39		I was going to look for a convenient way of turning the XML stuff into postgres. It provides full sets of the data yearly with daily updates.... if we tried to webscrape all of the pubmed stuff... I'm roughly estimating that would take at least 300 hours... but downloading it directly shouldn't take much time at all.  (edited)
2018-02-28 10:14:23	jesse	That basically sums up what I've been doing/looking into for the week. :slightly_smiling_face: 
2018-02-28 10:15:42	jesse	I got the first link from Thomas' team in 495 class btw. 
2018-02-28 18:21:58	jesse	That 300 hour thing was completely false.... based on the test I just ran, it would take about 22 hours to generate all of the pubmed articles relating to rare diseases using the scraper I made. (i think this will be preferable to downloading all of pubmed... but that is still an option) 
2018-02-28 18:23:00	mejohn	Michael does have a way to go from xml to Django, that might be worth exploring tomorrow 
2018-02-28 18:23:44	jesse	sure. I'll still have the script run in case we want those csv's. [:+1:1]

2018-03-19 16:11:12	mdkowole	The specialist stuff is still questionable on the development site. Can someone send me the logic flow? 
2018-03-19 16:49:56	jesse	The specialists in general were just obtained through http://medicare.gov (medicare.gov) .

2018-04-10 09:16:58	jesse	ive got nord_support_groups and nih_support_groups in a table on pubmed jesse. theyre just what youd see if you went to the support groups part of the nord or rarediseases nih pages. 
2018-04-10 09:17:41	jesse	it doesnt have an orpha id though. 
2018-04-10 09:22:30	mejohn	ok awesome! we can put it up there with a full text search for the disease name for this week, if you think it'll take a while to get the orpha ids in 
2018-04-10 09:25:34	jesse	I'm pretty backed up on school work, so I wont be able to work on that part.
2018-04-10 09:25:34		 but it shouldnt be too hard to get the disease id. The disease names should follow the same format as the orpha stuff so I dont think youll need to worry about Ngrams or anything. 
2018-04-10 09:26:18	mejohn	sweet, I'll grab it now. Thanks for letting me know you're busy, we'll get it working :slightly_smiling_face: 
2018-04-10 09:26:30	jesse	Thanks! 
2018-04-10 15:10:47	msbrown3	Hey everyone. Our codebase now uses PostGIS for geospacial locations. If you're running postgres, you'll need to install the PostGIS extension to Postgres. You'll have to change settings.py to use PostGIS also. Instructions:
2018-04-10 15:10:47		Install PostGIS:
2018-04-10 15:10:47		    # yum install https://download.postgresql.org/pub/repos/yum/9.6/redhat/rhel-7-x86_64/pgdg-centos96-9.6-3.noarch.rpm
2018-04-10 15:10:47		    # yum install postgresql96 postgresql96-server postgresql96-devel postgis24_96
2018-04-10 15:10:47		Activate PostGIS extension:
2018-04-10 15:10:47		    $ python manage.py dbshell --database data
2018-04-10 15:10:47		    rd_data=# CREATE EXTENSION postGIS;
2018-04-10 15:10:47		In `project/settings.py`, update the database engine to use PostGIS:
2018-04-10 15:10:47		    'ENGINE': 'django.contrib.gis.db.backends.postgis',
2018-04-10 15:10:47		As usual, on database schema changes, you'll need to migrate:
2018-04-10 15:10:47		    $ python manage.py makemigrations
2018-04-10 15:10:47		    $ python manage.py migrate
2018-04-10 15:10:47		    $ python manage.py migrate --database data

2018-02-12 11:03:37	mdkowole	I figured you could search the blob for the key words.  
2018-02-12 11:04:14	mejohn	blob works for django search. Makes graph db a little harder, but django's our focus right now 
2018-02-12 11:05:03	mdkowole	10-4 
2018-02-12 11:09:02	mejohn	Does the gene_id in allele_gene relate to the mim number in any way? 
2018-02-12 11:32:19	mdkowole	I need to check 
2018-02-12 11:32:44	mdkowole	What database do you want the symptoms table in? 
2018-02-12 11:45:22	mejohn	where'd you pull the info from? a different source? We've combined all of the tabels into one database for production, so it really doesn't matter anymore 
2018-02-12 11:46:53	mdkowole	I haven’t pulled the trigger yet. I’m setting up the script and want to  create a table to send the data to. The source is nord  
2018-02-12 11:47:26	mdkowole	Two columns. Disease and symptoms  
2018-02-12 11:48:15	mdkowole	Will do test of about 20 before I do all 7000 
2018-02-12 11:48:48	mejohn	put it in fda for now, with the orphan drugs 
2018-02-12 11:48:57	mdkowole	Ok  
2018-02-12 12:49:55	msbrown3	Mike, did you ever get the rest of the datafiles from http://orphadata.org (orphadata.org)? 
2018-02-12 12:52:08	mdkowole	No. I focused on getting symptoms from nord. I figured that we had to wait to hear back from orphadata before we did anything. About to harvest symptoms from nord  
2018-02-12 12:58:40	msbrown3	Ok. Let me know when you hear back from them. I wanted to see what they have in those extra datasets, maybe incorporate it on rarediseases.oscar. Looks like it doesn't directly include the symptoms that you're scraping, so it's good you're doing that. 
2018-02-12 13:27:55	mdkowole	I’m close. Just need Megan to fix the Postgres piece. Can’t get the script right regarding writing to dB.  
2018-02-12 13:28:06	mdkowole	I’ll send to you as well 
2018-02-13 12:57:23	mdkowole	The symptoms table is in the fda database. Should be populated by 12:30. I’ve added a pdf to drive that shows how it is used to trigger data collection based on symptoms. It’s referred to as the hpo table in the PDF [:+1:2] 
2018-02-13 13:12:27	mejohn	agensgraph 1.3 doesn't support string matching clauses (LIKE, CONTAINS, etc) so we can build the relationships in sql and then translate to edges, or wait for them to fix it. Was trying to use it for 'if nih grant abstract contains disease name, add edge' 
2018-02-13 13:14:07	mdkowole	I’d go with the former. Figure you make the association and use a verb(or category/relationship) for edge.  
2018-02-13 13:14:29	mejohn	ok 
2018-02-14 08:47:46	mejohn	Any objections to merging our data to one database? I think it's fine to have separate ones for tables that we're still figuring out a schema for, but keeping data separate by source makes it harder to create relationships. 
2018-02-20 08:29:44	msbrown3	@mdkowole, have you heard back from the OrphaData people yet about getting their whole dataset?

2018-02-23 17:29:09		we lost functionality of location searching for hospitals ans specialists (just haven't implemented in new ui) will work on later this weekend unless it's necessary asap 
2018-02-28 09:40:37	mejohn	@Arun @Janne @jesse @Sagar just checking in before the meeting tomorrow, how is associating specialists with their rare diseases going? 
2018-02-28 09:55:53	jesse	Hey Meaghan. It's going okay. I found an issue with the pubmed data containing a lot of duplicates, which I wrote a quick program to resolve. The duplicates were coming in because when we searched for multiple different rare diseases, we would get back the same article. 
2018-02-28 09:55:53		There are a couple other issues as well. When we filtered the pubmed data to only include NC, we got only the pubmed articles which had an author's associated medical school in NC. Contrast this to the specialists data, which was filtered to only include specialists whose hospital was in NC... Many specialists came from another state and now work for a hospital in north carolina and many specialists went to a medical school in NC and left to work at a hospital from another state. 
2018-02-28 09:55:53		So we would only get people who went to a medical school in NC and worked at a hospital in NC, which wouldn't get very many hits with the pubmed data. (but did get hits from Michael Knowles, and a few other physicians.)
2018-02-28 09:55:53		A possible solution would be to get all of the pubmed articles and match that to every specialist in USA. I found a data set that would include all these specialists as well as a few fields we don't have (which would include the hospital they work for and the medical school they went to) (but probably not gps coordinates). 
2018-02-28 10:00:21	mdkowole	Remember they could have done research outside of nc or school outside of nc but are here now 
2018-02-28 10:00:28	msbrown3	If we have the hospital they work at, we can geolocate it to get GPS coordinates or zipcode [:+1:1] 
2018-02-28 10:01:33	mejohn	neat! I'm glad you resolved the issues with pubmed. If it won't take too much more time, I think that your solution sounds like the best way forward that's also future-proof. I'm okay with not having direct gps coordinates right now. We are hoping to have something to show off that we can make the specialists search smart by the meeting next thursday (not tomorrow). Is there anything Michael or I could help with to get that done? 
2018-02-28 10:07:45	jesse	Sagar and I were having trouble comparing the medical school that the physicians went to with the medical school listed under the pubmed article. UNC Chapel Hill School of Medicine would be an easy example, as stripping away the nonsense would just leave Chapel Hill.... But   trying to compare some of the other schools, like North Carolina State University is difficult because there are no unique words in North Carolina State University. 
2018-02-28 10:13:39	jesse	This is the physicians data I have been using: 
2018-02-28 10:13:39		https://data.medicare.gov/Physician-Compare/Physician-Compare-National-Downloadable-File/mj5m-pzi6 
2018-02-28 10:13:39		and as for getting the pubmed data set for all of the united states (probably would contain other countries too), I've been looking here:
2018-02-28 10:13:39		https://www.nlm.nih.gov/databases/download/pubmed_medline.html
2018-02-28 10:13:39		I was going to look for a convenient way of turning the XML stuff into postgres. It provides full sets of the data yearly with daily updates.... if we tried to webscrape all of the pubmed stuff... I'm roughly estimating that would take at least 300 hours... but downloading it directly shouldn't take much time at all.  (edited)
2018-02-28 10:14:23	jesse	That basically sums up what I've been doing/looking into for the week. :slightly_smiling_face: 
2018-02-28 10:15:42	jesse	I got the first link from Thomas' team in 495 class btw. 
2018-02-28 18:21:58	jesse	That 300 hour thing was completely false.... based on the test I just ran, it would take about 22 hours to generate all of the pubmed articles relating to rare diseases using the scraper I made. (i think this will be preferable to downloading all of pubmed... but that is still an option) 
2018-02-28 18:23:00	mejohn	Michael does have a way to go from xml to Django, that might be worth exploring tomorrow 
2018-02-28 18:23:44	jesse	sure. I'll still have the script run in case we want those csv's. [:+1:1]

2018-04-10 09:17:41	jesse	it doesnt have an orpha id though. 
2018-04-10 09:22:30	mejohn	ok awesome! we can put it up there with a full text search for the disease name for this week, if you think it'll take a while to get the orpha ids in

2018-04-10 09:25:34		 but it shouldnt be too hard to get the disease id. The disease names should follow the same format as the orpha stuff so I dont think youll need to worry about Ngrams or anything.

2018-04-10 15:10:47	msbrown3	Hey everyone. Our codebase now uses PostGIS for geospacial locations. If you're running postgres, you'll need to install the PostGIS extension to Postgres. You'll have to change settings.py to use PostGIS also. Instructions:
2018-04-10 15:10:47		Install PostGIS:
2018-04-10 15:10:47		    # yum install https://download.postgresql.org/pub/repos/yum/9.6/redhat/rhel-7-x86_64/pgdg-centos96-9.6-3.noarch.rpm
2018-04-10 15:10:47		    # yum install postgresql96 postgresql96-server postgresql96-devel postgis24_96
2018-04-10 15:10:47		Activate PostGIS extension:
2018-04-10 15:10:47		    $ python manage.py dbshell --database data
2018-04-10 15:10:47		    rd_data=# CREATE EXTENSION postGIS;
2018-04-10 15:10:47		In `project/settings.py`, update the database engine to use PostGIS:
2018-04-10 15:10:47		    'ENGINE': 'django.contrib.gis.db.backends.postgis',
2018-04-10 15:10:47		As usual, on database schema changes, you'll need to migrate:
2018-04-10 15:10:47		    $ python manage.py makemigrations
2018-04-10 15:10:47		    $ python manage.py migrate
2018-04-10 15:10:47		    $ python manage.py migrate --database data

2018-02-12 11:46:53	mdkowole	I haven’t pulled the trigger yet. I’m setting up the script and want to  create a table to send the data to. The source is nord  
2018-02-12 11:47:26	mdkowole	Two columns. Disease and symptoms  
2018-02-12 11:48:15	mdkowole	Will do test of about 20 before I do all 7000 
2018-02-12 11:48:48	mejohn	put it in fda for now, with the orphan drugs 
2018-02-12 11:48:57	mdkowole	Ok  
2018-02-12 12:49:55	msbrown3	Mike, did you ever get the rest of the datafiles from http://orphadata.org (orphadata.org)? 
2018-02-12 12:52:08	mdkowole	No. I focused on getting symptoms from nord. I figured that we had to wait to hear back from orphadata before we did anything. About to harvest symptoms from nord  
2018-02-12 12:58:40	msbrown3	Ok. Let me know when you hear back from them. I wanted to see what they have in those extra datasets, maybe incorporate it on rarediseases.oscar. Looks like it doesn't directly include the symptoms that you're scraping, so it's good you're doing that. 
2018-02-12 13:27:55	mdkowole	I’m close. Just need Megan to fix the Postgres piece. Can’t get the script right regarding writing to dB.  
2018-02-12 13:28:06	mdkowole	I’ll send to you as well 
2018-02-13 12:57:23	mdkowole	The symptoms table is in the fda database. Should be populated by 12:30. I’ve added a pdf to drive that shows how it is used to trigger data collection based on symptoms. It’s referred to as the hpo table in the PDF [:+1:2] 
2018-02-13 13:12:27	mejohn	agensgraph 1.3 doesn't support string matching clauses (LIKE, CONTAINS, etc) so we can build the relationships in sql and then translate to edges, or wait for them to fix it. Was trying to use it for 'if nih grant abstract contains disease name, add edge' 
2018-02-13 13:14:07	mdkowole	I’d go with the former. Figure you make the association and use a verb(or category/relationship) for edge.  
2018-02-13 13:14:29	mejohn	ok 
2018-02-14 08:47:46	mejohn	Any objections to merging our data to one database? I think it's fine to have separate ones for tables that we're still figuring out a schema for, but keeping data separate by source makes it harder to create relationships. 
2018-02-20 08:29:44	msbrown3	@mdkowole, have you heard back from the OrphaData people yet about getting their whole dataset?

2018-02-23 17:29:09		we lost functionality of location searching for hospitals ans specialists (just haven't implemented in new ui) will work on later this weekend unless it's necessary asap 
2018-02-28 09:40:37	mejohn	@Arun @Janne @jesse @Sagar just checking in before the meeting tomorrow, how is associating specialists with their rare diseases going? 
2018-02-28 09:55:53	jesse	Hey Meaghan. It's going okay. I found an issue with the pubmed data containing a lot of duplicates, which I wrote a quick program to resolve. The duplicates were coming in because when we searched for multiple different rare diseases, we would get back the same article. 
2018-02-28 09:55:53		There are a couple other issues as well. When we filtered the pubmed data to only include NC, we got only the pubmed articles which had an author's associated medical school in NC. Contrast this to the specialists data, which was filtered to only include specialists whose hospital was in NC... Many specialists came from another state and now work for a hospital in north carolina and many specialists went to a medical school in NC and left to work at a hospital from another state. 
2018-02-28 09:55:53		So we would only get people who went to a medical school in NC and worked at a hospital in NC, which wouldn't get very many hits with the pubmed data. (but did get hits from Michael Knowles, and a few other physicians.)
2018-02-28 09:55:53		A possible solution would be to get all of the pubmed articles and match that to every specialist in USA. I found a data set that would include all these specialists as well as a few fields we don't have (which would include the hospital they work for and the medical school they went to) (but probably not gps coordinates). 
2018-02-28 10:00:21	mdkowole	Remember they could have done research outside of nc or school outside of nc but are here now 
2018-02-28 10:00:28	msbrown3	If we have the hospital they work at, we can geolocate it to get GPS coordinates or zipcode [:+1:1] 
2018-02-28 10:01:33	mejohn	neat! I'm glad you resolved the issues with pubmed. If it won't take too much more time, I think that your solution sounds like the best way forward that's also future-proof. I'm okay with not having direct gps coordinates right now. We are hoping to have something to show off that we can make the specialists search smart by the meeting next thursday (not tomorrow). Is there anything Michael or I could help with to get that done? 
2018-02-28 10:07:45	jesse	Sagar and I were having trouble comparing the medical school that the physicians went to with the medical school listed under the pubmed article. UNC Chapel Hill School of Medicine would be an easy example, as stripping away the nonsense would just leave Chapel Hill.... But   trying to compare some of the other schools, like North Carolina State University is difficult because there are no unique words in North Carolina State University. 
2018-02-28 10:13:39	jesse	This is the physicians data I have been using: 
2018-02-28 10:13:39		https://data.medicare.gov/Physician-Compare/Physician-Compare-National-Downloadable-File/mj5m-pzi6 
2018-02-28 10:13:39		and as for getting the pubmed data set for all of the united states (probably would contain other countries too), I've been looking here:
2018-02-28 10:13:39		https://www.nlm.nih.gov/databases/download/pubmed_medline.html
2018-02-28 10:13:39		I was going to look for a convenient way of turning the XML stuff into postgres. It provides full sets of the data yearly with daily updates.... if we tried to webscrape all of the pubmed stuff... I'm roughly estimating that would take at least 300 hours... but downloading it directly shouldn't take much time at all.  (edited)
2018-02-28 10:14:23	jesse	That basically sums up what I've been doing/looking into for the week. :slightly_smiling_face: 
2018-02-28 10:15:42	jesse	I got the first link from Thomas' team in 495 class btw. 
2018-02-28 18:21:58	jesse	That 300 hour thing was completely false.... based on the test I just ran, it would take about 22 hours to generate all of the pubmed articles relating to rare diseases using the scraper I made. (i think this will be preferable to downloading all of pubmed... but that is still an option) 
2018-02-28 18:23:00	mejohn	Michael does have a way to go from xml to Django, that might be worth exploring tomorrow 
2018-02-28 18:23:44	jesse	sure. I'll still have the script run in case we want those csv's. [:+1:1]

2018-04-10 09:17:41	jesse	it doesnt have an orpha id though. 
2018-04-10 09:22:30	mejohn	ok awesome! we can put it up there with a full text search for the disease name for this week, if you think it'll take a while to get the orpha ids in 
2018-04-10 09:25:34	jesse	I'm pretty backed up on school work, so I wont be able to work on that part.
2018-04-10 09:25:34		 but it shouldnt be too hard to get the disease id. The disease names should follow the same format as the orpha stuff so I dont think youll need to worry about Ngrams or anything. 
2018-04-10 09:26:18	mejohn	sweet, I'll grab it now. Thanks for letting me know you're busy, we'll get it working :slightly_smiling_face:

2018-04-10 15:10:47	msbrown3	Hey everyone. Our codebase now uses PostGIS for geospacial locations. If you're running postgres, you'll need to install the PostGIS extension to Postgres. You'll have to change settings.py to use PostGIS also. Instructions:
2018-04-10 15:10:47		Install PostGIS:
2018-04-10 15:10:47		    # yum install https://download.postgresql.org/pub/repos/yum/9.6/redhat/rhel-7-x86_64/pgdg-centos96-9.6-3.noarch.rpm
2018-04-10 15:10:47		    # yum install postgresql96 postgresql96-server postgresql96-devel postgis24_96
2018-04-10 15:10:47		Activate PostGIS extension:
2018-04-10 15:10:47		    $ python manage.py dbshell --database data
2018-04-10 15:10:47		    rd_data=# CREATE EXTENSION postGIS;
2018-04-10 15:10:47		In `project/settings.py`, update the database engine to use PostGIS:
2018-04-10 15:10:47		    'ENGINE': 'django.contrib.gis.db.backends.postgis',
2018-04-10 15:10:47		As usual, on database schema changes, you'll need to migrate:
2018-04-10 15:10:47		    $ python manage.py makemigrations
2018-04-10 15:10:47		    $ python manage.py migrate
2018-04-10 15:10:47		    $ python manage.py migrate --database data

2018-02-12 11:02:37	mdkowole	I have the script to extract symptoms from nord. I’ll need to add a second filter but that’s ok. My question is how to put it into Postgres. Do you want a column for each symptom or on blob for each disease(easier)?if it’s a column, I can only give generic labels. They vary with each disease  
2018-02-12 11:03:37	mdkowole	I figured you could search the blob for the key words.  
2018-02-12 11:04:14	mejohn	blob works for django search. Makes graph db a little harder, but django's our focus right now

2018-02-12 12:49:55	msbrown3	Mike, did you ever get the rest of the datafiles from http://orphadata.org (orphadata.org)? 
2018-02-12 12:52:08	mdkowole	No. I focused on getting symptoms from nord. I figured that we had to wait to hear back from orphadata before we did anything. About to harvest symptoms from nord  
2018-02-12 12:58:40	msbrown3	Ok. Let me know when you hear back from them. I wanted to see what they have in those extra datasets, maybe incorporate it on rarediseases.oscar. Looks like it doesn't directly include the symptoms that you're scraping, so it's good you're doing that. 
2018-02-12 13:27:55	mdkowole	I’m close. Just need Megan to fix the Postgres piece. Can’t get the script right regarding writing to dB.  
2018-02-12 13:28:06	mdkowole	I’ll send to you as well 
2018-02-13 12:57:23	mdkowole	The symptoms table is in the fda database. Should be populated by 12:30. I’ve added a pdf to drive that shows how it is used to trigger data collection based on symptoms. It’s referred to as the hpo table in the PDF [:+1:2] 
2018-02-13 13:12:27	mejohn	agensgraph 1.3 doesn't support string matching clauses (LIKE, CONTAINS, etc) so we can build the relationships in sql and then translate to edges, or wait for them to fix it. Was trying to use it for 'if nih grant abstract contains disease name, add edge' 
2018-02-13 13:14:07	mdkowole	I’d go with the former. Figure you make the association and use a verb(or category/relationship) for edge.  
2018-02-13 13:14:29	mejohn	ok 
2018-02-14 08:47:46	mejohn	Any objections to merging our data to one database? I think it's fine to have separate ones for tables that we're still figuring out a schema for, but keeping data separate by source makes it harder to create relationships. 
2018-02-20 08:29:44	msbrown3	@mdkowole, have you heard back from the OrphaData people yet about getting their whole dataset?

2018-02-23 17:29:09	mejohn	updates and start of new ui pushed to https://rarediseases.oscar.ncsu.edu @mdkowole 
2018-02-23 17:29:09		we lost functionality of location searching for hospitals ans specialists (just haven't implemented in new ui) will work on later this weekend unless it's necessary asap 
2018-02-28 09:40:37	mejohn	@Arun @Janne @jesse @Sagar just checking in before the meeting tomorrow, how is associating specialists with their rare diseases going? 
2018-02-28 09:55:53	jesse	Hey Meaghan. It's going okay. I found an issue with the pubmed data containing a lot of duplicates, which I wrote a quick program to resolve. The duplicates were coming in because when we searched for multiple different rare diseases, we would get back the same article. 
2018-02-28 09:55:53		There are a couple other issues as well. When we filtered the pubmed data to only include NC, we got only the pubmed articles which had an author's associated medical school in NC. Contrast this to the specialists data, which was filtered to only include specialists whose hospital was in NC... Many specialists came from another state and now work for a hospital in north carolina and many specialists went to a medical school in NC and left to work at a hospital from another state. 
2018-02-28 09:55:53		So we would only get people who went to a medical school in NC and worked at a hospital in NC, which wouldn't get very many hits with the pubmed data. (but did get hits from Michael Knowles, and a few other physicians.)
2018-02-28 09:55:53		A possible solution would be to get all of the pubmed articles and match that to every specialist in USA. I found a data set that would include all these specialists as well as a few fields we don't have (which would include the hospital they work for and the medical school they went to) (but probably not gps coordinates). 
2018-02-28 10:00:21	mdkowole	Remember they could have done research outside of nc or school outside of nc but are here now 
2018-02-28 10:00:28	msbrown3	If we have the hospital they work at, we can geolocate it to get GPS coordinates or zipcode [:+1:1] 
2018-02-28 10:01:33	mejohn	neat! I'm glad you resolved the issues with pubmed. If it won't take too much more time, I think that your solution sounds like the best way forward that's also future-proof. I'm okay with not having direct gps coordinates right now. We are hoping to have something to show off that we can make the specialists search smart by the meeting next thursday (not tomorrow). Is there anything Michael or I could help with to get that done? 
2018-02-28 10:07:45	jesse	Sagar and I were having trouble comparing the medical school that the physicians went to with the medical school listed under the pubmed article. UNC Chapel Hill School of Medicine would be an easy example, as stripping away the nonsense would just leave Chapel Hill.... But   trying to compare some of the other schools, like North Carolina State University is difficult because there are no unique words in North Carolina State University. 
2018-02-28 10:13:39	jesse	This is the physicians data I have been using: 
2018-02-28 10:13:39		https://data.medicare.gov/Physician-Compare/Physician-Compare-National-Downloadable-File/mj5m-pzi6 
2018-02-28 10:13:39		and as for getting the pubmed data set for all of the united states (probably would contain other countries too), I've been looking here:
2018-02-28 10:13:39		https://www.nlm.nih.gov/databases/download/pubmed_medline.html
2018-02-28 10:13:39		I was going to look for a convenient way of turning the XML stuff into postgres. It provides full sets of the data yearly with daily updates.... if we tried to webscrape all of the pubmed stuff... I'm roughly estimating that would take at least 300 hours... but downloading it directly shouldn't take much time at all.  (edited)
2018-02-28 10:14:23	jesse	That basically sums up what I've been doing/looking into for the week. :slightly_smiling_face: 
2018-02-28 10:15:42	jesse	I got the first link from Thomas' team in 495 class btw. 
2018-02-28 18:21:58	jesse	That 300 hour thing was completely false.... based on the test I just ran, it would take about 22 hours to generate all of the pubmed articles relating to rare diseases using the scraper I made. (i think this will be preferable to downloading all of pubmed... but that is still an option) 
2018-02-28 18:23:00	mejohn	Michael does have a way to go from xml to Django, that might be worth exploring tomorrow 
2018-02-28 18:23:44	jesse	sure. I'll still have the script run in case we want those csv's. [:+1:1]

2018-04-10 09:17:41	jesse	it doesnt have an orpha id though. 
2018-04-10 09:22:30	mejohn	ok awesome! we can put it up there with a full text search for the disease name for this week, if you think it'll take a while to get the orpha ids in 
2018-04-10 09:25:34	jesse	I'm pretty backed up on school work, so I wont be able to work on that part.
2018-04-10 09:25:34		 but it shouldnt be too hard to get the disease id. The disease names should follow the same format as the orpha stuff so I dont think youll need to worry about Ngrams or anything. 
2018-04-10 09:26:18	mejohn	sweet, I'll grab it now. Thanks for letting me know you're busy, we'll get it working :slightly_smiling_face:

2018-04-10 15:10:47	msbrown3	Hey everyone. Our codebase now uses PostGIS for geospacial locations. If you're running postgres, you'll need to install the PostGIS extension to Postgres. You'll have to change settings.py to use PostGIS also. Instructions:
2018-04-10 15:10:47		Install PostGIS:
2018-04-10 15:10:47		    # yum install https://download.postgresql.org/pub/repos/yum/9.6/redhat/rhel-7-x86_64/pgdg-centos96-9.6-3.noarch.rpm
2018-04-10 15:10:47		    # yum install postgresql96 postgresql96-server postgresql96-devel postgis24_96
2018-04-10 15:10:47		Activate PostGIS extension:
2018-04-10 15:10:47		    $ python manage.py dbshell --database data
2018-04-10 15:10:47		    rd_data=# CREATE EXTENSION postGIS;
2018-04-10 15:10:47		In `project/settings.py`, update the database engine to use PostGIS:
2018-04-10 15:10:47		    'ENGINE': 'django.contrib.gis.db.backends.postgis',
2018-04-10 15:10:47		As usual, on database schema changes, you'll need to migrate:
2018-04-10 15:10:47		    $ python manage.py makemigrations
2018-04-10 15:10:47		    $ python manage.py migrate
2018-04-10 15:10:47		    $ python manage.py migrate --database data

2018-02-12 11:02:37	mdkowole	I have the script to extract symptoms from nord. I’ll need to add a second filter but that’s ok. My question is how to put it into Postgres. Do you want a column for each symptom or on blob for each disease(easier)?if it’s a column, I can only give generic labels. They vary with each disease  
2018-02-12 11:03:37	mdkowole	I figured you could search the blob for the key words.  
2018-02-12 11:04:14	mejohn	blob works for django search. Makes graph db a little harder, but django's our focus right now

2018-02-12 11:09:02	mejohn	Does the gene_id in allele_gene relate to the mim number in any way? 
2018-02-12 11:32:19	mdkowole	I need to check 
2018-02-12 11:32:44	mdkowole	What database do you want the symptoms table in? 
2018-02-12 11:45:22	mejohn	where'd you pull the info from? a different source? We've combined all of the tabels into one database for production, so it really doesn't matter anymore 
2018-02-12 11:46:53	mdkowole	I haven’t pulled the trigger yet. I’m setting up the script and want to  create a table to send the data to. The source is nord  
2018-02-12 11:47:26	mdkowole	Two columns. Disease and symptoms  
2018-02-12 11:48:15	mdkowole	Will do test of about 20 before I do all 7000 
2018-02-12 11:48:48	mejohn	put it in fda for now, with the orphan drugs 
2018-02-12 11:48:57	mdkowole	Ok  
2018-02-12 12:49:55	msbrown3	Mike, did you ever get the rest of the datafiles from http://orphadata.org (orphadata.org)? 
2018-02-12 12:52:08	mdkowole	No. I focused on getting symptoms from nord. I figured that we had to wait to hear back from orphadata before we did anything. About to harvest symptoms from nord  
2018-02-12 12:58:40	msbrown3	Ok. Let me know when you hear back from them. I wanted to see what they have in those extra datasets, maybe incorporate it on rarediseases.oscar. Looks like it doesn't directly include the symptoms that you're scraping, so it's good you're doing that. 
2018-02-12 13:27:55	mdkowole	I’m close. Just need Megan to fix the Postgres piece. Can’t get the script right regarding writing to dB.  
2018-02-12 13:28:06	mdkowole	I’ll send to you as well 
2018-02-13 12:57:23	mdkowole	The symptoms table is in the fda database. Should be populated by 12:30. I’ve added a pdf to drive that shows how it is used to trigger data collection based on symptoms. It’s referred to as the hpo table in the PDF [:+1:2] 
2018-02-13 13:12:27	mejohn	agensgraph 1.3 doesn't support string matching clauses (LIKE, CONTAINS, etc) so we can build the relationships in sql and then translate to edges, or wait for them to fix it. Was trying to use it for 'if nih grant abstract contains disease name, add edge' 
2018-02-13 13:14:07	mdkowole	I’d go with the former. Figure you make the association and use a verb(or category/relationship) for edge.  
2018-02-13 13:14:29	mejohn	ok 
2018-02-14 08:47:46	mejohn	Any objections to merging our data to one database? I think it's fine to have separate ones for tables that we're still figuring out a schema for, but keeping data separate by source makes it harder to create relationships. 
2018-02-20 08:29:44	msbrown3	@mdkowole, have you heard back from the OrphaData people yet about getting their whole dataset?

2018-02-23 17:29:09		we lost functionality of location searching for hospitals ans specialists (just haven't implemented in new ui) will work on later this weekend unless it's necessary asap 
2018-02-28 09:40:37	mejohn	@Arun @Janne @jesse @Sagar just checking in before the meeting tomorrow, how is associating specialists with their rare diseases going? 
2018-02-28 09:55:53	jesse	Hey Meaghan. It's going okay. I found an issue with the pubmed data containing a lot of duplicates, which I wrote a quick program to resolve. The duplicates were coming in because when we searched for multiple different rare diseases, we would get back the same article. 
2018-02-28 09:55:53		There are a couple other issues as well. When we filtered the pubmed data to only include NC, we got only the pubmed articles which had an author's associated medical school in NC. Contrast this to the specialists data, which was filtered to only include specialists whose hospital was in NC... Many specialists came from another state and now work for a hospital in north carolina and many specialists went to a medical school in NC and left to work at a hospital from another state. 
2018-02-28 09:55:53		So we would only get people who went to a medical school in NC and worked at a hospital in NC, which wouldn't get very many hits with the pubmed data. (but did get hits from Michael Knowles, and a few other physicians.)
2018-02-28 09:55:53		A possible solution would be to get all of the pubmed articles and match that to every specialist in USA. I found a data set that would include all these specialists as well as a few fields we don't have (which would include the hospital they work for and the medical school they went to) (but probably not gps coordinates). 
2018-02-28 10:00:21	mdkowole	Remember they could have done research outside of nc or school outside of nc but are here now 
2018-02-28 10:00:28	msbrown3	If we have the hospital they work at, we can geolocate it to get GPS coordinates or zipcode [:+1:1] 
2018-02-28 10:01:33	mejohn	neat! I'm glad you resolved the issues with pubmed. If it won't take too much more time, I think that your solution sounds like the best way forward that's also future-proof. I'm okay with not having direct gps coordinates right now. We are hoping to have something to show off that we can make the specialists search smart by the meeting next thursday (not tomorrow). Is there anything Michael or I could help with to get that done? 
2018-02-28 10:07:45	jesse	Sagar and I were having trouble comparing the medical school that the physicians went to with the medical school listed under the pubmed article. UNC Chapel Hill School of Medicine would be an easy example, as stripping away the nonsense would just leave Chapel Hill.... But   trying to compare some of the other schools, like North Carolina State University is difficult because there are no unique words in North Carolina State University. 
2018-02-28 10:13:39	jesse	This is the physicians data I have been using: 
2018-02-28 10:13:39		https://data.medicare.gov/Physician-Compare/Physician-Compare-National-Downloadable-File/mj5m-pzi6 
2018-02-28 10:13:39		and as for getting the pubmed data set for all of the united states (probably would contain other countries too), I've been looking here:
2018-02-28 10:13:39		https://www.nlm.nih.gov/databases/download/pubmed_medline.html
2018-02-28 10:13:39		I was going to look for a convenient way of turning the XML stuff into postgres. It provides full sets of the data yearly with daily updates.... if we tried to webscrape all of the pubmed stuff... I'm roughly estimating that would take at least 300 hours... but downloading it directly shouldn't take much time at all.  (edited)
2018-02-28 10:14:23	jesse	That basically sums up what I've been doing/looking into for the week. :slightly_smiling_face: 
2018-02-28 10:15:42	jesse	I got the first link from Thomas' team in 495 class btw. 
2018-02-28 18:21:58	jesse	That 300 hour thing was completely false.... based on the test I just ran, it would take about 22 hours to generate all of the pubmed articles relating to rare diseases using the scraper I made. (i think this will be preferable to downloading all of pubmed... but that is still an option) 
2018-02-28 18:23:00	mejohn	Michael does have a way to go from xml to Django, that might be worth exploring tomorrow 
2018-02-28 18:23:44	jesse	sure. I'll still have the script run in case we want those csv's. [:+1:1]

2018-04-10 09:17:41	jesse	it doesnt have an orpha id though. 
2018-04-10 09:22:30	mejohn	ok awesome! we can put it up there with a full text search for the disease name for this week, if you think it'll take a while to get the orpha ids in 
2018-04-10 09:25:34	jesse	I'm pretty backed up on school work, so I wont be able to work on that part.
2018-04-10 09:25:34		 but it shouldnt be too hard to get the disease id. The disease names should follow the same format as the orpha stuff so I dont think youll need to worry about Ngrams or anything. 
2018-04-10 09:26:18	mejohn	sweet, I'll grab it now. Thanks for letting me know you're busy, we'll get it working :slightly_smiling_face:

2018-04-10 15:10:47	msbrown3	Hey everyone. Our codebase now uses PostGIS for geospacial locations. If you're running postgres, you'll need to install the PostGIS extension to Postgres. You'll have to change settings.py to use PostGIS also. Instructions:
2018-04-10 15:10:47		Install PostGIS:
2018-04-10 15:10:47		    # yum install https://download.postgresql.org/pub/repos/yum/9.6/redhat/rhel-7-x86_64/pgdg-centos96-9.6-3.noarch.rpm
2018-04-10 15:10:47		    # yum install postgresql96 postgresql96-server postgresql96-devel postgis24_96
2018-04-10 15:10:47		Activate PostGIS extension:
2018-04-10 15:10:47		    $ python manage.py dbshell --database data
2018-04-10 15:10:47		    rd_data=# CREATE EXTENSION postGIS;
2018-04-10 15:10:47		In `project/settings.py`, update the database engine to use PostGIS:
2018-04-10 15:10:47		    'ENGINE': 'django.contrib.gis.db.backends.postgis',
2018-04-10 15:10:47		As usual, on database schema changes, you'll need to migrate:
2018-04-10 15:10:47		    $ python manage.py makemigrations
2018-04-10 15:10:47		    $ python manage.py migrate
2018-04-10 15:10:47		    $ python manage.py migrate --database data

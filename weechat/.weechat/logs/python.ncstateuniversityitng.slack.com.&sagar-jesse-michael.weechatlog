2018-04-18 15:28:55	msbrown3	So hey Jesse. Sagar and I are on pubmed-jesse.oscar.priv, and thinking about using postgres9.6 because 9.2 is pretty old 
2018-04-18 15:29:21	msbrown3	just made this channel to coordinate, since you obviously have data on the 9.2 version 
2018-04-18 15:29:27	jesse	please dont change this now. 
2018-04-18 15:29:43	jesse	i think the pubmed script is still running 
2018-04-18 15:30:07	msbrown3	ok. might have messed somethnig up, but we'll see 
2018-04-18 15:34:11	jesse	:( 
2018-04-18 15:41:14	msbrown3	If the script is still running it should be fine 
2018-04-18 15:54:19	jesse	I'll check now 
2018-04-18 15:57:20	jesse	It terminated. 
2018-04-18 15:57:35	msbrown3	:disappointed: sorry 
2018-04-18 15:57:42	jesse	wait.. hold up. 
2018-04-18 15:58:20	jesse	yeah its dead 
2018-04-18 15:58:44	jesse	so you just updated psql right? 
2018-04-18 15:59:20	msbrown3	we were restarting postgres and stuff cause we wanted to see if 9.6 would solve our problem 
2018-04-18 15:59:35	msbrown3	still running 9.2, since I think we solved our problems 
2018-04-18 16:00:20	jesse	ok. So am I good to rerun the script? 
2018-04-18 16:00:31	msbrown3	yeah 
2018-04-18 16:00:38	msbrown3	you're running on the raredx database, right? 
2018-04-18 16:01:24	jesse	yup 
2018-04-18 16:01:41	msbrown3	ok 
2018-04-18 16:01:52	msbrown3	really sorry about that 
2018-04-18 16:04:17	jesse	that's fine. I think the progress bar had estimated around 2 days for this script but I'm not entirely sure how accurate that is. So twice what it was before. It's also quite heavy on disk space, so please don't add/ generate any big files. 
2018-04-18 16:05:58	jesse	Before I could have just restarted from where it had left off but I guess for whatever reason, this time, the progress bar glitched out when it got the error.

2018-04-23 16:48:19	Sagar	Sorry about the confusion earlier. I need to test my changes, can you please access me to rd_user as all of my data is owned by that user and I had to start from scratch for all the changes again if I had to change the user 
2018-04-23 16:50:14	jesse	...you may need to start from scratch again cuz rd_data doesnt seem to exist. I didnt even know you were using the vm... or a database other than raredx 
2018-04-23 16:50:27	jesse	sorry dude. 
2018-04-23 16:50:38	jesse	what was it? 
2018-04-23 16:51:18	Sagar	I tried doing psql rd_data from postgres sudo user but it is asking for a password 
2018-04-23 16:51:33	Sagar	I thought you set that password 
2018-04-23 16:52:03	Sagar	Maybe because of that it's showing as not exist 
2018-04-23 16:52:49	Sagar	I was working on clinical trials thing and making a new date column for getting latest ones 
2018-04-23 16:53:10	jesse	would it be easy to regenerate? 
2018-04-23 16:54:21	jesse	postgres password is 'password' 
2018-04-23 16:54:26	Sagar	You mean generating rd_data 
2018-04-23 16:54:32	jesse	yup. 
2018-04-23 16:55:42	Sagar	I have to see that as all of my data was in that database and if it doesn't exist anymore then I have to start all over anyhow 
2018-04-23 16:57:48	jesse	your data is not in the database cuz i had to upgrade postgres to 9.6 to try to relieve a problem i was having.  the backup file i made only contained 'raredx' cuz i thought that was our only database. 
2018-04-23 17:00:06	Sagar	I created rd_data because I knew you were working on raredx and didn't wanted to interrupt with your work 
2018-04-23 17:00:16	jesse	:( 
2018-04-23 17:00:32	jesse	I'm sorry dude.

2018-04-23 16:45:08	Sagar	Hey Jesse, Did you changed the password for 'rd_user'? As I'm not able to connect to the database 'rd_data' 
2018-04-23 16:45:58	jesse	I had to do a bunch of junk to get postgres back running on pubmed-jesse. i can make you a new user. 
2018-04-23 16:48:19	Sagar	Sorry about the confusion earlier. I need to test my changes, can you please access me to rd_user as all of my data is owned by that user and I had to start from scratch for all the changes again if I had to change the user

2018-04-23 17:01:20	Sagar	Thanks! 
2018-04-23 17:07:13	jesse	is there a reason we aren't using postgres 10.3? I mean we went through all this effort to upgrade to 9.6 rather than 9.2... 
2018-04-23 17:11:02	Sagar	That's a good question... I was also thinking that and we most probably went to 9.6 because of postGIS and shifting to latest version will make sense. That's what I think but Michael would be the right person to answer this 
2018-04-23 18:17:52	msbrown3	yea, I don't think there's a reason we couldn't upgrade to 10.3

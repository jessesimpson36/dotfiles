2018-04-12 13:38:58		getting channel history...
2018-02-16 17:29:48	jesse	I'm gonna be working on the pubmed scripts a lil right now. 
2018-02-16 19:09:29	Arun	Oh, alright. Will you be starting off by reusing sagar/janne's code by any chance? 
2018-02-16 19:09:43	jesse	yup. have you been workin on it? 
2018-02-16 19:12:01	Arun	Not yet, I was just asking so that even I can look into it :slightly_smiling_face: 
2018-02-16 19:13:26	jesse	i gotcha. if youre wanting to work on it now, I can push what I have, but I'm still gonna be moving forward 
2018-02-16 19:14:08	Arun	That would be great! :slightly_smiling_face: 
2018-02-16 19:15:59	jesse	done. What I've been doing is trying to print out the important info about each article. Once I can print one out in a nice way, I'm going to create variables for everything and append it to a dataframe which will eventually turn into a CSV 
2018-02-16 19:17:25	jesse	also, the csv name at the bottom will be changed. Its the contractors one now because I was copying and pasting stuff 
2018-02-16 19:18:07	jesse	My current issue is that I would like to get a date out of the article. 
2018-02-16 19:22:18	Arun	Great, that is perfect!  
2018-02-16 19:22:36	Arun	Is there any significance for the date field? 
2018-02-16 19:23:13	Arun	Other than just to sort the articles chronologically? 
2018-02-16 19:27:21	jesse	not really. My thinking was just that a date might be nice to have. If 2 articles are about the same rare_dx, then maybe the newer one might be more credible. but this would just be a side objective. A better solution is to find some sort of id field, since we already have a table in a database for pubmed stuff. (the problem with that table is that it only has the first initial of the last name or first name.) 
2018-02-16 19:30:15	Arun	Oh, I see. Where exactly is that database? In that http://power6.ncsu.edu (power6.ncsu.edu) machine? I mean, is there any other databases that we have? 
2018-02-16 19:32:21	jesse	on power6a in ncbi database 
2018-02-16 19:32:35	Arun	Okay okay cool. 
2018-02-16 19:33:19	Arun	And yeah, I am going through the script that you uploaded now. And I will also take a look at what Janne and Sagar has done 
2018-02-16 19:34:01	jesse	this was built off of what sagar did. I'm not sure Janne had anything worth pushing 
2018-02-16 19:37:20	jesse	the table for the pubmed rare diseases should not be counted on. it only has 1000 rows. I think we will have to create our own. 
2018-02-16 19:37:51	jesse	and they didn't even store date :disappointed: 
2018-02-16 19:41:47	Arun	Oh I see. Anyway, we do have the APIs to get the data right? For pubmed 
2018-02-16 19:42:12	jesse	thats what the Bio package at the top is. 
2018-02-16 19:42:28	Arun	Yeah right. Okay cool!  
2018-02-16 19:42:30	jesse	we basically have the data, but its kinda a blobby dictionary thats hard to get through 
2018-02-16 19:42:56	Arun	Ah, like that! Alright, got it  
2018-02-16 19:44:55	jesse	ok i got the date. I'm gonna push again if ya don't mind. 
2018-02-16 19:46:21	Arun	But anyway, if required, can we meet once on Sunday? Only if you are free  
2018-02-16 19:46:30	Arun	Awesome :grin: 
2018-02-16 19:46:38	jesse	yup. 
2018-02-16 19:47:37	jesse	ok i pushed the stuff. 
2018-02-16 19:47:41	Arun	So, I?ll go through everything and see if I?m able to understand everything that we?ve got! And Sunday I?ll ask you the questions if I have any, and we can probably sit together and get done with this part!  
2018-02-16 19:48:50	jesse	Sounds good. 
2018-02-17 21:28:14	Arun	Hey Jesse, Will you be free post lunch tomorrow? 
2018-02-18 07:54:57	jesse	yeah 
2018-02-18 11:11:16	Arun	Great, shall we meet at 4pm today then? For about 1-2 hours maximum  
2018-02-18 11:20:23	jesse	Sounds good. I've been doing quite a bit of work to this script. for the most part, I just need to let you know what my current code gathers, the errors I'm running into, what needs to be done with the outputted CSV files, and stuff like that. My thinking is after we meet at 4, I can hand the rest of the work concerning pubmed stuff to you, and I can then switch to working on the drug company data and some of the other minor tasks. 
2018-02-18 14:38:33	Arun	Sure, I?ll be in Hunt grad commons. I?ve booked room number 4314  
2018-02-18 14:39:18	jesse	can undergrads go there? 
2018-02-18 14:40:01	Arun	Ah, I totally forgot about that! But I guess you can come inside if I'm with you 
2018-02-18 14:41:52	jesse	ok. are you there now or should i wait till 4? 
2018-02-18 14:42:16	Arun	I am here in library. We can meet now, sure! But the room is available only from 4 
2018-02-18 14:42:40	Arun	So, if you can find another room, I sure can come 
2018-02-18 14:46:44	jesse	I just checked. there is no room available that I can reserve.  
2018-02-18 14:47:03	Arun	Yeah, that's what I thought too! 
2018-02-18 14:47:29	Arun	Anyway, we can still meet now if you wish 
2018-02-18 14:52:32	jesse	sure. I'm just laying in my bed anyway. give me a few minutes to finish the current csv my computer is workin on and so I can make tea /get ready to leave 
2018-02-18 14:52:56	Arun	Yeah sure, take your time! :slightly_smiling_face: 
2018-02-18 15:03:18	jesse	im at the library now 
2018-02-18 15:03:46	Arun	Oh good. Can you come to 4th floor? I'll come near the lift 
2018-02-18 18:36:25	jesse	Did you specify in LibreOffice that the CSV's were comma separated when you opened it? 
2018-02-18 18:36:50	jesse	usually it says "separate by [] comma  [] semicolon [] space... etc 
2018-02-18 18:37:18	jesse	In the big CSV, I'm getting no entries that are overflowing. 
2018-02-18 18:39:05	jesse	Same with the little csv 
2018-02-18 18:40:22	Arun	Ah really? Damn, I didn?t notice that! But yeah, the next time I open it I?ll check that too 
2018-02-18 18:44:23	jesse	I'm gonna run the entire thing once more to try to locate the XML parsing error. hopefully I'll be able to narrow it down to a place and put a try/except thing around it to just skip the document if it fails to parse. 
2018-02-18 18:44:56	jesse	If you already have that stacktrace in your terminal, could you check the line number? 
2018-02-18 18:50:04	jesse	i think i'll just put an except around the search/query part. my guess is thats where the issue is. 
2018-02-18 18:58:01	Arun	Gimme sometime, I?ll check and let you know the line number  
2018-02-18 19:27:34	Arun	My new CSV is being generated now, and I cannot check back the stacktrace 
2018-02-18 19:27:51	jesse	thats ok. I've got a CSV generating myself. 
2018-02-18 19:28:38	jesse	quick trick: if you run "tmux" you can detach the terminal so that you can close out of the terminal and do other things while the program is being run in the background. [:+1:1 :heavy_check_mark:1] 
2018-02-18 21:16:47	jesse	I got the full csv and it's beautiful 
2018-02-18 21:17:20	jesse	i mean, its what you'd expect... a csv, but I've been working quite hard just to get it lol 
2018-02-18 21:23:57	jesse	also, I don't think I pulled your changes, since you removed the fun stuff like abstract and title 
2018-02-19 18:23:21	jesse	Hey Arun, you have yurika working on your computer right? 
2018-02-19 18:23:45	jesse	Janne was wanting to use it for getting info on drug companies. 
2018-02-19 20:40:41	Arun	Hey yeah, I have it in Running! Sorry, for the late reply  
2018-02-19 20:41:27	Arun	Janne wants to use it? Sure, we can try using it. But the websites that we use should allow crawling  
2018-02-19 20:42:18	jesse	cool. I'm not sure what Janne needs. I was working with her tonight and the drug company information is chaos. I'll try to ask Janne and get her to message 
2018-02-19 20:42:19	jesse	you 
2018-02-19 20:42:35	Arun	Or I can ping Janne right away and save some time :)  
2018-02-19 20:43:08	jesse	cool! I hope it works out. 
2018-02-19 20:43:22	Arun	Alright, pinged her now!  
2018-02-19 20:44:11	jesse	Thanks dude. i tried it on my computer but i think postgresql is forever broke on my computer from trying to mess with agensgraph 
2018-02-19 20:44:58	Arun	Ah, I see! Alright, not an issue! Let?s see if we are able to get the data using Yurika  
2018-02-26 12:51:32	Arun	Hey Jesse, I just realized that I have some work for today evening. Is it alright if we push today's meeting to tomorrow? 
2018-02-26 12:58:37	jesse	i guess that depends on everyone else. i could probably meet both today and tomorrow and not run out of things to do. 
2018-02-26 12:59:04	Arun	Okay, If others are making it, I'll try to make it too! 
2018-02-26 12:59:56	jesse	ok. if not, I can just let you know what happens, whether its by text or meeting up tomorrow. 
2018-02-26 13:00:39	Arun	Alright, that's great! I'll keep you posted :slightly_smiling_face: 
2018-02-27 09:06:59	jesse	Hey Arun, I met up with Sagar last night, and Janne separately. we've got a few issues with the pubmed stuff.
2018-02-27 09:06:59		I'll give ya a quick run down:
2018-02-27 09:06:59		our pubmed data filtered everyone who were affiliated with medical schools in NC
2018-02-27 09:06:59		our specialist data filtered everyone whos hospital was in NC.
2018-02-27 09:06:59		issue 1.   many people work in NC hospitals and have their medical degrees from places outside of NC.
2018-02-27 09:06:59		but lets ignore that for now.
2018-02-27 09:06:59		issue 2. the medical schools in the pubmed data is not uniform with the specialists data for schools they came from. matching UNC Chapel Hill would be fairly easy since Chapel Hill is unique... but take North Carolina State University... filter out the unnecessary words like "north carolina" and "university" and your left with ..."state"... which doesnt help. also consider that many pubmed researchers dont seem to be affiliated with a university or school of medicine... but rather just a lab...
2018-02-27 09:06:59		Back to Issue 1. If we want to fix this, we would be looking to scrape all of the pubmed data  rather than just NC (an estimated 300hr process with extra hours for filtering duplicates.)   alternatively, we could just  not filter the specialists at all but this comes with its own risks. (still preferable but it leads us back to issue 2.)
2018-02-27 09:06:59		As for Janne, she's been working hard scraping the drug company data. sadly a good amount of her work  must be done manually. 
2018-02-27 15:29:47	Arun	Hey Jesse, just seeing your message now. Thanks for the update! 
2018-02-27 15:31:00	Arun	Regarding issue 1, we can try to write a write to check if we are getting data properly, say upto 1000 or 10000 rows. Once we are sure about the script, we can request a machine to Meaghan and we can run our script in that machine, instead of running in our personal machine 
2018-02-27 15:42:01	jesse	that sounds reasonable, but it may be better if we could just download the entire pubmed data set rather than webscraping: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/databases/download/pubmed_medline.html
2018-02-27 15:42:01		I'm not sure if this would be too much memory or not, but they also have daily update files so we wouldn't have to re-download it every time... we would just need a way to convert the xml to postgresql... [:+1:1] 
2018-02-27 15:48:34	Arun	Oh yeah, I didnt know we could download the data directly. 
2018-02-27 15:49:28	Arun	Btw, for this week I am yet to clock in and start working on specialist-disease relation 
2018-02-27 15:49:48	jesse	ya wanna task? 
2018-02-27 15:50:02	Arun	I've been busy with my stuff. I guess I will be able to work a maximum of only 8-10 hours this week and next week 
2018-02-27 15:50:53	Arun	I will try writing the script to manipulate the name according to the pubmed data and see if I can find matches 
2018-02-27 15:51:03	Arun	Once I am done with that work, I can work on other task 
2018-02-27 15:51:28	jesse	hold on with that. 
2018-02-27 15:51:46	Arun	Are you sure about it? 
2018-02-27 15:52:01	Arun	I can hold on it and work on something more important if there is any 
2018-02-27 15:54:13	jesse	part of this past meeting was that since we cannot just match first and last name, since many first names are not full names... So we wanted to link them to their universities. So if a person with the last name of Hayes went to Chapel Hill in pubmed, we could say that they are the same person who is listed in specialists as Hayes who went to Chapel Hill. Do ya follow? 
2018-02-27 15:54:49	Arun	Okay, I get it. Yeah, it makes sense 
2018-02-27 15:56:05	jesse	Also, If we download the entire pubmed thing... and somehow make it into a pubmed database, we will need to modify whatever script you were planning on writing. 
2018-02-27 15:56:28	Arun	But, Is it the only way to confirm if two persons are the same? Is there other possibilities to confirm that. I was thinking something like, if the name is Mathew Hayes and we have M Hayes, chances that they both are same is quite high, whats your thought on that? 
2018-02-27 15:58:23	jesse	we could check firstname too... but ideally we would want M Hayes from Chapel Hill === Mathew Hayes from Chapel Hill... If we are opening up all of pubmed to all of the specialists in the united states... then first and last name is no longer accurate enough.. since there are a ton of mathew hayes from the united states whereas maybe not so much with just NC. 
2018-02-27 15:58:50	Arun	Yeah agreed! 
2018-02-27 16:00:22	Arun	But since there are way too many pubmed data and too many specialists too, the computation could take more time when we start comparing different fields simulatenously, I thought. 
2018-02-27 16:00:22		But nevertheless, what you said would definitely work :slightly_smiling_face: 
2018-02-27 16:04:28	jesse	it would take more time, but it would maybe be a couple hour process just from a rough estimate i think 
2018-02-27 16:04:46	jesse	I'll still need to confirm with Kowolenko before we actually try to do this [:+1:1] 
2018-02-27 16:25:19	Arun	Yeah thats right. And Okay, so meanwhile what do you want me to work on? 
2018-02-27 16:28:18	jesse	I think you should look into trying to find a way to compare the medical school names and see if the medical school names in the specialists match with the pubmed affiliations. 
2018-02-27 16:40:26	Arun	Okay, I will look at that today and let you know when I am done with it 
2018-02-27 16:41:25	jesse	xD I wouldn't expect you to be done with it. but let me know what your thinking about that problem. Also figured we should clarify that for the specialists, we are referring to the data from http://medicare.gov (medicare.gov) rather than the other specialist data we gathered. 
2018-02-27 16:43:07	Arun	Ahh, I see. Alright. I will look into that website and see what data we've got. And yeah, I will let you know my thoughts before I actually start coding it 
2018-02-27 16:46:31	jesse	https://data.medicare.gov/Physician-Compare/Physician-Compare-National-Downloadable-File/mj5m-pzi6
2018-02-27 16:46:31		Physician Compare National Downloadable File | Data.Medicare.gov
2018-02-27 16:46:31		Physician Compare National Downloadable File - The Physician Compare National Downloadable File is organized at the individual eligible professional level; each line is unique at the professional/enrollment record/Group Practice/address level. Professionals with multiple Medicare enrollment records and/or single enrollments linking to multiple practice location addresses are listed on multiple lines. [:heavy_check_mark:1 :+1:1 :slightly_smiling_face:1] 
2018-02-27 20:13:11	jesse	Hey Arun, have you been working on that problem? ^^ 
2018-02-27 20:13:48	Arun	Not yet Jesse, I was planning to look at it tonight post dinner 
2018-02-27 20:14:50	jesse	ahh I gotcha. I was just wonderin. I'm trying to decide what I wanna do, whether it's eat dinner, work on this, or go back to my apartment and play a video game :stuck_out_tongue: 
2018-02-27 20:38:51	Arun	Haha, sometime  of video game wouldn't hurt anything I believe! :smile: 
2018-02-27 21:09:54	jesse	sadly I chose to work on another project :disappointed: 
2018-02-28 13:25:40	Arun	Hey Jesse, afternoon! So, I checked out the website and also the pubmed data. What you said makes sense. 
2018-02-28 13:25:40		And once we make all the necessary calculations, we could probably try to sort the list with current NC specialist coming on the top and then in the order of nearest states wrt NC 
2018-02-28 13:26:39	Arun	But we are expected to finish all this by next thursday? 
2018-02-28 13:29:05	jesse	did you read the messages on the rarediseases channel? 
2018-02-28 13:29:16	Arun	Yes I did 
2018-02-28 13:29:29	Arun	I just checked out the messages there 
2018-02-28 13:32:14	jesse	i gotcha. yeah we are supposed to have something to show off by next thursday. I'm thinking the only truly difficult task we will have to deal with is comparing the names of the medical schools.  If we have to download all of the pubmed data, we will have a lot more troubles, which is why I'm going to try to run the script without the NC filter and see if it takes significantly more time or not. 
2018-02-28 13:34:42	Arun	Okay that would be a start. Do you want us to meet anytime this week or weekend? I fear I won't be available next week starting Monday :disappointed: 
2018-02-28 13:35:34	jesse	I'm going to charlotte starting thursday night up until next sunday... I won't be able to meet. I can do google hangouts though... but thats not as helpful 
2018-02-28 13:37:12	Arun	Ah, I see. Alright then, we will figure it out. But let's split up the work and finish it off as much as possible. 
2018-02-28 13:38:05	Arun	One question, why do you want to strip out the University names? Like, you were saying NC State University will result in 'state' which is not of any use. But, why do we have to it? 
2018-02-28 13:44:01	jesse	agreed. I'll have more information tonight... so it'll be clearer what all we need to do by the meeting time tomorrow. No matter what though, we need to find a way to compare the University names.
2018-02-28 13:44:01		As for that, the names of the affiliations in the pubmed data are not the same as the medical schools in the specialists data. We need to find a way to connect people on first/lastname (easy) and then by the university... my thought was that we could strip away some of the meaningless words so that we could match the names of the schools... but that won't work for the above reason you mentioned. Ingrams aren't too great either since swapping North Carolina State University also could match University of North Carolina State.
2018-02-28 13:44:01		Don't get too fixated on things that I say. I'm just trying to get you to understand the problem.  If you can find a way to keep all of the words in and determine that two schools are the same, all power to ya. 
2018-02-28 13:47:57	Arun	Haha, agreed. I understand you are trying to explain me the problem. :slightly_smiling_face: 
2018-02-28 13:50:23	Arun	And alright, meanwhile, let me know if you need anything! 
2018-02-28 13:50:40	jesse	Sure thing. 
2018-03-01 14:03:57	jesse	I posted the notes/todo thing I made for the week. take a look at that and then you can ask me if you have any questions. 
2018-03-01 20:16:16	Arun	Hey, I just had a look at it now. 
2018-03-01 20:19:33	Arun	I see there are immediate stuffs to get done with regard to matching physicians with pubmed data. Will you be working on any task particularly? 
2018-03-01 21:17:22	jesse	i havent decided the order Ill start tackling these things yet. sorry i didnt respond. i was driving 
2018-03-01 21:18:27	Arun	No worries! :slightly_smiling_face: And, let me know how we can go about it, if you got any leads 
2018-03-04 01:18:58	Arun	Hey, so for comparing the affiliation from pubmed and physician's medical school name, we can probably just check if medical school name is present in pubmed affiliation. 
2018-03-04 01:18:58		For example, as far as I noticed, the Physician's medical school name is pretty organised, but pubmed affiliations seem to have lot of redundant names.
2018-03-04 01:18:58		In this method, we can convert the physician's medical school name to an array and check if all the elements of the array is in pubmed affiliation. If so, we can assure that they both are the same person. 
2018-03-04 01:18:58		What do you think about this? 
2018-03-04 01:22:05	Arun	And for us to match physicians data from pubmed and physician data, the fastest method would be to put it in a DB and then querying it. 
2018-03-04 09:12:58	jesse	Hey Arun, I agree that the pubmed data is scattered and that the physician data is more organized and condensed. however, I dont think it will be enough to just check if the physician med school is in the affiliation.
2018-03-04 09:12:58		Have you taken a look at certain schools that would and would not match under this scenario? If you have, and you are comfortable with the results that gives, then sure... but im thinking we may need to worry about ngrams and abbreviations.
2018-03-04 09:12:58		Ive been trying to compile a list of all schools contained in the pubmed data and sort them, but it's been running for twelve hours and I dont think itll finish. maybe i should try a much smaller dataset.. 
2018-03-04 09:18:25	jesse	I've got a list  of the affiliations that came from diseases beginning with X-Z 
2018-03-04 09:19:24	jesse	maybe we can use that and the list of med schools from the physician data to help us determine a good matching system. 
2018-03-04 09:30:50	jesse	I also had Sagar working a lil bit on this. I gave him a list of 400 med school names that came from the physician data and had him make abbreviations for each one. (i hope he wrote a program to do this lol) 
2018-03-04 12:00:15	Arun	Right, and for matching two med school names, I can probably write a script that would take care of abbreviations too. It will be very similar to the script I wrote for comparing names in any order 
2018-03-04 12:06:22	jesse	ok. if you can, try to make it so that we arent loading the entire CSVs into the script.
2018-03-04 12:06:22		many of these files are gigabytes of text, so we will run out of memory if we do that. 
2018-03-04 12:15:54	Arun	Right, well I?m sure of how to do that part. Like, I can read from the CSV and for each line in the CSV, I will have to read from the physician?s CSV. But, in this way, for each ?row? in the pubmed, I will be reading all the rows from the physician CSV, every time. 
2018-03-04 12:15:54		Is there any other way that you know of? 
2018-03-04 12:16:11	Arun	I mean, I?m *not sure of how to do that part 
2018-03-04 12:30:35	jesse	I'm not sure either. 
2018-03-04 12:39:42	jesse	I'm gonna try to filter out the duplicates out of the pubmed data once again and see what the file size is. 
2018-03-04 12:56:03	jesse	Are you working on raredx stuff right now? 
2018-03-04 12:58:02	Arun	I'm guessing the best way to go forward would be to put it on a DB and query data. 
2018-03-04 12:58:52	Arun	Anyway, I am not working on it right now. 
2018-03-04 13:07:09	jesse	put what specifically on the db? 
2018-03-04 13:07:34	Arun	Both, the pubmed data and the physician data. Instead of having it on a CSV 
2018-03-04 13:09:25	Arun	Do you believe our searching would be faster that way? 
2018-03-04 13:15:59	jesse	I'm not sure it would matter. once pandas loads it into memory, it doesn't matter. if you were thinking of doing some sort of join statement or some python thing that worked directly with psql, then it would be faster. 
2018-03-04 15:08:59	Arun	Yeah, thats true too, alright then 
2018-03-04 20:08:59	jesse	arun, do you have a script for the medschool comparison? 
2018-03-04 21:03:00	Arun	Hey, I will send you in sometime, like half hour? I am on my way home now from outside 
2018-03-04 21:03:51	jesse	sounds good 
2018-03-04 22:23:18	Arun	Hi Jesse :slightly_smiling_face: 
2018-03-04 22:24:51	Arun	Can I send the script here? 
2018-03-04 22:27:56	Arun	@Arun uploaded a file: https://ncstateuniversityitng.slack.com/files/U95TJ10M9/F9JFZ3Z45/comparemednames.py (compareMedNames.py) and commented: Script that compares Medical School Names from pubmed data and physcian data 
2018-03-04 22:30:22	Arun	I ran this script by taking names manually form the pubmed csv and the physician data. And it worked fine for the names I used. 
2018-03-04 22:31:42	Arun	I wouldn't say this script works very fine.  There will definitely be some good amount of false positive. But since we are already comparing the names, and this is more like a second factor to affirm our decision if two persons are the same, I'm hoping this would work fine. 
2018-03-04 22:36:20	Arun	@Arun uploaded a file: https://ncstateuniversityitng.slack.com/files/U95TJ10M9/F9JBS09T6/pip_package_for_fuzzywuzzy.txt (pip package for fuzzywuzzy) and commented: Forgot to mention, you need to install the fuzzywuzzy package for this. 
2018-03-04 23:04:26	jesse	I'll take a look tomorrow. i appreciate it dude. i tried to run a script tonight but my computer froze again.... these files are just too big :( 
2018-03-05 00:21:37	Arun	Ah, I see. Yeah please run it tomorrow and let me know how it runs against our data. :slightly_smiling_face: Thanks Jesse 
2018-03-05 00:21:58	Arun	And also, do you want my script for name comparison as well? 
2018-03-05 07:13:07	jesse	yes plz. anything would help. 
2018-03-05 10:25:10	Arun	Okay, I will slightly modify whatever I?ve coded and send you in sometime. 
2018-03-05 10:25:10		I?m not working on it right now, but I?ll send you! Is that okay? 
2018-03-05 10:25:36	jesse	yeah. 
2018-03-05 10:25:40	jesse	Thanks 
2018-03-05 16:44:45	Arun	@Arun uploaded a file: https://ncstateuniversityitng.slack.com/files/U95TJ10M9/F9JBZ2HND/comparenames.py (compareNames.py) 
2018-03-06 14:54:17	Arun	Hey Jesse, I am so sorry, I have an important interview this Thursday and thus I am unable to work on it, as I have to prepare myself for the interview. I hope you understand and its alright. I will be back only by Thursday night. 
2018-03-06 14:56:03	jesse	yeah I got you. just means more money for me :stuck_out_tongue: 
2018-03-06 14:56:44	jesse	I might get Michael or meaghan to help code some of this up too. xD 
2018-03-08 18:51:24	Arun	Hi Jesse. 
2018-03-08 18:51:30	Arun	How you doing? 
2018-03-08 18:51:57	Arun	Is there anything that you want me to work on? I can work on it tomorrow 
2018-03-08 19:34:53	jesse	hey dude. ya know that list, YetAnotherMedicalSchoolList? 
2018-03-08 19:41:28	jesse	I would like the medical schools, all 404 of them  to have which state that they came from. This will be a big help with the comparisons.
2018-03-08 19:41:28		right now, I only have a program that gets the NC comparisons. this was done for the sake of efficiency... the program as it is takes 30 mins to run. with all 50 states, its gonna take 24 hours if we generate sql statements for all of them.... this is still far better than the estimated 600 days that a nested for loop would cause. 
2018-03-08 19:42:18	jesse	and I'm doing alright. i needed to run the pubmed data once more which kinda sucks. 
2018-03-09 02:45:49	Arun	YetAnotherMedicalSchoolList? I am not aware of that list 
2018-03-09 03:11:18	Arun	Oh, we have created all the databases now? 
2018-03-09 08:01:13	jesse	oh sorry i mustve spoken to sagar about that one 
2018-03-09 08:02:08	jesse	we dont have all the databases now since i got one generating right now. its the pubmed junk again. 
2018-03-09 08:03:20	jesse	YetAnotherMedicalSchoolList is something where I took all of the specialists medical schools and filtered out all the duplicates. its in the google drive 
2018-03-09 08:04:01	jesse	there were a few different lists of medical schools at this point, so thats what I decided to call it. 
2018-03-09 08:12:22	jesse	I've also got a program for checking for matches in the med schools. we need that program to match as many as possible without doing something complex like n grams... i think. if we do the ngrams, our program will take forever to run... although it may be feasible for just NC. 
2018-03-09 08:13:02	jesse	if you'd like to try to upgrade that program, feel free. 
2018-03-09 08:18:48	jesse	if you want to see those 2 programs, theyre in power6a under/home/jlsimps4/ForTheGreatAndPowerfulMichael/
2018-03-09 08:18:48		since michael was wanting to look into them.
2018-03-09 08:18:48		they require a database for the specialists and the pubmed stuff, so you can find those csvs in the ForMeaghan folder... to convert between the two, you can just use a psql \copy statement 
2018-03-09 19:23:01	Arun	Hey Jesse, I?m just checking out your messages. So comparing med schools, you have written a separate script? 
2018-03-09 19:24:02	Arun	And, you took the YetAnotherMedicalSchoolList from the already available specialist data ( that website you sent me previously) , I believe? 
2018-03-09 19:34:00	jesse	yep. the scripts are in the pubmed-crawler folder in the rarediseases repo 
2018-03-09 19:35:33	Arun	Okay I will look into it!  
2018-03-09 19:36:58	Arun	So, you want me to do which state does these universities/medical school come from eh?  
2018-03-09 19:38:46	jesse	yeah. preferably the two letter code. NC for north carolina. I asked sagar to look at the same thing so you may want to message him. And maybe put messages in the patientportalpeeps channel since I've had to repeat myself for both you and Sagar. 
2018-03-10 15:18:08	Arun	Alright I will talk to Sagar and check where he is 
2018-03-10 21:39:13	Arun	Hey. I checked with Sagar, he said he is good with doing that part. So, is there something else I could work on?  
2018-03-10 21:40:53	jesse	have you seen the script for the medschool comparisons ? 
2018-03-10 21:51:09	jesse	There are 2, getPhysicianPubmedConnection.py and compareMedSchools.py
2018-03-10 21:51:09		We are no longer deleting the duplicates from the pubmed dataset because we are keeping the disease ids with the articles... What this means is that it will take longer for the program  to run. We need to make it more efficient if possible.
2018-03-10 21:51:09		As for the second file, we need to do whatever we can to get more medical schools to match... this could be achieved by doing Ngrams or by removing more nonsense words. 
2018-03-10 21:51:09		and last of all, you can check if Janne needs help with the drug companies. I havent heard back from her.
2018-03-10 21:51:09		That is all I would know to do. There are also some issues you could look into on github. 
2018-03-10 21:55:19	jesse	Also stuff about Mesh terms when gathering the pubmed data... but I think we should hold off on that until we figure out  how to get these comparisons efficiently. [:+1:1] 
2018-03-11 14:39:29	Arun	I did check those scripts recently, but I will do go through it again today or tomorrow, to start looking into it. I will look at the compareMedSchools.py and see what we can we do it make it match better. 
2018-03-11 14:40:21	Arun	And yes, I will check with Janne too, and see if she is doing okay. 
2018-04-12 13:45:44	jesse	Hey Arun, in the meeting today, it seemed like you finished whatever you were doing, and the team wanted you to help me out with researching the Alternative Medicines. We don't really have any leads on that, just need to find out what sources are good for that and what we can scrape. 
2018-04-12 13:46:20	Arun	Hi Jesse, I was just about to ping you regarding the same  
2018-04-12 13:46:59	Arun	So, I need to look out for data on alternative medicines? 
2018-04-12 13:49:41	jesse	yep. do google searches, or whatever you can to build up a list of websites that we can scrape data from. 
2018-04-12 13:49:58	Arun	Yes, I can do that  
2018-04-12 13:51:01	jesse	I'll be doing the same thing, so let me know if you find anything, and I will let you know if I find anything. If we find something good enough to scrape, then we can focus on that, but for now, lets just get links. 
2018-04-12 16:30:38		getting channel history...
2018-02-16 19:17:25	jesse	also, the csv name at the bottom will be changed. Its the contractors one now because I was copying and pasting stuff 
2018-02-16 19:18:07	jesse	My current issue is that I would like to get a date out of the article. 
2018-02-16 19:22:18	Arun	Great, that is perfect!  
2018-02-16 19:22:36	Arun	Is there any significance for the date field? 
2018-02-16 19:23:13	Arun	Other than just to sort the articles chronologically? 
2018-02-16 19:27:21	jesse	not really. My thinking was just that a date might be nice to have. If 2 articles are about the same rare_dx, then maybe the newer one might be more credible. but this would just be a side objective. A better solution is to find some sort of id field, since we already have a table in a database for pubmed stuff. (the problem with that table is that it only has the first initial of the last name or first name.) 
2018-02-16 19:30:15	Arun	Oh, I see. Where exactly is that database? In that http://power6.ncsu.edu (power6.ncsu.edu) machine? I mean, is there any other databases that we have? 
2018-02-16 19:32:21	jesse	on power6a in ncbi database 
2018-02-16 19:32:35	Arun	Okay okay cool. 
2018-02-16 19:33:19	Arun	And yeah, I am going through the script that you uploaded now. And I will also take a look at what Janne and Sagar has done 
2018-02-16 19:34:01	jesse	this was built off of what sagar did. I'm not sure Janne had anything worth pushing 
2018-02-16 19:37:20	jesse	the table for the pubmed rare diseases should not be counted on. it only has 1000 rows. I think we will have to create our own. 
2018-02-16 19:37:51	jesse	and they didn't even store date :disappointed: 
2018-02-16 19:41:47	Arun	Oh I see. Anyway, we do have the APIs to get the data right? For pubmed 
2018-02-16 19:42:12	jesse	thats what the Bio package at the top is. 
2018-02-16 19:42:28	Arun	Yeah right. Okay cool!  
2018-02-16 19:42:30	jesse	we basically have the data, but its kinda a blobby dictionary thats hard to get through 
2018-02-16 19:42:56	Arun	Ah, like that! Alright, got it  
2018-02-16 19:44:55	jesse	ok i got the date. I'm gonna push again if ya don't mind. 
2018-02-16 19:46:21	Arun	But anyway, if required, can we meet once on Sunday? Only if you are free  
2018-02-16 19:46:30	Arun	Awesome :grin: 
2018-02-16 19:46:38	jesse	yup. 
2018-02-16 19:47:37	jesse	ok i pushed the stuff. 
2018-02-16 19:47:41	Arun	So, I?ll go through everything and see if I?m able to understand everything that we?ve got! And Sunday I?ll ask you the questions if I have any, and we can probably sit together and get done with this part!  
2018-02-16 19:48:50	jesse	Sounds good. 
2018-02-17 21:28:14	Arun	Hey Jesse, Will you be free post lunch tomorrow? 
2018-02-18 07:54:57	jesse	yeah 
2018-02-18 11:11:16	Arun	Great, shall we meet at 4pm today then? For about 1-2 hours maximum  
2018-02-18 11:20:23	jesse	Sounds good. I've been doing quite a bit of work to this script. for the most part, I just need to let you know what my current code gathers, the errors I'm running into, what needs to be done with the outputted CSV files, and stuff like that. My thinking is after we meet at 4, I can hand the rest of the work concerning pubmed stuff to you, and I can then switch to working on the drug company data and some of the other minor tasks. 
2018-02-18 14:38:33	Arun	Sure, I?ll be in Hunt grad commons. I?ve booked room number 4314  
2018-02-18 14:39:18	jesse	can undergrads go there? 
2018-02-18 14:40:01	Arun	Ah, I totally forgot about that! But I guess you can come inside if I'm with you 
2018-02-18 14:41:52	jesse	ok. are you there now or should i wait till 4? 
2018-02-18 14:42:16	Arun	I am here in library. We can meet now, sure! But the room is available only from 4 
2018-02-18 14:42:40	Arun	So, if you can find another room, I sure can come 
2018-02-18 14:46:44	jesse	I just checked. there is no room available that I can reserve.  
2018-02-18 14:47:03	Arun	Yeah, that's what I thought too! 
2018-02-18 14:47:29	Arun	Anyway, we can still meet now if you wish 
2018-02-18 14:52:32	jesse	sure. I'm just laying in my bed anyway. give me a few minutes to finish the current csv my computer is workin on and so I can make tea /get ready to leave 
2018-02-18 14:52:56	Arun	Yeah sure, take your time! :slightly_smiling_face: 
2018-02-18 15:03:18	jesse	im at the library now 
2018-02-18 15:03:46	Arun	Oh good. Can you come to 4th floor? I'll come near the lift 
2018-02-18 18:36:25	jesse	Did you specify in LibreOffice that the CSV's were comma separated when you opened it? 
2018-02-18 18:36:50	jesse	usually it says "separate by [] comma  [] semicolon [] space... etc 
2018-02-18 18:37:18	jesse	In the big CSV, I'm getting no entries that are overflowing. 
2018-02-18 18:39:05	jesse	Same with the little csv 
2018-02-18 18:40:22	Arun	Ah really? Damn, I didn?t notice that! But yeah, the next time I open it I?ll check that too 
2018-02-18 18:44:23	jesse	I'm gonna run the entire thing once more to try to locate the XML parsing error. hopefully I'll be able to narrow it down to a place and put a try/except thing around it to just skip the document if it fails to parse. 
2018-02-18 18:44:56	jesse	If you already have that stacktrace in your terminal, could you check the line number? 
2018-02-18 18:50:04	jesse	i think i'll just put an except around the search/query part. my guess is thats where the issue is. 
2018-02-18 18:58:01	Arun	Gimme sometime, I?ll check and let you know the line number  
2018-02-18 19:27:34	Arun	My new CSV is being generated now, and I cannot check back the stacktrace 
2018-02-18 19:27:51	jesse	thats ok. I've got a CSV generating myself. 
2018-02-18 19:28:38	jesse	quick trick: if you run "tmux" you can detach the terminal so that you can close out of the terminal and do other things while the program is being run in the background. [:+1:1 :heavy_check_mark:1] 
2018-02-18 21:16:47	jesse	I got the full csv and it's beautiful 
2018-02-18 21:17:20	jesse	i mean, its what you'd expect... a csv, but I've been working quite hard just to get it lol 
2018-02-18 21:23:57	jesse	also, I don't think I pulled your changes, since you removed the fun stuff like abstract and title 
2018-02-19 18:23:21	jesse	Hey Arun, you have yurika working on your computer right? 
2018-02-19 18:23:45	jesse	Janne was wanting to use it for getting info on drug companies. 
2018-02-19 20:40:41	Arun	Hey yeah, I have it in Running! Sorry, for the late reply  
2018-02-19 20:41:27	Arun	Janne wants to use it? Sure, we can try using it. But the websites that we use should allow crawling  
2018-02-19 20:42:18	jesse	cool. I'm not sure what Janne needs. I was working with her tonight and the drug company information is chaos. I'll try to ask Janne and get her to message 
2018-02-19 20:42:19	jesse	you 
2018-02-19 20:42:35	Arun	Or I can ping Janne right away and save some time :)  
2018-02-19 20:43:08	jesse	cool! I hope it works out. 
2018-02-19 20:43:22	Arun	Alright, pinged her now!  
2018-02-19 20:44:11	jesse	Thanks dude. i tried it on my computer but i think postgresql is forever broke on my computer from trying to mess with agensgraph 
2018-02-19 20:44:58	Arun	Ah, I see! Alright, not an issue! Let?s see if we are able to get the data using Yurika  
2018-02-26 12:51:32	Arun	Hey Jesse, I just realized that I have some work for today evening. Is it alright if we push today's meeting to tomorrow? 
2018-02-26 12:58:37	jesse	i guess that depends on everyone else. i could probably meet both today and tomorrow and not run out of things to do. 
2018-02-26 12:59:04	Arun	Okay, If others are making it, I'll try to make it too! 
2018-02-26 12:59:56	jesse	ok. if not, I can just let you know what happens, whether its by text or meeting up tomorrow. 
2018-02-26 13:00:39	Arun	Alright, that's great! I'll keep you posted :slightly_smiling_face: 
2018-02-27 09:06:59	jesse	Hey Arun, I met up with Sagar last night, and Janne separately. we've got a few issues with the pubmed stuff.
2018-02-27 09:06:59		I'll give ya a quick run down:
2018-02-27 09:06:59		our pubmed data filtered everyone who were affiliated with medical schools in NC
2018-02-27 09:06:59		our specialist data filtered everyone whos hospital was in NC.
2018-02-27 09:06:59		issue 1.   many people work in NC hospitals and have their medical degrees from places outside of NC.
2018-02-27 09:06:59		but lets ignore that for now.
2018-02-27 09:06:59		issue 2. the medical schools in the pubmed data is not uniform with the specialists data for schools they came from. matching UNC Chapel Hill would be fairly easy since Chapel Hill is unique... but take North Carolina State University... filter out the unnecessary words like "north carolina" and "university" and your left with ..."state"... which doesnt help. also consider that many pubmed researchers dont seem to be affiliated with a university or school of medicine... but rather just a lab...
2018-02-27 09:06:59		Back to Issue 1. If we want to fix this, we would be looking to scrape all of the pubmed data  rather than just NC (an estimated 300hr process with extra hours for filtering duplicates.)   alternatively, we could just  not filter the specialists at all but this comes with its own risks. (still preferable but it leads us back to issue 2.)
2018-02-27 09:06:59		As for Janne, she's been working hard scraping the drug company data. sadly a good amount of her work  must be done manually. 
2018-02-27 15:29:47	Arun	Hey Jesse, just seeing your message now. Thanks for the update! 
2018-02-27 15:31:00	Arun	Regarding issue 1, we can try to write a write to check if we are getting data properly, say upto 1000 or 10000 rows. Once we are sure about the script, we can request a machine to Meaghan and we can run our script in that machine, instead of running in our personal machine 
2018-02-27 15:42:01	jesse	that sounds reasonable, but it may be better if we could just download the entire pubmed data set rather than webscraping: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/databases/download/pubmed_medline.html
2018-02-27 15:42:01		I'm not sure if this would be too much memory or not, but they also have daily update files so we wouldn't have to re-download it every time... we would just need a way to convert the xml to postgresql... [:+1:1] 
2018-02-27 15:48:34	Arun	Oh yeah, I didnt know we could download the data directly. 
2018-02-27 15:49:28	Arun	Btw, for this week I am yet to clock in and start working on specialist-disease relation 
2018-02-27 15:49:48	jesse	ya wanna task? 
2018-02-27 15:50:02	Arun	I've been busy with my stuff. I guess I will be able to work a maximum of only 8-10 hours this week and next week 
2018-02-27 15:50:53	Arun	I will try writing the script to manipulate the name according to the pubmed data and see if I can find matches 
2018-02-27 15:51:03	Arun	Once I am done with that work, I can work on other task 
2018-02-27 15:51:28	jesse	hold on with that. 
2018-02-27 15:51:46	Arun	Are you sure about it? 
2018-02-27 15:52:01	Arun	I can hold on it and work on something more important if there is any 
2018-02-27 15:54:13	jesse	part of this past meeting was that since we cannot just match first and last name, since many first names are not full names... So we wanted to link them to their universities. So if a person with the last name of Hayes went to Chapel Hill in pubmed, we could say that they are the same person who is listed in specialists as Hayes who went to Chapel Hill. Do ya follow? 
2018-02-27 15:54:49	Arun	Okay, I get it. Yeah, it makes sense 
2018-02-27 15:56:05	jesse	Also, If we download the entire pubmed thing... and somehow make it into a pubmed database, we will need to modify whatever script you were planning on writing. 
2018-02-27 15:56:28	Arun	But, Is it the only way to confirm if two persons are the same? Is there other possibilities to confirm that. I was thinking something like, if the name is Mathew Hayes and we have M Hayes, chances that they both are same is quite high, whats your thought on that? 
2018-02-27 15:58:23	jesse	we could check firstname too... but ideally we would want M Hayes from Chapel Hill === Mathew Hayes from Chapel Hill... If we are opening up all of pubmed to all of the specialists in the united states... then first and last name is no longer accurate enough.. since there are a ton of mathew hayes from the united states whereas maybe not so much with just NC. 
2018-02-27 15:58:50	Arun	Yeah agreed! 
2018-02-27 16:00:22	Arun	But since there are way too many pubmed data and too many specialists too, the computation could take more time when we start comparing different fields simulatenously, I thought. 
2018-02-27 16:00:22		But nevertheless, what you said would definitely work :slightly_smiling_face: 
2018-02-27 16:04:28	jesse	it would take more time, but it would maybe be a couple hour process just from a rough estimate i think 
2018-02-27 16:04:46	jesse	I'll still need to confirm with Kowolenko before we actually try to do this [:+1:1] 
2018-02-27 16:25:19	Arun	Yeah thats right. And Okay, so meanwhile what do you want me to work on? 
2018-02-27 16:28:18	jesse	I think you should look into trying to find a way to compare the medical school names and see if the medical school names in the specialists match with the pubmed affiliations. 
2018-02-27 16:40:26	Arun	Okay, I will look at that today and let you know when I am done with it 
2018-02-27 16:41:25	jesse	xD I wouldn't expect you to be done with it. but let me know what your thinking about that problem. Also figured we should clarify that for the specialists, we are referring to the data from http://medicare.gov (medicare.gov) rather than the other specialist data we gathered. 
2018-02-27 16:43:07	Arun	Ahh, I see. Alright. I will look into that website and see what data we've got. And yeah, I will let you know my thoughts before I actually start coding it 
2018-02-27 16:46:31	jesse	https://data.medicare.gov/Physician-Compare/Physician-Compare-National-Downloadable-File/mj5m-pzi6

[:heavy_check_mark:1 :+1:1 :slightly_smiling_face:1] 
2018-02-27 20:13:11	jesse	Hey Arun, have you been working on that problem? ^^ 
2018-02-27 20:13:48	Arun	Not yet Jesse, I was planning to look at it tonight post dinner 
2018-02-27 20:14:50	jesse	ahh I gotcha. I was just wonderin. I'm trying to decide what I wanna do, whether it's eat dinner, work on this, or go back to my apartment and play a video game :stuck_out_tongue: 
2018-02-27 20:38:51	Arun	Haha, sometime  of video game wouldn't hurt anything I believe! :smile: 
2018-02-27 21:09:54	jesse	sadly I chose to work on another project :disappointed: 
2018-02-28 13:25:40	Arun	Hey Jesse, afternoon! So, I checked out the website and also the pubmed data. What you said makes sense. 
2018-02-28 13:25:40		And once we make all the necessary calculations, we could probably try to sort the list with current NC specialist coming on the top and then in the order of nearest states wrt NC 
2018-02-28 13:26:39	Arun	But we are expected to finish all this by next thursday? 
2018-02-28 13:29:05	jesse	did you read the messages on the rarediseases channel? 
2018-02-28 13:29:16	Arun	Yes I did 
2018-02-28 13:29:29	Arun	I just checked out the messages there 
2018-02-28 13:32:14	jesse	i gotcha. yeah we are supposed to have something to show off by next thursday. I'm thinking the only truly difficult task we will have to deal with is comparing the names of the medical schools.  If we have to download all of the pubmed data, we will have a lot more troubles, which is why I'm going to try to run the script without the NC filter and see if it takes significantly more time or not. 
2018-02-28 13:34:42	Arun	Okay that would be a start. Do you want us to meet anytime this week or weekend? I fear I won't be available next week starting Monday :disappointed: 
2018-02-28 13:35:34	jesse	I'm going to charlotte starting thursday night up until next sunday... I won't be able to meet. I can do google hangouts though... but thats not as helpful 
2018-02-28 13:37:12	Arun	Ah, I see. Alright then, we will figure it out. But let's split up the work and finish it off as much as possible. 
2018-02-28 13:38:05	Arun	One question, why do you want to strip out the University names? Like, you were saying NC State University will result in 'state' which is not of any use. But, why do we have to it? 
2018-02-28 13:44:01	jesse	agreed. I'll have more information tonight... so it'll be clearer what all we need to do by the meeting time tomorrow. No matter what though, we need to find a way to compare the University names.
2018-02-28 13:44:01		As for that, the names of the affiliations in the pubmed data are not the same as the medical schools in the specialists data. We need to find a way to connect people on first/lastname (easy) and then by the university... my thought was that we could strip away some of the meaningless words so that we could match the names of the schools... but that won't work for the above reason you mentioned. Ingrams aren't too great either since swapping North Carolina State University also could match University of North Carolina State.
2018-02-28 13:44:01		Don't get too fixated on things that I say. I'm just trying to get you to understand the problem.  If you can find a way to keep all of the words in and determine that two schools are the same, all power to ya. 
2018-02-28 13:47:57	Arun	Haha, agreed. I understand you are trying to explain me the problem. :slightly_smiling_face: 
2018-02-28 13:50:23	Arun	And alright, meanwhile, let me know if you need anything! 
2018-02-28 13:50:40	jesse	Sure thing. 
2018-03-01 14:03:57	jesse	I posted the notes/todo thing I made for the week. take a look at that and then you can ask me if you have any questions. 
2018-03-01 20:16:16	Arun	Hey, I just had a look at it now. 
2018-03-01 20:19:33	Arun	I see there are immediate stuffs to get done with regard to matching physicians with pubmed data. Will you be working on any task particularly? 
2018-03-01 21:17:22	jesse	i havent decided the order Ill start tackling these things yet. sorry i didnt respond. i was driving 
2018-03-01 21:18:27	Arun	No worries! :slightly_smiling_face: And, let me know how we can go about it, if you got any leads 
2018-03-04 01:18:58	Arun	Hey, so for comparing the affiliation from pubmed and physician's medical school name, we can probably just check if medical school name is present in pubmed affiliation. 
2018-03-04 01:18:58		For example, as far as I noticed, the Physician's medical school name is pretty organised, but pubmed affiliations seem to have lot of redundant names.
2018-03-04 01:18:58		In this method, we can convert the physician's medical school name to an array and check if all the elements of the array is in pubmed affiliation. If so, we can assure that they both are the same person. 
2018-03-04 01:18:58		What do you think about this? 
2018-03-04 01:22:05	Arun	And for us to match physicians data from pubmed and physician data, the fastest method would be to put it in a DB and then querying it. 
2018-03-04 09:12:58	jesse	Hey Arun, I agree that the pubmed data is scattered and that the physician data is more organized and condensed. however, I dont think it will be enough to just check if the physician med school is in the affiliation.
2018-03-04 09:12:58		Have you taken a look at certain schools that would and would not match under this scenario? If you have, and you are comfortable with the results that gives, then sure... but im thinking we may need to worry about ngrams and abbreviations.
2018-03-04 09:12:58		Ive been trying to compile a list of all schools contained in the pubmed data and sort them, but it's been running for twelve hours and I dont think itll finish. maybe i should try a much smaller dataset.. 
2018-03-04 09:18:25	jesse	I've got a list  of the affiliations that came from diseases beginning with X-Z 
2018-03-04 09:19:24	jesse	maybe we can use that and the list of med schools from the physician data to help us determine a good matching system. 
2018-03-04 09:30:50	jesse	I also had Sagar working a lil bit on this. I gave him a list of 400 med school names that came from the physician data and had him make abbreviations for each one. (i hope he wrote a program to do this lol) 
2018-03-04 12:00:15	Arun	Right, and for matching two med school names, I can probably write a script that would take care of abbreviations too. It will be very similar to the script I wrote for comparing names in any order 
2018-03-04 12:06:22	jesse	ok. if you can, try to make it so that we arent loading the entire CSVs into the script.
2018-03-04 12:06:22		many of these files are gigabytes of text, so we will run out of memory if we do that. 
2018-03-04 12:15:54	Arun	Right, well I?m sure of how to do that part. Like, I can read from the CSV and for each line in the CSV, I will have to read from the physician?s CSV. But, in this way, for each ?row? in the pubmed, I will be reading all the rows from the physician CSV, every time. 
2018-03-04 12:15:54		Is there any other way that you know of? 
2018-03-04 12:16:11	Arun	I mean, I?m *not sure of how to do that part 
2018-03-04 12:30:35	jesse	I'm not sure either. 
2018-03-04 12:39:42	jesse	I'm gonna try to filter out the duplicates out of the pubmed data once again and see what the file size is. 
2018-03-04 12:56:03	jesse	Are you working on raredx stuff right now? 
2018-03-04 12:58:02	Arun	I'm guessing the best way to go forward would be to put it on a DB and query data. 
2018-03-04 12:58:52	Arun	Anyway, I am not working on it right now. 
2018-03-04 13:07:09	jesse	put what specifically on the db? 
2018-03-04 13:07:34	Arun	Both, the pubmed data and the physician data. Instead of having it on a CSV 
2018-03-04 13:09:25	Arun	Do you believe our searching would be faster that way? 
2018-03-04 13:15:59	jesse	I'm not sure it would matter. once pandas loads it into memory, it doesn't matter. if you were thinking of doing some sort of join statement or some python thing that worked directly with psql, then it would be faster. 
2018-03-04 15:08:59	Arun	Yeah, thats true too, alright then 
2018-03-04 20:08:59	jesse	arun, do you have a script for the medschool comparison? 
2018-03-04 21:03:00	Arun	Hey, I will send you in sometime, like half hour? I am on my way home now from outside 
2018-03-04 21:03:51	jesse	sounds good 
2018-03-04 22:23:18	Arun	Hi Jesse :slightly_smiling_face: 
2018-03-04 22:24:51	Arun	Can I send the script here? 
2018-03-04 22:27:56	Arun	@Arun uploaded a file: https://ncstateuniversityitng.slack.com/files/U95TJ10M9/F9JFZ3Z45/comparemednames.py (compareMedNames.py) and commented: Script that compares Medical School Names from pubmed data and physcian data 
2018-03-04 22:30:22	Arun	I ran this script by taking names manually form the pubmed csv and the physician data. And it worked fine for the names I used. 
2018-03-04 22:31:42	Arun	I wouldn't say this script works very fine.  There will definitely be some good amount of false positive. But since we are already comparing the names, and this is more like a second factor to affirm our decision if two persons are the same, I'm hoping this would work fine. 
2018-03-04 22:36:20	Arun	@Arun uploaded a file: https://ncstateuniversityitng.slack.com/files/U95TJ10M9/F9JBS09T6/pip_package_for_fuzzywuzzy.txt (pip package for fuzzywuzzy) and commented: Forgot to mention, you need to install the fuzzywuzzy package for this. 
2018-03-04 23:04:26	jesse	I'll take a look tomorrow. i appreciate it dude. i tried to run a script tonight but my computer froze again.... these files are just too big :( 
2018-03-05 00:21:37	Arun	Ah, I see. Yeah please run it tomorrow and let me know how it runs against our data. :slightly_smiling_face: Thanks Jesse 
2018-03-05 00:21:58	Arun	And also, do you want my script for name comparison as well? 
2018-03-05 07:13:07	jesse	yes plz. anything would help. 
2018-03-05 10:25:10	Arun	Okay, I will slightly modify whatever I?ve coded and send you in sometime. 
2018-03-05 10:25:10		I?m not working on it right now, but I?ll send you! Is that okay? 
2018-03-05 10:25:36	jesse	yeah. 
2018-03-05 10:25:40	jesse	Thanks 
2018-03-05 16:44:45	Arun	@Arun uploaded a file: https://ncstateuniversityitng.slack.com/files/U95TJ10M9/F9JBZ2HND/comparenames.py (compareNames.py) 
2018-03-06 14:54:17	Arun	Hey Jesse, I am so sorry, I have an important interview this Thursday and thus I am unable to work on it, as I have to prepare myself for the interview. I hope you understand and its alright. I will be back only by Thursday night. 
2018-03-06 14:56:03	jesse	yeah I got you. just means more money for me :stuck_out_tongue: 
2018-03-06 14:56:44	jesse	I might get Michael or meaghan to help code some of this up too. xD 
2018-03-08 18:51:24	Arun	Hi Jesse. 
2018-03-08 18:51:30	Arun	How you doing? 
2018-03-08 18:51:57	Arun	Is there anything that you want me to work on? I can work on it tomorrow 
2018-03-08 19:34:53	jesse	hey dude. ya know that list, YetAnotherMedicalSchoolList? 
2018-03-08 19:41:28	jesse	I would like the medical schools, all 404 of them  to have which state that they came from. This will be a big help with the comparisons.
2018-03-08 19:41:28		right now, I only have a program that gets the NC comparisons. this was done for the sake of efficiency... the program as it is takes 30 mins to run. with all 50 states, its gonna take 24 hours if we generate sql statements for all of them.... this is still far better than the estimated 600 days that a nested for loop would cause. 
2018-03-08 19:42:18	jesse	and I'm doing alright. i needed to run the pubmed data once more which kinda sucks. 
2018-03-09 02:45:49	Arun	YetAnotherMedicalSchoolList? I am not aware of that list 
2018-03-09 03:11:18	Arun	Oh, we have created all the databases now? 
2018-03-09 08:01:13	jesse	oh sorry i mustve spoken to sagar about that one 
2018-03-09 08:02:08	jesse	we dont have all the databases now since i got one generating right now. its the pubmed junk again. 
2018-03-09 08:03:20	jesse	YetAnotherMedicalSchoolList is something where I took all of the specialists medical schools and filtered out all the duplicates. its in the google drive 
2018-03-09 08:04:01	jesse	there were a few different lists of medical schools at this point, so thats what I decided to call it. 
2018-03-09 08:12:22	jesse	I've also got a program for checking for matches in the med schools. we need that program to match as many as possible without doing something complex like n grams... i think. if we do the ngrams, our program will take forever to run... although it may be feasible for just NC. 
2018-03-09 08:13:02	jesse	if you'd like to try to upgrade that program, feel free. 
2018-03-09 08:18:48	jesse	if you want to see those 2 programs, theyre in power6a under/home/jlsimps4/ForTheGreatAndPowerfulMichael/
2018-03-09 08:18:48		since michael was wanting to look into them.
2018-03-09 08:18:48		they require a database for the specialists and the pubmed stuff, so you can find those csvs in the ForMeaghan folder... to convert between the two, you can just use a psql \copy statement 
2018-03-09 19:23:01	Arun	Hey Jesse, I?m just checking out your messages. So comparing med schools, you have written a separate script? 
2018-03-09 19:24:02	Arun	And, you took the YetAnotherMedicalSchoolList from the already available specialist data ( that website you sent me previously) , I believe? 
2018-03-09 19:34:00	jesse	yep. the scripts are in the pubmed-crawler folder in the rarediseases repo 
2018-03-09 19:35:33	Arun	Okay I will look into it!  
2018-03-09 19:36:58	Arun	So, you want me to do which state does these universities/medical school come from eh?  
2018-03-09 19:38:46	jesse	yeah. preferably the two letter code. NC for north carolina. I asked sagar to look at the same thing so you may want to message him. And maybe put messages in the patientportalpeeps channel since I've had to repeat myself for both you and Sagar. 
2018-03-10 15:18:08	Arun	Alright I will talk to Sagar and check where he is 
2018-03-10 21:39:13	Arun	Hey. I checked with Sagar, he said he is good with doing that part. So, is there something else I could work on?  
2018-03-10 21:40:53	jesse	have you seen the script for the medschool comparisons ? 
2018-03-10 21:51:09	jesse	There are 2, getPhysicianPubmedConnection.py and compareMedSchools.py
2018-03-10 21:51:09		We are no longer deleting the duplicates from the pubmed dataset because we are keeping the disease ids with the articles... What this means is that it will take longer for the program  to run. We need to make it more efficient if possible.
2018-03-10 21:51:09		As for the second file, we need to do whatever we can to get more medical schools to match... this could be achieved by doing Ngrams or by removing more nonsense words. 
2018-03-10 21:51:09		and last of all, you can check if Janne needs help with the drug companies. I havent heard back from her.
2018-03-10 21:51:09		That is all I would know to do. There are also some issues you could look into on github. 
2018-03-10 21:55:19	jesse	Also stuff about Mesh terms when gathering the pubmed data... but I think we should hold off on that until we figure out  how to get these comparisons efficiently. [:+1:1] 
2018-03-11 14:39:29	Arun	I did check those scripts recently, but I will do go through it again today or tomorrow, to start looking into it. I will look at the compareMedSchools.py and see what we can we do it make it match better. 
2018-03-11 14:40:21	Arun	And yes, I will check with Janne too, and see if she is doing okay. 
2018-04-12 13:45:44	jesse	Hey Arun, in the meeting today, it seemed like you finished whatever you were doing, and the team wanted you to help me out with researching the Alternative Medicines. We don't really have any leads on that, just need to find out what sources are good for that and what we can scrape. 
2018-04-12 13:46:20	Arun	Hi Jesse, I was just about to ping you regarding the same  
2018-04-12 13:46:59	Arun	So, I need to look out for data on alternative medicines? 
2018-04-12 13:49:41	jesse	yep. do google searches, or whatever you can to build up a list of websites that we can scrape data from. 
2018-04-12 13:49:58	Arun	Yes, I can do that  
2018-04-12 13:51:01	jesse	I'll be doing the same thing, so let me know if you find anything, and I will let you know if I find anything. If we find something good enough to scrape, then we can focus on that, but for now, lets just get links. 
2018-04-12 15:08:33	Arun	Okaaay sure, sounds good  
2018-04-14 17:17:28		getting channel history...
2018-02-16 19:17:25	jesse	also, the csv name at the bottom will be changed. Its the contractors one now because I was copying and pasting stuff 
2018-02-16 19:18:07	jesse	My current issue is that I would like to get a date out of the article. 
2018-02-16 19:22:18	Arun	Great, that is perfect!  
2018-02-16 19:22:36	Arun	Is there any significance for the date field? 
2018-02-16 19:23:13	Arun	Other than just to sort the articles chronologically? 
2018-02-16 19:27:21	jesse	not really. My thinking was just that a date might be nice to have. If 2 articles are about the same rare_dx, then maybe the newer one might be more credible. but this would just be a side objective. A better solution is to find some sort of id field, since we already have a table in a database for pubmed stuff. (the problem with that table is that it only has the first initial of the last name or first name.) 
2018-02-16 19:30:15	Arun	Oh, I see. Where exactly is that database? In that http://power6.ncsu.edu (power6.ncsu.edu) machine? I mean, is there any other databases that we have? 
2018-02-16 19:32:21	jesse	on power6a in ncbi database 
2018-02-16 19:32:35	Arun	Okay okay cool. 
2018-02-16 19:33:19	Arun	And yeah, I am going through the script that you uploaded now. And I will also take a look at what Janne and Sagar has done 
2018-02-16 19:34:01	jesse	this was built off of what sagar did. I'm not sure Janne had anything worth pushing 
2018-02-16 19:37:20	jesse	the table for the pubmed rare diseases should not be counted on. it only has 1000 rows. I think we will have to create our own. 
2018-02-16 19:37:51	jesse	and they didn't even store date :disappointed: 
2018-02-16 19:41:47	Arun	Oh I see. Anyway, we do have the APIs to get the data right? For pubmed 
2018-02-16 19:42:12	jesse	thats what the Bio package at the top is. 
2018-02-16 19:42:28	Arun	Yeah right. Okay cool!  
2018-02-16 19:42:30	jesse	we basically have the data, but its kinda a blobby dictionary thats hard to get through 
2018-02-16 19:42:56	Arun	Ah, like that! Alright, got it  
2018-02-16 19:44:55	jesse	ok i got the date. I'm gonna push again if ya don't mind. 
2018-02-16 19:46:21	Arun	But anyway, if required, can we meet once on Sunday? Only if you are free  
2018-02-16 19:46:30	Arun	Awesome :grin: 
2018-02-16 19:46:38	jesse	yup. 
2018-02-16 19:47:37	jesse	ok i pushed the stuff. 
2018-02-16 19:47:41	Arun	So, I?ll go through everything and see if I?m able to understand everything that we?ve got! And Sunday I?ll ask you the questions if I have any, and we can probably sit together and get done with this part!  
2018-02-16 19:48:50	jesse	Sounds good. 
2018-02-17 21:28:14	Arun	Hey Jesse, Will you be free post lunch tomorrow? 
2018-02-18 07:54:57	jesse	yeah 
2018-02-18 11:11:16	Arun	Great, shall we meet at 4pm today then? For about 1-2 hours maximum  
2018-02-18 11:20:23	jesse	Sounds good. I've been doing quite a bit of work to this script. for the most part, I just need to let you know what my current code gathers, the errors I'm running into, what needs to be done with the outputted CSV files, and stuff like that. My thinking is after we meet at 4, I can hand the rest of the work concerning pubmed stuff to you, and I can then switch to working on the drug company data and some of the other minor tasks. 
2018-02-18 14:38:33	Arun	Sure, I?ll be in Hunt grad commons. I?ve booked room number 4314  
2018-02-18 14:39:18	jesse	can undergrads go there? 
2018-02-18 14:40:01	Arun	Ah, I totally forgot about that! But I guess you can come inside if I'm with you 
2018-02-18 14:41:52	jesse	ok. are you there now or should i wait till 4? 
2018-02-18 14:42:16	Arun	I am here in library. We can meet now, sure! But the room is available only from 4 
2018-02-18 14:42:40	Arun	So, if you can find another room, I sure can come 
2018-02-18 14:46:44	jesse	I just checked. there is no room available that I can reserve.  
2018-02-18 14:47:03	Arun	Yeah, that's what I thought too! 
2018-02-18 14:47:29	Arun	Anyway, we can still meet now if you wish 
2018-02-18 14:52:32	jesse	sure. I'm just laying in my bed anyway. give me a few minutes to finish the current csv my computer is workin on and so I can make tea /get ready to leave 
2018-02-18 14:52:56	Arun	Yeah sure, take your time! :slightly_smiling_face: 
2018-02-18 15:03:18	jesse	im at the library now 
2018-02-18 15:03:46	Arun	Oh good. Can you come to 4th floor? I'll come near the lift 
2018-02-18 18:36:25	jesse	Did you specify in LibreOffice that the CSV's were comma separated when you opened it? 
2018-02-18 18:36:50	jesse	usually it says "separate by [] comma  [] semicolon [] space... etc 
2018-02-18 18:37:18	jesse	In the big CSV, I'm getting no entries that are overflowing. 
2018-02-18 18:39:05	jesse	Same with the little csv 
2018-02-18 18:40:22	Arun	Ah really? Damn, I didn?t notice that! But yeah, the next time I open it I?ll check that too 
2018-02-18 18:44:23	jesse	I'm gonna run the entire thing once more to try to locate the XML parsing error. hopefully I'll be able to narrow it down to a place and put a try/except thing around it to just skip the document if it fails to parse. 
2018-02-18 18:44:56	jesse	If you already have that stacktrace in your terminal, could you check the line number? 
2018-02-18 18:50:04	jesse	i think i'll just put an except around the search/query part. my guess is thats where the issue is. 
2018-02-18 18:58:01	Arun	Gimme sometime, I?ll check and let you know the line number  
2018-02-18 19:27:34	Arun	My new CSV is being generated now, and I cannot check back the stacktrace 
2018-02-18 19:27:51	jesse	thats ok. I've got a CSV generating myself. 
2018-02-18 19:28:38	jesse	quick trick: if you run "tmux" you can detach the terminal so that you can close out of the terminal and do other things while the program is being run in the background. [:+1:1 :heavy_check_mark:1] 
2018-02-18 21:16:47	jesse	I got the full csv and it's beautiful 
2018-02-18 21:17:20	jesse	i mean, its what you'd expect... a csv, but I've been working quite hard just to get it lol 
2018-02-18 21:23:57	jesse	also, I don't think I pulled your changes, since you removed the fun stuff like abstract and title 
2018-02-19 18:23:21	jesse	Hey Arun, you have yurika working on your computer right? 
2018-02-19 18:23:45	jesse	Janne was wanting to use it for getting info on drug companies. 
2018-02-19 20:40:41	Arun	Hey yeah, I have it in Running! Sorry, for the late reply  
2018-02-19 20:41:27	Arun	Janne wants to use it? Sure, we can try using it. But the websites that we use should allow crawling  
2018-02-19 20:42:18	jesse	cool. I'm not sure what Janne needs. I was working with her tonight and the drug company information is chaos. I'll try to ask Janne and get her to message 
2018-02-19 20:42:19	jesse	you 
2018-02-19 20:42:35	Arun	Or I can ping Janne right away and save some time :)  
2018-02-19 20:43:08	jesse	cool! I hope it works out. 
2018-02-19 20:43:22	Arun	Alright, pinged her now!  
2018-02-19 20:44:11	jesse	Thanks dude. i tried it on my computer but i think postgresql is forever broke on my computer from trying to mess with agensgraph 
2018-02-19 20:44:58	Arun	Ah, I see! Alright, not an issue! Let?s see if we are able to get the data using Yurika  
2018-02-26 12:51:32	Arun	Hey Jesse, I just realized that I have some work for today evening. Is it alright if we push today's meeting to tomorrow? 
2018-02-26 12:58:37	jesse	i guess that depends on everyone else. i could probably meet both today and tomorrow and not run out of things to do. 
2018-02-26 12:59:04	Arun	Okay, If others are making it, I'll try to make it too! 
2018-02-26 12:59:56	jesse	ok. if not, I can just let you know what happens, whether its by text or meeting up tomorrow. 
2018-02-26 13:00:39	Arun	Alright, that's great! I'll keep you posted :slightly_smiling_face: 
2018-02-27 09:06:59	jesse	Hey Arun, I met up with Sagar last night, and Janne separately. we've got a few issues with the pubmed stuff.
2018-02-27 09:06:59		I'll give ya a quick run down:
2018-02-27 09:06:59		our pubmed data filtered everyone who were affiliated with medical schools in NC
2018-02-27 09:06:59		our specialist data filtered everyone whos hospital was in NC.
2018-02-27 09:06:59		issue 1.   many people work in NC hospitals and have their medical degrees from places outside of NC.
2018-02-27 09:06:59		but lets ignore that for now.
2018-02-27 09:06:59		issue 2. the medical schools in the pubmed data is not uniform with the specialists data for schools they came from. matching UNC Chapel Hill would be fairly easy since Chapel Hill is unique... but take North Carolina State University... filter out the unnecessary words like "north carolina" and "university" and your left with ..."state"... which doesnt help. also consider that many pubmed researchers dont seem to be affiliated with a university or school of medicine... but rather just a lab...
2018-02-27 09:06:59		Back to Issue 1. If we want to fix this, we would be looking to scrape all of the pubmed data  rather than just NC (an estimated 300hr process with extra hours for filtering duplicates.)   alternatively, we could just  not filter the specialists at all but this comes with its own risks. (still preferable but it leads us back to issue 2.)
2018-02-27 09:06:59		As for Janne, she's been working hard scraping the drug company data. sadly a good amount of her work  must be done manually. 
2018-02-27 15:29:47	Arun	Hey Jesse, just seeing your message now. Thanks for the update! 
2018-02-27 15:31:00	Arun	Regarding issue 1, we can try to write a write to check if we are getting data properly, say upto 1000 or 10000 rows. Once we are sure about the script, we can request a machine to Meaghan and we can run our script in that machine, instead of running in our personal machine 
2018-02-27 15:42:01	jesse	that sounds reasonable, but it may be better if we could just download the entire pubmed data set rather than webscraping: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/databases/download/pubmed_medline.html
2018-02-27 15:42:01		I'm not sure if this would be too much memory or not, but they also have daily update files so we wouldn't have to re-download it every time... we would just need a way to convert the xml to postgresql... [:+1:1] 
2018-02-27 15:48:34	Arun	Oh yeah, I didnt know we could download the data directly. 
2018-02-27 15:49:28	Arun	Btw, for this week I am yet to clock in and start working on specialist-disease relation 
2018-02-27 15:49:48	jesse	ya wanna task? 
2018-02-27 15:50:02	Arun	I've been busy with my stuff. I guess I will be able to work a maximum of only 8-10 hours this week and next week 
2018-02-27 15:50:53	Arun	I will try writing the script to manipulate the name according to the pubmed data and see if I can find matches 
2018-02-27 15:51:03	Arun	Once I am done with that work, I can work on other task 
2018-02-27 15:51:28	jesse	hold on with that. 
2018-02-27 15:51:46	Arun	Are you sure about it? 
2018-02-27 15:52:01	Arun	I can hold on it and work on something more important if there is any 
2018-02-27 15:54:13	jesse	part of this past meeting was that since we cannot just match first and last name, since many first names are not full names... So we wanted to link them to their universities. So if a person with the last name of Hayes went to Chapel Hill in pubmed, we could say that they are the same person who is listed in specialists as Hayes who went to Chapel Hill. Do ya follow? 
2018-02-27 15:54:49	Arun	Okay, I get it. Yeah, it makes sense 
2018-02-27 15:56:05	jesse	Also, If we download the entire pubmed thing... and somehow make it into a pubmed database, we will need to modify whatever script you were planning on writing. 
2018-02-27 15:56:28	Arun	But, Is it the only way to confirm if two persons are the same? Is there other possibilities to confirm that. I was thinking something like, if the name is Mathew Hayes and we have M Hayes, chances that they both are same is quite high, whats your thought on that? 
2018-02-27 15:58:23	jesse	we could check firstname too... but ideally we would want M Hayes from Chapel Hill === Mathew Hayes from Chapel Hill... If we are opening up all of pubmed to all of the specialists in the united states... then first and last name is no longer accurate enough.. since there are a ton of mathew hayes from the united states whereas maybe not so much with just NC. 
2018-02-27 15:58:50	Arun	Yeah agreed! 
2018-02-27 16:00:22	Arun	But since there are way too many pubmed data and too many specialists too, the computation could take more time when we start comparing different fields simulatenously, I thought. 
2018-02-27 16:00:22		But nevertheless, what you said would definitely work :slightly_smiling_face: 
2018-02-27 16:04:28	jesse	it would take more time, but it would maybe be a couple hour process just from a rough estimate i think 
2018-02-27 16:04:46	jesse	I'll still need to confirm with Kowolenko before we actually try to do this [:+1:1] 
2018-02-27 16:25:19	Arun	Yeah thats right. And Okay, so meanwhile what do you want me to work on? 
2018-02-27 16:28:18	jesse	I think you should look into trying to find a way to compare the medical school names and see if the medical school names in the specialists match with the pubmed affiliations. 
2018-02-27 16:40:26	Arun	Okay, I will look at that today and let you know when I am done with it 
2018-02-27 16:41:25	jesse	xD I wouldn't expect you to be done with it. but let me know what your thinking about that problem. Also figured we should clarify that for the specialists, we are referring to the data from http://medicare.gov (medicare.gov) rather than the other specialist data we gathered. 
2018-02-27 16:43:07	Arun	Ahh, I see. Alright. I will look into that website and see what data we've got. And yeah, I will let you know my thoughts before I actually start coding it 
2018-02-27 16:46:31	jesse	https://data.medicare.gov/Physician-Compare/Physician-Compare-National-Downloadable-File/mj5m-pzi6
2018-02-27 16:46:31		Physician Compare National Downloadable File | Data.Medicare.gov
2018-02-27 16:46:31		Physician Compare National Downloadable File - The Physician Compare National Downloadable File is organized at the individual eligible professional level; each line is unique at the professional/enrollment record/Group Practice/address level. Professionals with multiple Medicare enrollment records and/or single enrollments linking to multiple practice location addresses are listed on multiple lines. [:heavy_check_mark:1 :+1:1 :slightly_smiling_face:1] 
2018-02-27 20:13:11	jesse	Hey Arun, have you been working on that problem? ^^ 
2018-02-27 20:13:48	Arun	Not yet Jesse, I was planning to look at it tonight post dinner 
2018-02-27 20:14:50	jesse	ahh I gotcha. I was just wonderin. I'm trying to decide what I wanna do, whether it's eat dinner, work on this, or go back to my apartment and play a video game :stuck_out_tongue: 
2018-02-27 20:38:51	Arun	Haha, sometime  of video game wouldn't hurt anything I believe! :smile: 
2018-02-27 21:09:54	jesse	sadly I chose to work on another project :disappointed: 
2018-02-28 13:25:40	Arun	Hey Jesse, afternoon! So, I checked out the website and also the pubmed data. What you said makes sense. 
2018-02-28 13:25:40		And once we make all the necessary calculations, we could probably try to sort the list with current NC specialist coming on the top and then in the order of nearest states wrt NC 
2018-02-28 13:26:39	Arun	But we are expected to finish all this by next thursday? 
2018-02-28 13:29:05	jesse	did you read the messages on the rarediseases channel? 
2018-02-28 13:29:16	Arun	Yes I did 
2018-02-28 13:29:29	Arun	I just checked out the messages there 
2018-02-28 13:32:14	jesse	i gotcha. yeah we are supposed to have something to show off by next thursday. I'm thinking the only truly difficult task we will have to deal with is comparing the names of the medical schools.  If we have to download all of the pubmed data, we will have a lot more troubles, which is why I'm going to try to run the script without the NC filter and see if it takes significantly more time or not. 
2018-02-28 13:34:42	Arun	Okay that would be a start. Do you want us to meet anytime this week or weekend? I fear I won't be available next week starting Monday :disappointed: 
2018-02-28 13:35:34	jesse	I'm going to charlotte starting thursday night up until next sunday... I won't be able to meet. I can do google hangouts though... but thats not as helpful 
2018-02-28 13:37:12	Arun	Ah, I see. Alright then, we will figure it out. But let's split up the work and finish it off as much as possible. 
2018-02-28 13:38:05	Arun	One question, why do you want to strip out the University names? Like, you were saying NC State University will result in 'state' which is not of any use. But, why do we have to it? 
2018-02-28 13:44:01	jesse	agreed. I'll have more information tonight... so it'll be clearer what all we need to do by the meeting time tomorrow. No matter what though, we need to find a way to compare the University names.
2018-02-28 13:44:01		As for that, the names of the affiliations in the pubmed data are not the same as the medical schools in the specialists data. We need to find a way to connect people on first/lastname (easy) and then by the university... my thought was that we could strip away some of the meaningless words so that we could match the names of the schools... but that won't work for the above reason you mentioned. Ingrams aren't too great either since swapping North Carolina State University also could match University of North Carolina State.
2018-02-28 13:44:01		Don't get too fixated on things that I say. I'm just trying to get you to understand the problem.  If you can find a way to keep all of the words in and determine that two schools are the same, all power to ya. 
2018-02-28 13:47:57	Arun	Haha, agreed. I understand you are trying to explain me the problem. :slightly_smiling_face: 
2018-02-28 13:50:23	Arun	And alright, meanwhile, let me know if you need anything! 
2018-02-28 13:50:40	jesse	Sure thing. 
2018-03-01 14:03:57	jesse	I posted the notes/todo thing I made for the week. take a look at that and then you can ask me if you have any questions. 
2018-03-01 20:16:16	Arun	Hey, I just had a look at it now. 
2018-03-01 20:19:33	Arun	I see there are immediate stuffs to get done with regard to matching physicians with pubmed data. Will you be working on any task particularly? 
2018-03-01 21:17:22	jesse	i havent decided the order Ill start tackling these things yet. sorry i didnt respond. i was driving 
2018-03-01 21:18:27	Arun	No worries! :slightly_smiling_face: And, let me know how we can go about it, if you got any leads 
2018-03-04 01:18:58	Arun	Hey, so for comparing the affiliation from pubmed and physician's medical school name, we can probably just check if medical school name is present in pubmed affiliation. 
2018-03-04 01:18:58		For example, as far as I noticed, the Physician's medical school name is pretty organised, but pubmed affiliations seem to have lot of redundant names.
2018-03-04 01:18:58		In this method, we can convert the physician's medical school name to an array and check if all the elements of the array is in pubmed affiliation. If so, we can assure that they both are the same person. 
2018-03-04 01:18:58		What do you think about this? 
2018-03-04 01:22:05	Arun	And for us to match physicians data from pubmed and physician data, the fastest method would be to put it in a DB and then querying it. 
2018-03-04 09:12:58	jesse	Hey Arun, I agree that the pubmed data is scattered and that the physician data is more organized and condensed. however, I dont think it will be enough to just check if the physician med school is in the affiliation.
2018-03-04 09:12:58		Have you taken a look at certain schools that would and would not match under this scenario? If you have, and you are comfortable with the results that gives, then sure... but im thinking we may need to worry about ngrams and abbreviations.
2018-03-04 09:12:58		Ive been trying to compile a list of all schools contained in the pubmed data and sort them, but it's been running for twelve hours and I dont think itll finish. maybe i should try a much smaller dataset.. 
2018-03-04 09:18:25	jesse	I've got a list  of the affiliations that came from diseases beginning with X-Z 
2018-03-04 09:19:24	jesse	maybe we can use that and the list of med schools from the physician data to help us determine a good matching system. 
2018-03-04 09:30:50	jesse	I also had Sagar working a lil bit on this. I gave him a list of 400 med school names that came from the physician data and had him make abbreviations for each one. (i hope he wrote a program to do this lol) 
2018-03-04 12:00:15	Arun	Right, and for matching two med school names, I can probably write a script that would take care of abbreviations too. It will be very similar to the script I wrote for comparing names in any order 
2018-03-04 12:06:22	jesse	ok. if you can, try to make it so that we arent loading the entire CSVs into the script.
2018-03-04 12:06:22		many of these files are gigabytes of text, so we will run out of memory if we do that. 
2018-03-04 12:15:54	Arun	Right, well I?m sure of how to do that part. Like, I can read from the CSV and for each line in the CSV, I will have to read from the physician?s CSV. But, in this way, for each ?row? in the pubmed, I will be reading all the rows from the physician CSV, every time. 
2018-03-04 12:15:54		Is there any other way that you know of? 
2018-03-04 12:16:11	Arun	I mean, I?m *not sure of how to do that part 
2018-03-04 12:30:35	jesse	I'm not sure either. 
2018-03-04 12:39:42	jesse	I'm gonna try to filter out the duplicates out of the pubmed data once again and see what the file size is. 
2018-03-04 12:56:03	jesse	Are you working on raredx stuff right now? 
2018-03-04 12:58:02	Arun	I'm guessing the best way to go forward would be to put it on a DB and query data. 
2018-03-04 12:58:52	Arun	Anyway, I am not working on it right now. 
2018-03-04 13:07:09	jesse	put what specifically on the db? 
2018-03-04 13:07:34	Arun	Both, the pubmed data and the physician data. Instead of having it on a CSV 
2018-03-04 13:09:25	Arun	Do you believe our searching would be faster that way? 
2018-03-04 13:15:59	jesse	I'm not sure it would matter. once pandas loads it into memory, it doesn't matter. if you were thinking of doing some sort of join statement or some python thing that worked directly with psql, then it would be faster. 
2018-03-04 15:08:59	Arun	Yeah, thats true too, alright then 
2018-03-04 20:08:59	jesse	arun, do you have a script for the medschool comparison? 
2018-03-04 21:03:00	Arun	Hey, I will send you in sometime, like half hour? I am on my way home now from outside 
2018-03-04 21:03:51	jesse	sounds good 
2018-03-04 22:23:18	Arun	Hi Jesse :slightly_smiling_face: 
2018-03-04 22:24:51	Arun	Can I send the script here? 
2018-03-04 22:27:56	Arun	@Arun uploaded a file: https://ncstateuniversityitng.slack.com/files/U95TJ10M9/F9JFZ3Z45/comparemednames.py (compareMedNames.py) and commented: Script that compares Medical School Names from pubmed data and physcian data 
2018-03-04 22:30:22	Arun	I ran this script by taking names manually form the pubmed csv and the physician data. And it worked fine for the names I used. 
2018-03-04 22:31:42	Arun	I wouldn't say this script works very fine.  There will definitely be some good amount of false positive. But since we are already comparing the names, and this is more like a second factor to affirm our decision if two persons are the same, I'm hoping this would work fine. 
2018-03-04 22:36:20	Arun	@Arun uploaded a file: https://ncstateuniversityitng.slack.com/files/U95TJ10M9/F9JBS09T6/pip_package_for_fuzzywuzzy.txt (pip package for fuzzywuzzy) and commented: Forgot to mention, you need to install the fuzzywuzzy package for this. 
2018-03-04 23:04:26	jesse	I'll take a look tomorrow. i appreciate it dude. i tried to run a script tonight but my computer froze again.... these files are just too big :( 
2018-03-05 00:21:37	Arun	Ah, I see. Yeah please run it tomorrow and let me know how it runs against our data. :slightly_smiling_face: Thanks Jesse 
2018-03-05 00:21:58	Arun	And also, do you want my script for name comparison as well? 
2018-03-05 07:13:07	jesse	yes plz. anything would help. 
2018-03-05 10:25:10	Arun	Okay, I will slightly modify whatever I?ve coded and send you in sometime. 
2018-03-05 10:25:10		I?m not working on it right now, but I?ll send you! Is that okay? 
2018-03-05 10:25:36	jesse	yeah. 
2018-03-05 10:25:40	jesse	Thanks 
2018-03-05 16:44:45	Arun	@Arun uploaded a file: https://ncstateuniversityitng.slack.com/files/U95TJ10M9/F9JBZ2HND/comparenames.py (compareNames.py) 
2018-03-06 14:54:17	Arun	Hey Jesse, I am so sorry, I have an important interview this Thursday and thus I am unable to work on it, as I have to prepare myself for the interview. I hope you understand and its alright. I will be back only by Thursday night. 
2018-03-06 14:56:03	jesse	yeah I got you. just means more money for me :stuck_out_tongue: 
2018-03-06 14:56:44	jesse	I might get Michael or meaghan to help code some of this up too. xD 
2018-03-08 18:51:24	Arun	Hi Jesse. 
2018-03-08 18:51:30	Arun	How you doing? 
2018-03-08 18:51:57	Arun	Is there anything that you want me to work on? I can work on it tomorrow 
2018-03-08 19:34:53	jesse	hey dude. ya know that list, YetAnotherMedicalSchoolList? 
2018-03-08 19:41:28	jesse	I would like the medical schools, all 404 of them  to have which state that they came from. This will be a big help with the comparisons.
2018-03-08 19:41:28		right now, I only have a program that gets the NC comparisons. this was done for the sake of efficiency... the program as it is takes 30 mins to run. with all 50 states, its gonna take 24 hours if we generate sql statements for all of them.... this is still far better than the estimated 600 days that a nested for loop would cause. 
2018-03-08 19:42:18	jesse	and I'm doing alright. i needed to run the pubmed data once more which kinda sucks. 
2018-03-09 02:45:49	Arun	YetAnotherMedicalSchoolList? I am not aware of that list 
2018-03-09 03:11:18	Arun	Oh, we have created all the databases now? 
2018-03-09 08:01:13	jesse	oh sorry i mustve spoken to sagar about that one 
2018-03-09 08:02:08	jesse	we dont have all the databases now since i got one generating right now. its the pubmed junk again. 
2018-03-09 08:03:20	jesse	YetAnotherMedicalSchoolList is something where I took all of the specialists medical schools and filtered out all the duplicates. its in the google drive 
2018-03-09 08:04:01	jesse	there were a few different lists of medical schools at this point, so thats what I decided to call it. 
2018-03-09 08:12:22	jesse	I've also got a program for checking for matches in the med schools. we need that program to match as many as possible without doing something complex like n grams... i think. if we do the ngrams, our program will take forever to run... although it may be feasible for just NC. 
2018-03-09 08:13:02	jesse	if you'd like to try to upgrade that program, feel free. 
2018-03-09 08:18:48	jesse	if you want to see those 2 programs, theyre in power6a under/home/jlsimps4/ForTheGreatAndPowerfulMichael/
2018-03-09 08:18:48		since michael was wanting to look into them.
2018-03-09 08:18:48		they require a database for the specialists and the pubmed stuff, so you can find those csvs in the ForMeaghan folder... to convert between the two, you can just use a psql \copy statement 
2018-03-09 19:23:01	Arun	Hey Jesse, I?m just checking out your messages. So comparing med schools, you have written a separate script? 
2018-03-09 19:24:02	Arun	And, you took the YetAnotherMedicalSchoolList from the already available specialist data ( that website you sent me previously) , I believe? 
2018-03-09 19:34:00	jesse	yep. the scripts are in the pubmed-crawler folder in the rarediseases repo 
2018-03-09 19:35:33	Arun	Okay I will look into it!  
2018-03-09 19:36:58	Arun	So, you want me to do which state does these universities/medical school come from eh?  
2018-03-09 19:38:46	jesse	yeah. preferably the two letter code. NC for north carolina. I asked sagar to look at the same thing so you may want to message him. And maybe put messages in the patientportalpeeps channel since I've had to repeat myself for both you and Sagar. 
2018-03-10 15:18:08	Arun	Alright I will talk to Sagar and check where he is 
2018-03-10 21:39:13	Arun	Hey. I checked with Sagar, he said he is good with doing that part. So, is there something else I could work on?  
2018-03-10 21:40:53	jesse	have you seen the script for the medschool comparisons ? 
2018-03-10 21:51:09	jesse	There are 2, getPhysicianPubmedConnection.py and compareMedSchools.py
2018-03-10 21:51:09		We are no longer deleting the duplicates from the pubmed dataset because we are keeping the disease ids with the articles... What this means is that it will take longer for the program  to run. We need to make it more efficient if possible.
2018-03-10 21:51:09		As for the second file, we need to do whatever we can to get more medical schools to match... this could be achieved by doing Ngrams or by removing more nonsense words. 
2018-03-10 21:51:09		and last of all, you can check if Janne needs help with the drug companies. I havent heard back from her.
2018-03-10 21:51:09		That is all I would know to do. There are also some issues you could look into on github. 
2018-03-10 21:55:19	jesse	Also stuff about Mesh terms when gathering the pubmed data... but I think we should hold off on that until we figure out  how to get these comparisons efficiently. [:+1:1] 
2018-03-11 14:39:29	Arun	I did check those scripts recently, but I will do go through it again today or tomorrow, to start looking into it. I will look at the compareMedSchools.py and see what we can we do it make it match better. 
2018-03-11 14:40:21	Arun	And yes, I will check with Janne too, and see if she is doing okay. 
2018-04-12 13:45:44	jesse	Hey Arun, in the meeting today, it seemed like you finished whatever you were doing, and the team wanted you to help me out with researching the Alternative Medicines. We don't really have any leads on that, just need to find out what sources are good for that and what we can scrape. 
2018-04-12 13:46:20	Arun	Hi Jesse, I was just about to ping you regarding the same  
2018-04-12 13:46:59	Arun	So, I need to look out for data on alternative medicines? 
2018-04-12 13:49:41	jesse	yep. do google searches, or whatever you can to build up a list of websites that we can scrape data from. 
2018-04-12 13:49:58	Arun	Yes, I can do that  
2018-04-12 13:51:01	jesse	I'll be doing the same thing, so let me know if you find anything, and I will let you know if I find anything. If we find something good enough to scrape, then we can focus on that, but for now, lets just get links. 
2018-04-12 15:08:33	Arun	Okaaay sure, sounds good  
2018-04-16 16:34:23		getting channel history...
2018-02-16 19:17:25	jesse	also, the csv name at the bottom will be changed. Its the contractors one now because I was copying and pasting stuff 
2018-02-16 19:18:07	jesse	My current issue is that I would like to get a date out of the article. 
2018-02-16 19:22:18	Arun	Great, that is perfect!  
2018-02-16 19:22:36	Arun	Is there any significance for the date field? 
2018-02-16 19:23:13	Arun	Other than just to sort the articles chronologically? 
2018-02-16 19:27:21	jesse	not really. My thinking was just that a date might be nice to have. If 2 articles are about the same rare_dx, then maybe the newer one might be more credible. but this would just be a side objective. A better solution is to find some sort of id field, since we already have a table in a database for pubmed stuff. (the problem with that table is that it only has the first initial of the last name or first name.) 
2018-02-16 19:30:15	Arun	Oh, I see. Where exactly is that database? In that http://power6.ncsu.edu (power6.ncsu.edu) machine? I mean, is there any other databases that we have? 
2018-02-16 19:32:21	jesse	on power6a in ncbi database 
2018-02-16 19:32:35	Arun	Okay okay cool. 
2018-02-16 19:33:19	Arun	And yeah, I am going through the script that you uploaded now. And I will also take a look at what Janne and Sagar has done 
2018-02-16 19:34:01	jesse	this was built off of what sagar did. I'm not sure Janne had anything worth pushing 
2018-02-16 19:37:20	jesse	the table for the pubmed rare diseases should not be counted on. it only has 1000 rows. I think we will have to create our own. 
2018-02-16 19:37:51	jesse	and they didn't even store date :disappointed: 
2018-02-16 19:41:47	Arun	Oh I see. Anyway, we do have the APIs to get the data right? For pubmed 
2018-02-16 19:42:12	jesse	thats what the Bio package at the top is. 
2018-02-16 19:42:28	Arun	Yeah right. Okay cool!  
2018-02-16 19:42:30	jesse	we basically have the data, but its kinda a blobby dictionary thats hard to get through 
2018-02-16 19:42:56	Arun	Ah, like that! Alright, got it  
2018-02-16 19:44:55	jesse	ok i got the date. I'm gonna push again if ya don't mind. 
2018-02-16 19:46:21	Arun	But anyway, if required, can we meet once on Sunday? Only if you are free  
2018-02-16 19:46:30	Arun	Awesome :grin: 
2018-02-16 19:46:38	jesse	yup. 
2018-02-16 19:47:37	jesse	ok i pushed the stuff. 
2018-02-16 19:47:41	Arun	So, I?ll go through everything and see if I?m able to understand everything that we?ve got! And Sunday I?ll ask you the questions if I have any, and we can probably sit together and get done with this part!  
2018-02-16 19:48:50	jesse	Sounds good. 
2018-02-17 21:28:14	Arun	Hey Jesse, Will you be free post lunch tomorrow? 
2018-02-18 07:54:57	jesse	yeah 
2018-02-18 11:11:16	Arun	Great, shall we meet at 4pm today then? For about 1-2 hours maximum  
2018-02-18 11:20:23	jesse	Sounds good. I've been doing quite a bit of work to this script. for the most part, I just need to let you know what my current code gathers, the errors I'm running into, what needs to be done with the outputted CSV files, and stuff like that. My thinking is after we meet at 4, I can hand the rest of the work concerning pubmed stuff to you, and I can then switch to working on the drug company data and some of the other minor tasks. 
2018-02-18 14:38:33	Arun	Sure, I?ll be in Hunt grad commons. I?ve booked room number 4314  
2018-02-18 14:39:18	jesse	can undergrads go there? 
2018-02-18 14:40:01	Arun	Ah, I totally forgot about that! But I guess you can come inside if I'm with you 
2018-02-18 14:41:52	jesse	ok. are you there now or should i wait till 4? 
2018-02-18 14:42:16	Arun	I am here in library. We can meet now, sure! But the room is available only from 4 
2018-02-18 14:42:40	Arun	So, if you can find another room, I sure can come 
2018-02-18 14:46:44	jesse	I just checked. there is no room available that I can reserve.  
2018-02-18 14:47:03	Arun	Yeah, that's what I thought too! 
2018-02-18 14:47:29	Arun	Anyway, we can still meet now if you wish 
2018-02-18 14:52:32	jesse	sure. I'm just laying in my bed anyway. give me a few minutes to finish the current csv my computer is workin on and so I can make tea /get ready to leave 
2018-02-18 14:52:56	Arun	Yeah sure, take your time! :slightly_smiling_face: 
2018-02-18 15:03:18	jesse	im at the library now 
2018-02-18 15:03:46	Arun	Oh good. Can you come to 4th floor? I'll come near the lift 
2018-02-18 18:36:25	jesse	Did you specify in LibreOffice that the CSV's were comma separated when you opened it? 
2018-02-18 18:36:50	jesse	usually it says "separate by [] comma  [] semicolon [] space... etc 
2018-02-18 18:37:18	jesse	In the big CSV, I'm getting no entries that are overflowing. 
2018-02-18 18:39:05	jesse	Same with the little csv 
2018-02-18 18:40:22	Arun	Ah really? Damn, I didn?t notice that! But yeah, the next time I open it I?ll check that too 
2018-02-18 18:44:23	jesse	I'm gonna run the entire thing once more to try to locate the XML parsing error. hopefully I'll be able to narrow it down to a place and put a try/except thing around it to just skip the document if it fails to parse. 
2018-02-18 18:44:56	jesse	If you already have that stacktrace in your terminal, could you check the line number? 
2018-02-18 18:50:04	jesse	i think i'll just put an except around the search/query part. my guess is thats where the issue is. 
2018-02-18 18:58:01	Arun	Gimme sometime, I?ll check and let you know the line number  
2018-02-18 19:27:34	Arun	My new CSV is being generated now, and I cannot check back the stacktrace 
2018-02-18 19:27:51	jesse	thats ok. I've got a CSV generating myself. 
2018-02-18 19:28:38	jesse	quick trick: if you run "tmux" you can detach the terminal so that you can close out of the terminal and do other things while the program is being run in the background. [:+1:1 :heavy_check_mark:1] 
2018-02-18 21:16:47	jesse	I got the full csv and it's beautiful 
2018-02-18 21:17:20	jesse	i mean, its what you'd expect... a csv, but I've been working quite hard just to get it lol 
2018-02-18 21:23:57	jesse	also, I don't think I pulled your changes, since you removed the fun stuff like abstract and title 
2018-02-19 18:23:21	jesse	Hey Arun, you have yurika working on your computer right? 
2018-02-19 18:23:45	jesse	Janne was wanting to use it for getting info on drug companies. 
2018-02-19 20:40:41	Arun	Hey yeah, I have it in Running! Sorry, for the late reply  
2018-02-19 20:41:27	Arun	Janne wants to use it? Sure, we can try using it. But the websites that we use should allow crawling  
2018-02-19 20:42:18	jesse	cool. I'm not sure what Janne needs. I was working with her tonight and the drug company information is chaos. I'll try to ask Janne and get her to message 
2018-02-19 20:42:19	jesse	you 
2018-02-19 20:42:35	Arun	Or I can ping Janne right away and save some time :)  
2018-02-19 20:43:08	jesse	cool! I hope it works out. 
2018-02-19 20:43:22	Arun	Alright, pinged her now!  
2018-02-19 20:44:11	jesse	Thanks dude. i tried it on my computer but i think postgresql is forever broke on my computer from trying to mess with agensgraph 
2018-02-19 20:44:58	Arun	Ah, I see! Alright, not an issue! Let?s see if we are able to get the data using Yurika  
2018-02-26 12:51:32	Arun	Hey Jesse, I just realized that I have some work for today evening. Is it alright if we push today's meeting to tomorrow? 
2018-02-26 12:58:37	jesse	i guess that depends on everyone else. i could probably meet both today and tomorrow and not run out of things to do. 
2018-02-26 12:59:04	Arun	Okay, If others are making it, I'll try to make it too! 
2018-02-26 12:59:56	jesse	ok. if not, I can just let you know what happens, whether its by text or meeting up tomorrow. 
2018-02-26 13:00:39	Arun	Alright, that's great! I'll keep you posted :slightly_smiling_face: 
2018-02-27 09:06:59	jesse	Hey Arun, I met up with Sagar last night, and Janne separately. we've got a few issues with the pubmed stuff.
2018-02-27 09:06:59		I'll give ya a quick run down:
2018-02-27 09:06:59		our pubmed data filtered everyone who were affiliated with medical schools in NC
2018-02-27 09:06:59		our specialist data filtered everyone whos hospital was in NC.
2018-02-27 09:06:59		issue 1.   many people work in NC hospitals and have their medical degrees from places outside of NC.
2018-02-27 09:06:59		but lets ignore that for now.
2018-02-27 09:06:59		issue 2. the medical schools in the pubmed data is not uniform with the specialists data for schools they came from. matching UNC Chapel Hill would be fairly easy since Chapel Hill is unique... but take North Carolina State University... filter out the unnecessary words like "north carolina" and "university" and your left with ..."state"... which doesnt help. also consider that many pubmed researchers dont seem to be affiliated with a university or school of medicine... but rather just a lab...
2018-02-27 09:06:59		Back to Issue 1. If we want to fix this, we would be looking to scrape all of the pubmed data  rather than just NC (an estimated 300hr process with extra hours for filtering duplicates.)   alternatively, we could just  not filter the specialists at all but this comes with its own risks. (still preferable but it leads us back to issue 2.)
2018-02-27 09:06:59		As for Janne, she's been working hard scraping the drug company data. sadly a good amount of her work  must be done manually. 
2018-02-27 15:29:47	Arun	Hey Jesse, just seeing your message now. Thanks for the update! 
2018-02-27 15:31:00	Arun	Regarding issue 1, we can try to write a write to check if we are getting data properly, say upto 1000 or 10000 rows. Once we are sure about the script, we can request a machine to Meaghan and we can run our script in that machine, instead of running in our personal machine 
2018-02-27 15:42:01	jesse	that sounds reasonable, but it may be better if we could just download the entire pubmed data set rather than webscraping: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/databases/download/pubmed_medline.html
2018-02-27 15:42:01		I'm not sure if this would be too much memory or not, but they also have daily update files so we wouldn't have to re-download it every time... we would just need a way to convert the xml to postgresql... [:+1:1] 
2018-02-27 15:48:34	Arun	Oh yeah, I didnt know we could download the data directly. 
2018-02-27 15:49:28	Arun	Btw, for this week I am yet to clock in and start working on specialist-disease relation 
2018-02-27 15:49:48	jesse	ya wanna task? 
2018-02-27 15:50:02	Arun	I've been busy with my stuff. I guess I will be able to work a maximum of only 8-10 hours this week and next week 
2018-02-27 15:50:53	Arun	I will try writing the script to manipulate the name according to the pubmed data and see if I can find matches 
2018-02-27 15:51:03	Arun	Once I am done with that work, I can work on other task 
2018-02-27 15:51:28	jesse	hold on with that. 
2018-02-27 15:51:46	Arun	Are you sure about it? 
2018-02-27 15:52:01	Arun	I can hold on it and work on something more important if there is any 
2018-02-27 15:54:13	jesse	part of this past meeting was that since we cannot just match first and last name, since many first names are not full names... So we wanted to link them to their universities. So if a person with the last name of Hayes went to Chapel Hill in pubmed, we could say that they are the same person who is listed in specialists as Hayes who went to Chapel Hill. Do ya follow? 
2018-02-27 15:54:49	Arun	Okay, I get it. Yeah, it makes sense 
2018-02-27 15:56:05	jesse	Also, If we download the entire pubmed thing... and somehow make it into a pubmed database, we will need to modify whatever script you were planning on writing. 
2018-02-27 15:56:28	Arun	But, Is it the only way to confirm if two persons are the same? Is there other possibilities to confirm that. I was thinking something like, if the name is Mathew Hayes and we have M Hayes, chances that they both are same is quite high, whats your thought on that? 
2018-02-27 15:58:23	jesse	we could check firstname too... but ideally we would want M Hayes from Chapel Hill === Mathew Hayes from Chapel Hill... If we are opening up all of pubmed to all of the specialists in the united states... then first and last name is no longer accurate enough.. since there are a ton of mathew hayes from the united states whereas maybe not so much with just NC. 
2018-02-27 15:58:50	Arun	Yeah agreed! 
2018-02-27 16:00:22	Arun	But since there are way too many pubmed data and too many specialists too, the computation could take more time when we start comparing different fields simulatenously, I thought. 
2018-02-27 16:00:22		But nevertheless, what you said would definitely work :slightly_smiling_face: 
2018-02-27 16:04:28	jesse	it would take more time, but it would maybe be a couple hour process just from a rough estimate i think 
2018-02-27 16:04:46	jesse	I'll still need to confirm with Kowolenko before we actually try to do this [:+1:1] 
2018-02-27 16:25:19	Arun	Yeah thats right. And Okay, so meanwhile what do you want me to work on? 
2018-02-27 16:28:18	jesse	I think you should look into trying to find a way to compare the medical school names and see if the medical school names in the specialists match with the pubmed affiliations. 
2018-02-27 16:40:26	Arun	Okay, I will look at that today and let you know when I am done with it 
2018-02-27 16:41:25	jesse	xD I wouldn't expect you to be done with it. but let me know what your thinking about that problem. Also figured we should clarify that for the specialists, we are referring to the data from http://medicare.gov (medicare.gov) rather than the other specialist data we gathered. 
2018-02-27 16:43:07	Arun	Ahh, I see. Alright. I will look into that website and see what data we've got. And yeah, I will let you know my thoughts before I actually start coding it 
2018-02-27 16:46:31	jesse	https://data.medicare.gov/Physician-Compare/Physician-Compare-National-Downloadable-File/mj5m-pzi6

[:heavy_check_mark:1 :+1:1 :slightly_smiling_face:1] 
2018-02-27 20:13:11	jesse	Hey Arun, have you been working on that problem? ^^ 
2018-02-27 20:13:48	Arun	Not yet Jesse, I was planning to look at it tonight post dinner 
2018-02-27 20:14:50	jesse	ahh I gotcha. I was just wonderin. I'm trying to decide what I wanna do, whether it's eat dinner, work on this, or go back to my apartment and play a video game :stuck_out_tongue: 
2018-02-27 20:38:51	Arun	Haha, sometime  of video game wouldn't hurt anything I believe! :smile: 
2018-02-27 21:09:54	jesse	sadly I chose to work on another project :disappointed: 
2018-02-28 13:25:40	Arun	Hey Jesse, afternoon! So, I checked out the website and also the pubmed data. What you said makes sense. 
2018-02-28 13:25:40		And once we make all the necessary calculations, we could probably try to sort the list with current NC specialist coming on the top and then in the order of nearest states wrt NC 
2018-02-28 13:26:39	Arun	But we are expected to finish all this by next thursday? 
2018-02-28 13:29:05	jesse	did you read the messages on the rarediseases channel? 
2018-02-28 13:29:16	Arun	Yes I did 
2018-02-28 13:29:29	Arun	I just checked out the messages there 
2018-02-28 13:32:14	jesse	i gotcha. yeah we are supposed to have something to show off by next thursday. I'm thinking the only truly difficult task we will have to deal with is comparing the names of the medical schools.  If we have to download all of the pubmed data, we will have a lot more troubles, which is why I'm going to try to run the script without the NC filter and see if it takes significantly more time or not. 
2018-02-28 13:34:42	Arun	Okay that would be a start. Do you want us to meet anytime this week or weekend? I fear I won't be available next week starting Monday :disappointed: 
2018-02-28 13:35:34	jesse	I'm going to charlotte starting thursday night up until next sunday... I won't be able to meet. I can do google hangouts though... but thats not as helpful 
2018-02-28 13:37:12	Arun	Ah, I see. Alright then, we will figure it out. But let's split up the work and finish it off as much as possible. 
2018-02-28 13:38:05	Arun	One question, why do you want to strip out the University names? Like, you were saying NC State University will result in 'state' which is not of any use. But, why do we have to it? 
2018-02-28 13:44:01	jesse	agreed. I'll have more information tonight... so it'll be clearer what all we need to do by the meeting time tomorrow. No matter what though, we need to find a way to compare the University names.
2018-02-28 13:44:01		As for that, the names of the affiliations in the pubmed data are not the same as the medical schools in the specialists data. We need to find a way to connect people on first/lastname (easy) and then by the university... my thought was that we could strip away some of the meaningless words so that we could match the names of the schools... but that won't work for the above reason you mentioned. Ingrams aren't too great either since swapping North Carolina State University also could match University of North Carolina State.
2018-02-28 13:44:01		Don't get too fixated on things that I say. I'm just trying to get you to understand the problem.  If you can find a way to keep all of the words in and determine that two schools are the same, all power to ya. 
2018-02-28 13:47:57	Arun	Haha, agreed. I understand you are trying to explain me the problem. :slightly_smiling_face: 
2018-02-28 13:50:23	Arun	And alright, meanwhile, let me know if you need anything! 
2018-02-28 13:50:40	jesse	Sure thing. 
2018-03-01 14:03:57	jesse	I posted the notes/todo thing I made for the week. take a look at that and then you can ask me if you have any questions. 
2018-03-01 20:16:16	Arun	Hey, I just had a look at it now. 
2018-03-01 20:19:33	Arun	I see there are immediate stuffs to get done with regard to matching physicians with pubmed data. Will you be working on any task particularly? 
2018-03-01 21:17:22	jesse	i havent decided the order Ill start tackling these things yet. sorry i didnt respond. i was driving 
2018-03-01 21:18:27	Arun	No worries! :slightly_smiling_face: And, let me know how we can go about it, if you got any leads 
2018-03-04 01:18:58	Arun	Hey, so for comparing the affiliation from pubmed and physician's medical school name, we can probably just check if medical school name is present in pubmed affiliation. 
2018-03-04 01:18:58		For example, as far as I noticed, the Physician's medical school name is pretty organised, but pubmed affiliations seem to have lot of redundant names.
2018-03-04 01:18:58		In this method, we can convert the physician's medical school name to an array and check if all the elements of the array is in pubmed affiliation. If so, we can assure that they both are the same person. 
2018-03-04 01:18:58		What do you think about this? 
2018-03-04 01:22:05	Arun	And for us to match physicians data from pubmed and physician data, the fastest method would be to put it in a DB and then querying it. 
2018-03-04 09:12:58	jesse	Hey Arun, I agree that the pubmed data is scattered and that the physician data is more organized and condensed. however, I dont think it will be enough to just check if the physician med school is in the affiliation.
2018-03-04 09:12:58		Have you taken a look at certain schools that would and would not match under this scenario? If you have, and you are comfortable with the results that gives, then sure... but im thinking we may need to worry about ngrams and abbreviations.
2018-03-04 09:12:58		Ive been trying to compile a list of all schools contained in the pubmed data and sort them, but it's been running for twelve hours and I dont think itll finish. maybe i should try a much smaller dataset.. 
2018-03-04 09:18:25	jesse	I've got a list  of the affiliations that came from diseases beginning with X-Z 
2018-03-04 09:19:24	jesse	maybe we can use that and the list of med schools from the physician data to help us determine a good matching system. 
2018-03-04 09:30:50	jesse	I also had Sagar working a lil bit on this. I gave him a list of 400 med school names that came from the physician data and had him make abbreviations for each one. (i hope he wrote a program to do this lol) 
2018-03-04 12:00:15	Arun	Right, and for matching two med school names, I can probably write a script that would take care of abbreviations too. It will be very similar to the script I wrote for comparing names in any order 
2018-03-04 12:06:22	jesse	ok. if you can, try to make it so that we arent loading the entire CSVs into the script.
2018-03-04 12:06:22		many of these files are gigabytes of text, so we will run out of memory if we do that. 
2018-03-04 12:15:54	Arun	Right, well I?m sure of how to do that part. Like, I can read from the CSV and for each line in the CSV, I will have to read from the physician?s CSV. But, in this way, for each ?row? in the pubmed, I will be reading all the rows from the physician CSV, every time. 
2018-03-04 12:15:54		Is there any other way that you know of? 
2018-03-04 12:16:11	Arun	I mean, I?m *not sure of how to do that part 
2018-03-04 12:30:35	jesse	I'm not sure either. 
2018-03-04 12:39:42	jesse	I'm gonna try to filter out the duplicates out of the pubmed data once again and see what the file size is. 
2018-03-04 12:56:03	jesse	Are you working on raredx stuff right now? 
2018-03-04 12:58:02	Arun	I'm guessing the best way to go forward would be to put it on a DB and query data. 
2018-03-04 12:58:52	Arun	Anyway, I am not working on it right now. 
2018-03-04 13:07:09	jesse	put what specifically on the db? 
2018-03-04 13:07:34	Arun	Both, the pubmed data and the physician data. Instead of having it on a CSV 
2018-03-04 13:09:25	Arun	Do you believe our searching would be faster that way? 
2018-03-04 13:15:59	jesse	I'm not sure it would matter. once pandas loads it into memory, it doesn't matter. if you were thinking of doing some sort of join statement or some python thing that worked directly with psql, then it would be faster. 
2018-03-04 15:08:59	Arun	Yeah, thats true too, alright then 
2018-03-04 20:08:59	jesse	arun, do you have a script for the medschool comparison? 
2018-03-04 21:03:00	Arun	Hey, I will send you in sometime, like half hour? I am on my way home now from outside 
2018-03-04 21:03:51	jesse	sounds good 
2018-03-04 22:23:18	Arun	Hi Jesse :slightly_smiling_face: 
2018-03-04 22:24:51	Arun	Can I send the script here? 
2018-03-04 22:27:56	Arun	@Arun uploaded a file: https://ncstateuniversityitng.slack.com/files/U95TJ10M9/F9JFZ3Z45/comparemednames.py (compareMedNames.py) and commented: Script that compares Medical School Names from pubmed data and physcian data 
2018-03-04 22:30:22	Arun	I ran this script by taking names manually form the pubmed csv and the physician data. And it worked fine for the names I used. 
2018-03-04 22:31:42	Arun	I wouldn't say this script works very fine.  There will definitely be some good amount of false positive. But since we are already comparing the names, and this is more like a second factor to affirm our decision if two persons are the same, I'm hoping this would work fine. 
2018-03-04 22:36:20	Arun	@Arun uploaded a file: https://ncstateuniversityitng.slack.com/files/U95TJ10M9/F9JBS09T6/pip_package_for_fuzzywuzzy.txt (pip package for fuzzywuzzy) and commented: Forgot to mention, you need to install the fuzzywuzzy package for this. 
2018-03-04 23:04:26	jesse	I'll take a look tomorrow. i appreciate it dude. i tried to run a script tonight but my computer froze again.... these files are just too big :( 
2018-03-05 00:21:37	Arun	Ah, I see. Yeah please run it tomorrow and let me know how it runs against our data. :slightly_smiling_face: Thanks Jesse 
2018-03-05 00:21:58	Arun	And also, do you want my script for name comparison as well? 
2018-03-05 07:13:07	jesse	yes plz. anything would help. 
2018-03-05 10:25:10	Arun	Okay, I will slightly modify whatever I?ve coded and send you in sometime. 
2018-03-05 10:25:10		I?m not working on it right now, but I?ll send you! Is that okay? 
2018-03-05 10:25:36	jesse	yeah. 
2018-03-05 10:25:40	jesse	Thanks 
2018-03-05 16:44:45	Arun	@Arun uploaded a file: https://ncstateuniversityitng.slack.com/files/U95TJ10M9/F9JBZ2HND/comparenames.py (compareNames.py) 
2018-03-06 14:54:17	Arun	Hey Jesse, I am so sorry, I have an important interview this Thursday and thus I am unable to work on it, as I have to prepare myself for the interview. I hope you understand and its alright. I will be back only by Thursday night. 
2018-03-06 14:56:03	jesse	yeah I got you. just means more money for me :stuck_out_tongue: 
2018-03-06 14:56:44	jesse	I might get Michael or meaghan to help code some of this up too. xD 
2018-03-08 18:51:24	Arun	Hi Jesse. 
2018-03-08 18:51:30	Arun	How you doing? 
2018-03-08 18:51:57	Arun	Is there anything that you want me to work on? I can work on it tomorrow 
2018-03-08 19:34:53	jesse	hey dude. ya know that list, YetAnotherMedicalSchoolList? 
2018-03-08 19:41:28	jesse	I would like the medical schools, all 404 of them  to have which state that they came from. This will be a big help with the comparisons.
2018-03-08 19:41:28		right now, I only have a program that gets the NC comparisons. this was done for the sake of efficiency... the program as it is takes 30 mins to run. with all 50 states, its gonna take 24 hours if we generate sql statements for all of them.... this is still far better than the estimated 600 days that a nested for loop would cause. 
2018-03-08 19:42:18	jesse	and I'm doing alright. i needed to run the pubmed data once more which kinda sucks. 
2018-03-09 02:45:49	Arun	YetAnotherMedicalSchoolList? I am not aware of that list 
2018-03-09 03:11:18	Arun	Oh, we have created all the databases now? 
2018-03-09 08:01:13	jesse	oh sorry i mustve spoken to sagar about that one 
2018-03-09 08:02:08	jesse	we dont have all the databases now since i got one generating right now. its the pubmed junk again. 
2018-03-09 08:03:20	jesse	YetAnotherMedicalSchoolList is something where I took all of the specialists medical schools and filtered out all the duplicates. its in the google drive 
2018-03-09 08:04:01	jesse	there were a few different lists of medical schools at this point, so thats what I decided to call it. 
2018-03-09 08:12:22	jesse	I've also got a program for checking for matches in the med schools. we need that program to match as many as possible without doing something complex like n grams... i think. if we do the ngrams, our program will take forever to run... although it may be feasible for just NC. 
2018-03-09 08:13:02	jesse	if you'd like to try to upgrade that program, feel free. 
2018-03-09 08:18:48	jesse	if you want to see those 2 programs, theyre in power6a under/home/jlsimps4/ForTheGreatAndPowerfulMichael/
2018-03-09 08:18:48		since michael was wanting to look into them.
2018-03-09 08:18:48		they require a database for the specialists and the pubmed stuff, so you can find those csvs in the ForMeaghan folder... to convert between the two, you can just use a psql \copy statement 
2018-03-09 19:23:01	Arun	Hey Jesse, I?m just checking out your messages. So comparing med schools, you have written a separate script? 
2018-03-09 19:24:02	Arun	And, you took the YetAnotherMedicalSchoolList from the already available specialist data ( that website you sent me previously) , I believe? 
2018-03-09 19:34:00	jesse	yep. the scripts are in the pubmed-crawler folder in the rarediseases repo 
2018-03-09 19:35:33	Arun	Okay I will look into it!  
2018-03-09 19:36:58	Arun	So, you want me to do which state does these universities/medical school come from eh?  
2018-03-09 19:38:46	jesse	yeah. preferably the two letter code. NC for north carolina. I asked sagar to look at the same thing so you may want to message him. And maybe put messages in the patientportalpeeps channel since I've had to repeat myself for both you and Sagar. 
2018-03-10 15:18:08	Arun	Alright I will talk to Sagar and check where he is 
2018-03-10 21:39:13	Arun	Hey. I checked with Sagar, he said he is good with doing that part. So, is there something else I could work on?  
2018-03-10 21:40:53	jesse	have you seen the script for the medschool comparisons ? 
2018-03-10 21:51:09	jesse	There are 2, getPhysicianPubmedConnection.py and compareMedSchools.py
2018-03-10 21:51:09		We are no longer deleting the duplicates from the pubmed dataset because we are keeping the disease ids with the articles... What this means is that it will take longer for the program  to run. We need to make it more efficient if possible.
2018-03-10 21:51:09		As for the second file, we need to do whatever we can to get more medical schools to match... this could be achieved by doing Ngrams or by removing more nonsense words. 
2018-03-10 21:51:09		and last of all, you can check if Janne needs help with the drug companies. I havent heard back from her.
2018-03-10 21:51:09		That is all I would know to do. There are also some issues you could look into on github. 
2018-03-10 21:55:19	jesse	Also stuff about Mesh terms when gathering the pubmed data... but I think we should hold off on that until we figure out  how to get these comparisons efficiently. [:+1:1] 
2018-03-11 14:39:29	Arun	I did check those scripts recently, but I will do go through it again today or tomorrow, to start looking into it. I will look at the compareMedSchools.py and see what we can we do it make it match better. 
2018-03-11 14:40:21	Arun	And yes, I will check with Janne too, and see if she is doing okay. 
2018-04-12 13:45:44	jesse	Hey Arun, in the meeting today, it seemed like you finished whatever you were doing, and the team wanted you to help me out with researching the Alternative Medicines. We don't really have any leads on that, just need to find out what sources are good for that and what we can scrape. 
2018-04-12 13:46:20	Arun	Hi Jesse, I was just about to ping you regarding the same  
2018-04-12 13:46:59	Arun	So, I need to look out for data on alternative medicines? 
2018-04-12 13:49:41	jesse	yep. do google searches, or whatever you can to build up a list of websites that we can scrape data from. 
2018-04-12 13:49:58	Arun	Yes, I can do that  
2018-04-12 13:51:01	jesse	I'll be doing the same thing, so let me know if you find anything, and I will let you know if I find anything. If we find something good enough to scrape, then we can focus on that, but for now, lets just get links. 
2018-04-12 15:08:33	Arun	Okaaay sure, sounds good  
2018-04-16 20:35:57	jesse	Hey Arun, have you been looking into alternative medicine resources? 
2018-04-17 11:51:27		getting channel history...
2018-02-16 19:22:18	Arun	Great, that is perfect!  
2018-02-16 19:22:36	Arun	Is there any significance for the date field? 
2018-02-16 19:23:13	Arun	Other than just to sort the articles chronologically? 
2018-02-16 19:27:21	jesse	not really. My thinking was just that a date might be nice to have. If 2 articles are about the same rare_dx, then maybe the newer one might be more credible. but this would just be a side objective. A better solution is to find some sort of id field, since we already have a table in a database for pubmed stuff. (the problem with that table is that it only has the first initial of the last name or first name.) 
2018-02-16 19:30:15	Arun	Oh, I see. Where exactly is that database? In that http://power6.ncsu.edu (power6.ncsu.edu) machine? I mean, is there any other databases that we have? 
2018-02-16 19:32:21	jesse	on power6a in ncbi database 
2018-02-16 19:32:35	Arun	Okay okay cool. 
2018-02-16 19:33:19	Arun	And yeah, I am going through the script that you uploaded now. And I will also take a look at what Janne and Sagar has done 
2018-02-16 19:34:01	jesse	this was built off of what sagar did. I'm not sure Janne had anything worth pushing 
2018-02-16 19:37:20	jesse	the table for the pubmed rare diseases should not be counted on. it only has 1000 rows. I think we will have to create our own. 
2018-02-16 19:37:51	jesse	and they didn't even store date :disappointed: 
2018-02-16 19:41:47	Arun	Oh I see. Anyway, we do have the APIs to get the data right? For pubmed 
2018-02-16 19:42:12	jesse	thats what the Bio package at the top is. 
2018-02-16 19:42:28	Arun	Yeah right. Okay cool!  
2018-02-16 19:42:30	jesse	we basically have the data, but its kinda a blobby dictionary thats hard to get through 
2018-02-16 19:42:56	Arun	Ah, like that! Alright, got it  
2018-02-16 19:44:55	jesse	ok i got the date. I'm gonna push again if ya don't mind. 
2018-02-16 19:46:21	Arun	But anyway, if required, can we meet once on Sunday? Only if you are free  
2018-02-16 19:46:30	Arun	Awesome :grin: 
2018-02-16 19:46:38	jesse	yup. 
2018-02-16 19:47:37	jesse	ok i pushed the stuff. 
2018-02-16 19:47:41	Arun	So, I?ll go through everything and see if I?m able to understand everything that we?ve got! And Sunday I?ll ask you the questions if I have any, and we can probably sit together and get done with this part!  
2018-02-16 19:48:50	jesse	Sounds good. 
2018-02-17 21:28:14	Arun	Hey Jesse, Will you be free post lunch tomorrow? 
2018-02-18 07:54:57	jesse	yeah 
2018-02-18 11:11:16	Arun	Great, shall we meet at 4pm today then? For about 1-2 hours maximum  
2018-02-18 11:20:23	jesse	Sounds good. I've been doing quite a bit of work to this script. for the most part, I just need to let you know what my current code gathers, the errors I'm running into, what needs to be done with the outputted CSV files, and stuff like that. My thinking is after we meet at 4, I can hand the rest of the work concerning pubmed stuff to you, and I can then switch to working on the drug company data and some of the other minor tasks. 
2018-02-18 14:38:33	Arun	Sure, I?ll be in Hunt grad commons. I?ve booked room number 4314  
2018-02-18 14:39:18	jesse	can undergrads go there? 
2018-02-18 14:40:01	Arun	Ah, I totally forgot about that! But I guess you can come inside if I'm with you 
2018-02-18 14:41:52	jesse	ok. are you there now or should i wait till 4? 
2018-02-18 14:42:16	Arun	I am here in library. We can meet now, sure! But the room is available only from 4 
2018-02-18 14:42:40	Arun	So, if you can find another room, I sure can come 
2018-02-18 14:46:44	jesse	I just checked. there is no room available that I can reserve.  
2018-02-18 14:47:03	Arun	Yeah, that's what I thought too! 
2018-02-18 14:47:29	Arun	Anyway, we can still meet now if you wish 
2018-02-18 14:52:32	jesse	sure. I'm just laying in my bed anyway. give me a few minutes to finish the current csv my computer is workin on and so I can make tea /get ready to leave 
2018-02-18 14:52:56	Arun	Yeah sure, take your time! :slightly_smiling_face: 
2018-02-18 15:03:18	jesse	im at the library now 
2018-02-18 15:03:46	Arun	Oh good. Can you come to 4th floor? I'll come near the lift 
2018-02-18 18:36:25	jesse	Did you specify in LibreOffice that the CSV's were comma separated when you opened it? 
2018-02-18 18:36:50	jesse	usually it says "separate by [] comma  [] semicolon [] space... etc 
2018-02-18 18:37:18	jesse	In the big CSV, I'm getting no entries that are overflowing. 
2018-02-18 18:39:05	jesse	Same with the little csv 
2018-02-18 18:40:22	Arun	Ah really? Damn, I didn?t notice that! But yeah, the next time I open it I?ll check that too 
2018-02-18 18:44:23	jesse	I'm gonna run the entire thing once more to try to locate the XML parsing error. hopefully I'll be able to narrow it down to a place and put a try/except thing around it to just skip the document if it fails to parse. 
2018-02-18 18:44:56	jesse	If you already have that stacktrace in your terminal, could you check the line number? 
2018-02-18 18:50:04	jesse	i think i'll just put an except around the search/query part. my guess is thats where the issue is. 
2018-02-18 18:58:01	Arun	Gimme sometime, I?ll check and let you know the line number  
2018-02-18 19:27:34	Arun	My new CSV is being generated now, and I cannot check back the stacktrace 
2018-02-18 19:27:51	jesse	thats ok. I've got a CSV generating myself. 
2018-02-18 19:28:38	jesse	quick trick: if you run "tmux" you can detach the terminal so that you can close out of the terminal and do other things while the program is being run in the background. [:+1:1 :heavy_check_mark:1] 
2018-02-18 21:16:47	jesse	I got the full csv and it's beautiful 
2018-02-18 21:17:20	jesse	i mean, its what you'd expect... a csv, but I've been working quite hard just to get it lol 
2018-02-18 21:23:57	jesse	also, I don't think I pulled your changes, since you removed the fun stuff like abstract and title 
2018-02-19 18:23:21	jesse	Hey Arun, you have yurika working on your computer right? 
2018-02-19 18:23:45	jesse	Janne was wanting to use it for getting info on drug companies. 
2018-02-19 20:40:41	Arun	Hey yeah, I have it in Running! Sorry, for the late reply  
2018-02-19 20:41:27	Arun	Janne wants to use it? Sure, we can try using it. But the websites that we use should allow crawling  
2018-02-19 20:42:18	jesse	cool. I'm not sure what Janne needs. I was working with her tonight and the drug company information is chaos. I'll try to ask Janne and get her to message 
2018-02-19 20:42:19	jesse	you 
2018-02-19 20:42:35	Arun	Or I can ping Janne right away and save some time :)  
2018-02-19 20:43:08	jesse	cool! I hope it works out. 
2018-02-19 20:43:22	Arun	Alright, pinged her now!  
2018-02-19 20:44:11	jesse	Thanks dude. i tried it on my computer but i think postgresql is forever broke on my computer from trying to mess with agensgraph 
2018-02-19 20:44:58	Arun	Ah, I see! Alright, not an issue! Let?s see if we are able to get the data using Yurika  
2018-02-26 12:51:32	Arun	Hey Jesse, I just realized that I have some work for today evening. Is it alright if we push today's meeting to tomorrow? 
2018-02-26 12:58:37	jesse	i guess that depends on everyone else. i could probably meet both today and tomorrow and not run out of things to do. 
2018-02-26 12:59:04	Arun	Okay, If others are making it, I'll try to make it too! 
2018-02-26 12:59:56	jesse	ok. if not, I can just let you know what happens, whether its by text or meeting up tomorrow. 
2018-02-26 13:00:39	Arun	Alright, that's great! I'll keep you posted :slightly_smiling_face: 
2018-02-27 09:06:59	jesse	Hey Arun, I met up with Sagar last night, and Janne separately. we've got a few issues with the pubmed stuff.
2018-02-27 09:06:59		I'll give ya a quick run down:
2018-02-27 09:06:59		our pubmed data filtered everyone who were affiliated with medical schools in NC
2018-02-27 09:06:59		our specialist data filtered everyone whos hospital was in NC.
2018-02-27 09:06:59		issue 1.   many people work in NC hospitals and have their medical degrees from places outside of NC.
2018-02-27 09:06:59		but lets ignore that for now.
2018-02-27 09:06:59		issue 2. the medical schools in the pubmed data is not uniform with the specialists data for schools they came from. matching UNC Chapel Hill would be fairly easy since Chapel Hill is unique... but take North Carolina State University... filter out the unnecessary words like "north carolina" and "university" and your left with ..."state"... which doesnt help. also consider that many pubmed researchers dont seem to be affiliated with a university or school of medicine... but rather just a lab...
2018-02-27 09:06:59		Back to Issue 1. If we want to fix this, we would be looking to scrape all of the pubmed data  rather than just NC (an estimated 300hr process with extra hours for filtering duplicates.)   alternatively, we could just  not filter the specialists at all but this comes with its own risks. (still preferable but it leads us back to issue 2.)
2018-02-27 09:06:59		As for Janne, she's been working hard scraping the drug company data. sadly a good amount of her work  must be done manually. 
2018-02-27 15:29:47	Arun	Hey Jesse, just seeing your message now. Thanks for the update! 
2018-02-27 15:31:00	Arun	Regarding issue 1, we can try to write a write to check if we are getting data properly, say upto 1000 or 10000 rows. Once we are sure about the script, we can request a machine to Meaghan and we can run our script in that machine, instead of running in our personal machine 
2018-02-27 15:42:01	jesse	that sounds reasonable, but it may be better if we could just download the entire pubmed data set rather than webscraping: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/databases/download/pubmed_medline.html
2018-02-27 15:42:01		I'm not sure if this would be too much memory or not, but they also have daily update files so we wouldn't have to re-download it every time... we would just need a way to convert the xml to postgresql... [:+1:1] 
2018-02-27 15:48:34	Arun	Oh yeah, I didnt know we could download the data directly. 
2018-02-27 15:49:28	Arun	Btw, for this week I am yet to clock in and start working on specialist-disease relation 
2018-02-27 15:49:48	jesse	ya wanna task? 
2018-02-27 15:50:02	Arun	I've been busy with my stuff. I guess I will be able to work a maximum of only 8-10 hours this week and next week 
2018-02-27 15:50:53	Arun	I will try writing the script to manipulate the name according to the pubmed data and see if I can find matches 
2018-02-27 15:51:03	Arun	Once I am done with that work, I can work on other task 
2018-02-27 15:51:28	jesse	hold on with that. 
2018-02-27 15:51:46	Arun	Are you sure about it? 
2018-02-27 15:52:01	Arun	I can hold on it and work on something more important if there is any 
2018-02-27 15:54:13	jesse	part of this past meeting was that since we cannot just match first and last name, since many first names are not full names... So we wanted to link them to their universities. So if a person with the last name of Hayes went to Chapel Hill in pubmed, we could say that they are the same person who is listed in specialists as Hayes who went to Chapel Hill. Do ya follow? 
2018-02-27 15:54:49	Arun	Okay, I get it. Yeah, it makes sense 
2018-02-27 15:56:05	jesse	Also, If we download the entire pubmed thing... and somehow make it into a pubmed database, we will need to modify whatever script you were planning on writing. 
2018-02-27 15:56:28	Arun	But, Is it the only way to confirm if two persons are the same? Is there other possibilities to confirm that. I was thinking something like, if the name is Mathew Hayes and we have M Hayes, chances that they both are same is quite high, whats your thought on that? 
2018-02-27 15:58:23	jesse	we could check firstname too... but ideally we would want M Hayes from Chapel Hill === Mathew Hayes from Chapel Hill... If we are opening up all of pubmed to all of the specialists in the united states... then first and last name is no longer accurate enough.. since there are a ton of mathew hayes from the united states whereas maybe not so much with just NC. 
2018-02-27 15:58:50	Arun	Yeah agreed! 
2018-02-27 16:00:22	Arun	But since there are way too many pubmed data and too many specialists too, the computation could take more time when we start comparing different fields simulatenously, I thought. 
2018-02-27 16:00:22		But nevertheless, what you said would definitely work :slightly_smiling_face: 
2018-02-27 16:04:28	jesse	it would take more time, but it would maybe be a couple hour process just from a rough estimate i think 
2018-02-27 16:04:46	jesse	I'll still need to confirm with Kowolenko before we actually try to do this [:+1:1] 
2018-02-27 16:25:19	Arun	Yeah thats right. And Okay, so meanwhile what do you want me to work on? 
2018-02-27 16:28:18	jesse	I think you should look into trying to find a way to compare the medical school names and see if the medical school names in the specialists match with the pubmed affiliations. 
2018-02-27 16:40:26	Arun	Okay, I will look at that today and let you know when I am done with it 
2018-02-27 16:41:25	jesse	xD I wouldn't expect you to be done with it. but let me know what your thinking about that problem. Also figured we should clarify that for the specialists, we are referring to the data from http://medicare.gov (medicare.gov) rather than the other specialist data we gathered. 
2018-02-27 16:43:07	Arun	Ahh, I see. Alright. I will look into that website and see what data we've got. And yeah, I will let you know my thoughts before I actually start coding it 
2018-02-27 16:46:31	jesse	https://data.medicare.gov/Physician-Compare/Physician-Compare-National-Downloadable-File/mj5m-pzi6
2018-02-27 16:46:31		Physician Compare National Downloadable File | Data.Medicare.gov
2018-02-27 16:46:31		Physician Compare National Downloadable File - The Physician Compare National Downloadable File is organized at the individual eligible professional level; each line is unique at the professional/enrollment record/Group Practice/address level. Professionals with multiple Medicare enrollment records and/or single enrollments linking to multiple practice location addresses are listed on multiple lines. [:heavy_check_mark:1 :+1:1 :slightly_smiling_face:1] 
2018-02-27 20:13:11	jesse	Hey Arun, have you been working on that problem? ^^ 
2018-02-27 20:13:48	Arun	Not yet Jesse, I was planning to look at it tonight post dinner 
2018-02-27 20:14:50	jesse	ahh I gotcha. I was just wonderin. I'm trying to decide what I wanna do, whether it's eat dinner, work on this, or go back to my apartment and play a video game :stuck_out_tongue: 
2018-02-27 20:38:51	Arun	Haha, sometime  of video game wouldn't hurt anything I believe! :smile: 
2018-02-27 21:09:54	jesse	sadly I chose to work on another project :disappointed: 
2018-02-28 13:25:40	Arun	Hey Jesse, afternoon! So, I checked out the website and also the pubmed data. What you said makes sense. 
2018-02-28 13:25:40		And once we make all the necessary calculations, we could probably try to sort the list with current NC specialist coming on the top and then in the order of nearest states wrt NC 
2018-02-28 13:26:39	Arun	But we are expected to finish all this by next thursday? 
2018-02-28 13:29:05	jesse	did you read the messages on the rarediseases channel? 
2018-02-28 13:29:16	Arun	Yes I did 
2018-02-28 13:29:29	Arun	I just checked out the messages there 
2018-02-28 13:32:14	jesse	i gotcha. yeah we are supposed to have something to show off by next thursday. I'm thinking the only truly difficult task we will have to deal with is comparing the names of the medical schools.  If we have to download all of the pubmed data, we will have a lot more troubles, which is why I'm going to try to run the script without the NC filter and see if it takes significantly more time or not. 
2018-02-28 13:34:42	Arun	Okay that would be a start. Do you want us to meet anytime this week or weekend? I fear I won't be available next week starting Monday :disappointed: 
2018-02-28 13:35:34	jesse	I'm going to charlotte starting thursday night up until next sunday... I won't be able to meet. I can do google hangouts though... but thats not as helpful 
2018-02-28 13:37:12	Arun	Ah, I see. Alright then, we will figure it out. But let's split up the work and finish it off as much as possible. 
2018-02-28 13:38:05	Arun	One question, why do you want to strip out the University names? Like, you were saying NC State University will result in 'state' which is not of any use. But, why do we have to it? 
2018-02-28 13:44:01	jesse	agreed. I'll have more information tonight... so it'll be clearer what all we need to do by the meeting time tomorrow. No matter what though, we need to find a way to compare the University names.
2018-02-28 13:44:01		As for that, the names of the affiliations in the pubmed data are not the same as the medical schools in the specialists data. We need to find a way to connect people on first/lastname (easy) and then by the university... my thought was that we could strip away some of the meaningless words so that we could match the names of the schools... but that won't work for the above reason you mentioned. Ingrams aren't too great either since swapping North Carolina State University also could match University of North Carolina State.
2018-02-28 13:44:01		Don't get too fixated on things that I say. I'm just trying to get you to understand the problem.  If you can find a way to keep all of the words in and determine that two schools are the same, all power to ya. 
2018-02-28 13:47:57	Arun	Haha, agreed. I understand you are trying to explain me the problem. :slightly_smiling_face: 
2018-02-28 13:50:23	Arun	And alright, meanwhile, let me know if you need anything! 
2018-02-28 13:50:40	jesse	Sure thing. 
2018-03-01 14:03:57	jesse	I posted the notes/todo thing I made for the week. take a look at that and then you can ask me if you have any questions. 
2018-03-01 20:16:16	Arun	Hey, I just had a look at it now. 
2018-03-01 20:19:33	Arun	I see there are immediate stuffs to get done with regard to matching physicians with pubmed data. Will you be working on any task particularly? 
2018-03-01 21:17:22	jesse	i havent decided the order Ill start tackling these things yet. sorry i didnt respond. i was driving 
2018-03-01 21:18:27	Arun	No worries! :slightly_smiling_face: And, let me know how we can go about it, if you got any leads 
2018-03-04 01:18:58	Arun	Hey, so for comparing the affiliation from pubmed and physician's medical school name, we can probably just check if medical school name is present in pubmed affiliation. 
2018-03-04 01:18:58		For example, as far as I noticed, the Physician's medical school name is pretty organised, but pubmed affiliations seem to have lot of redundant names.
2018-03-04 01:18:58		In this method, we can convert the physician's medical school name to an array and check if all the elements of the array is in pubmed affiliation. If so, we can assure that they both are the same person. 
2018-03-04 01:18:58		What do you think about this? 
2018-03-04 01:22:05	Arun	And for us to match physicians data from pubmed and physician data, the fastest method would be to put it in a DB and then querying it. 
2018-03-04 09:12:58	jesse	Hey Arun, I agree that the pubmed data is scattered and that the physician data is more organized and condensed. however, I dont think it will be enough to just check if the physician med school is in the affiliation.
2018-03-04 09:12:58		Have you taken a look at certain schools that would and would not match under this scenario? If you have, and you are comfortable with the results that gives, then sure... but im thinking we may need to worry about ngrams and abbreviations.
2018-03-04 09:12:58		Ive been trying to compile a list of all schools contained in the pubmed data and sort them, but it's been running for twelve hours and I dont think itll finish. maybe i should try a much smaller dataset.. 
2018-03-04 09:18:25	jesse	I've got a list  of the affiliations that came from diseases beginning with X-Z 
2018-03-04 09:19:24	jesse	maybe we can use that and the list of med schools from the physician data to help us determine a good matching system. 
2018-03-04 09:30:50	jesse	I also had Sagar working a lil bit on this. I gave him a list of 400 med school names that came from the physician data and had him make abbreviations for each one. (i hope he wrote a program to do this lol) 
2018-03-04 12:00:15	Arun	Right, and for matching two med school names, I can probably write a script that would take care of abbreviations too. It will be very similar to the script I wrote for comparing names in any order 
2018-03-04 12:06:22	jesse	ok. if you can, try to make it so that we arent loading the entire CSVs into the script.
2018-03-04 12:06:22		many of these files are gigabytes of text, so we will run out of memory if we do that. 
2018-03-04 12:15:54	Arun	Right, well I?m sure of how to do that part. Like, I can read from the CSV and for each line in the CSV, I will have to read from the physician?s CSV. But, in this way, for each ?row? in the pubmed, I will be reading all the rows from the physician CSV, every time. 
2018-03-04 12:15:54		Is there any other way that you know of? 
2018-03-04 12:16:11	Arun	I mean, I?m *not sure of how to do that part 
2018-03-04 12:30:35	jesse	I'm not sure either. 
2018-03-04 12:39:42	jesse	I'm gonna try to filter out the duplicates out of the pubmed data once again and see what the file size is. 
2018-03-04 12:56:03	jesse	Are you working on raredx stuff right now? 
2018-03-04 12:58:02	Arun	I'm guessing the best way to go forward would be to put it on a DB and query data. 
2018-03-04 12:58:52	Arun	Anyway, I am not working on it right now. 
2018-03-04 13:07:09	jesse	put what specifically on the db? 
2018-03-04 13:07:34	Arun	Both, the pubmed data and the physician data. Instead of having it on a CSV 
2018-03-04 13:09:25	Arun	Do you believe our searching would be faster that way? 
2018-03-04 13:15:59	jesse	I'm not sure it would matter. once pandas loads it into memory, it doesn't matter. if you were thinking of doing some sort of join statement or some python thing that worked directly with psql, then it would be faster. 
2018-03-04 15:08:59	Arun	Yeah, thats true too, alright then 
2018-03-04 20:08:59	jesse	arun, do you have a script for the medschool comparison? 
2018-03-04 21:03:00	Arun	Hey, I will send you in sometime, like half hour? I am on my way home now from outside 
2018-03-04 21:03:51	jesse	sounds good 
2018-03-04 22:23:18	Arun	Hi Jesse :slightly_smiling_face: 
2018-03-04 22:24:51	Arun	Can I send the script here? 
2018-03-04 22:27:56	Arun	@Arun uploaded a file: https://ncstateuniversityitng.slack.com/files/U95TJ10M9/F9JFZ3Z45/comparemednames.py (compareMedNames.py) and commented: Script that compares Medical School Names from pubmed data and physcian data 
2018-03-04 22:30:22	Arun	I ran this script by taking names manually form the pubmed csv and the physician data. And it worked fine for the names I used. 
2018-03-04 22:31:42	Arun	I wouldn't say this script works very fine.  There will definitely be some good amount of false positive. But since we are already comparing the names, and this is more like a second factor to affirm our decision if two persons are the same, I'm hoping this would work fine. 
2018-03-04 22:36:20	Arun	@Arun uploaded a file: https://ncstateuniversityitng.slack.com/files/U95TJ10M9/F9JBS09T6/pip_package_for_fuzzywuzzy.txt (pip package for fuzzywuzzy) and commented: Forgot to mention, you need to install the fuzzywuzzy package for this. 
2018-03-04 23:04:26	jesse	I'll take a look tomorrow. i appreciate it dude. i tried to run a script tonight but my computer froze again.... these files are just too big :( 
2018-03-05 00:21:37	Arun	Ah, I see. Yeah please run it tomorrow and let me know how it runs against our data. :slightly_smiling_face: Thanks Jesse 
2018-03-05 00:21:58	Arun	And also, do you want my script for name comparison as well? 
2018-03-05 07:13:07	jesse	yes plz. anything would help. 
2018-03-05 10:25:10	Arun	Okay, I will slightly modify whatever I?ve coded and send you in sometime. 
2018-03-05 10:25:10		I?m not working on it right now, but I?ll send you! Is that okay? 
2018-03-05 10:25:36	jesse	yeah. 
2018-03-05 10:25:40	jesse	Thanks 
2018-03-05 16:44:45	Arun	@Arun uploaded a file: https://ncstateuniversityitng.slack.com/files/U95TJ10M9/F9JBZ2HND/comparenames.py (compareNames.py) 
2018-03-06 14:54:17	Arun	Hey Jesse, I am so sorry, I have an important interview this Thursday and thus I am unable to work on it, as I have to prepare myself for the interview. I hope you understand and its alright. I will be back only by Thursday night. 
2018-03-06 14:56:03	jesse	yeah I got you. just means more money for me :stuck_out_tongue: 
2018-03-06 14:56:44	jesse	I might get Michael or meaghan to help code some of this up too. xD 
2018-03-08 18:51:24	Arun	Hi Jesse. 
2018-03-08 18:51:30	Arun	How you doing? 
2018-03-08 18:51:57	Arun	Is there anything that you want me to work on? I can work on it tomorrow 
2018-03-08 19:34:53	jesse	hey dude. ya know that list, YetAnotherMedicalSchoolList? 
2018-03-08 19:41:28	jesse	I would like the medical schools, all 404 of them  to have which state that they came from. This will be a big help with the comparisons.
2018-03-08 19:41:28		right now, I only have a program that gets the NC comparisons. this was done for the sake of efficiency... the program as it is takes 30 mins to run. with all 50 states, its gonna take 24 hours if we generate sql statements for all of them.... this is still far better than the estimated 600 days that a nested for loop would cause. 
2018-03-08 19:42:18	jesse	and I'm doing alright. i needed to run the pubmed data once more which kinda sucks. 
2018-03-09 02:45:49	Arun	YetAnotherMedicalSchoolList? I am not aware of that list 
2018-03-09 03:11:18	Arun	Oh, we have created all the databases now? 
2018-03-09 08:01:13	jesse	oh sorry i mustve spoken to sagar about that one 
2018-03-09 08:02:08	jesse	we dont have all the databases now since i got one generating right now. its the pubmed junk again. 
2018-03-09 08:03:20	jesse	YetAnotherMedicalSchoolList is something where I took all of the specialists medical schools and filtered out all the duplicates. its in the google drive 
2018-03-09 08:04:01	jesse	there were a few different lists of medical schools at this point, so thats what I decided to call it. 
2018-03-09 08:12:22	jesse	I've also got a program for checking for matches in the med schools. we need that program to match as many as possible without doing something complex like n grams... i think. if we do the ngrams, our program will take forever to run... although it may be feasible for just NC. 
2018-03-09 08:13:02	jesse	if you'd like to try to upgrade that program, feel free. 
2018-03-09 08:18:48	jesse	if you want to see those 2 programs, theyre in power6a under/home/jlsimps4/ForTheGreatAndPowerfulMichael/
2018-03-09 08:18:48		since michael was wanting to look into them.
2018-03-09 08:18:48		they require a database for the specialists and the pubmed stuff, so you can find those csvs in the ForMeaghan folder... to convert between the two, you can just use a psql \copy statement 
2018-03-09 19:23:01	Arun	Hey Jesse, I?m just checking out your messages. So comparing med schools, you have written a separate script? 
2018-03-09 19:24:02	Arun	And, you took the YetAnotherMedicalSchoolList from the already available specialist data ( that website you sent me previously) , I believe? 
2018-03-09 19:34:00	jesse	yep. the scripts are in the pubmed-crawler folder in the rarediseases repo 
2018-03-09 19:35:33	Arun	Okay I will look into it!  
2018-03-09 19:36:58	Arun	So, you want me to do which state does these universities/medical school come from eh?  
2018-03-09 19:38:46	jesse	yeah. preferably the two letter code. NC for north carolina. I asked sagar to look at the same thing so you may want to message him. And maybe put messages in the patientportalpeeps channel since I've had to repeat myself for both you and Sagar. 
2018-03-10 15:18:08	Arun	Alright I will talk to Sagar and check where he is 
2018-03-10 21:39:13	Arun	Hey. I checked with Sagar, he said he is good with doing that part. So, is there something else I could work on?  
2018-03-10 21:40:53	jesse	have you seen the script for the medschool comparisons ? 
2018-03-10 21:51:09	jesse	There are 2, getPhysicianPubmedConnection.py and compareMedSchools.py
2018-03-10 21:51:09		We are no longer deleting the duplicates from the pubmed dataset because we are keeping the disease ids with the articles... What this means is that it will take longer for the program  to run. We need to make it more efficient if possible.
2018-03-10 21:51:09		As for the second file, we need to do whatever we can to get more medical schools to match... this could be achieved by doing Ngrams or by removing more nonsense words. 
2018-03-10 21:51:09		and last of all, you can check if Janne needs help with the drug companies. I havent heard back from her.
2018-03-10 21:51:09		That is all I would know to do. There are also some issues you could look into on github. 
2018-03-10 21:55:19	jesse	Also stuff about Mesh terms when gathering the pubmed data... but I think we should hold off on that until we figure out  how to get these comparisons efficiently. [:+1:1] 
2018-03-11 14:39:29	Arun	I did check those scripts recently, but I will do go through it again today or tomorrow, to start looking into it. I will look at the compareMedSchools.py and see what we can we do it make it match better. 
2018-03-11 14:40:21	Arun	And yes, I will check with Janne too, and see if she is doing okay. 
2018-04-12 13:45:44	jesse	Hey Arun, in the meeting today, it seemed like you finished whatever you were doing, and the team wanted you to help me out with researching the Alternative Medicines. We don't really have any leads on that, just need to find out what sources are good for that and what we can scrape. 
2018-04-12 13:46:20	Arun	Hi Jesse, I was just about to ping you regarding the same  
2018-04-12 13:46:59	Arun	So, I need to look out for data on alternative medicines? 
2018-04-12 13:49:41	jesse	yep. do google searches, or whatever you can to build up a list of websites that we can scrape data from. 
2018-04-12 13:49:58	Arun	Yes, I can do that  
2018-04-12 13:51:01	jesse	I'll be doing the same thing, so let me know if you find anything, and I will let you know if I find anything. If we find something good enough to scrape, then we can focus on that, but for now, lets just get links. 
2018-04-12 15:08:33	Arun	Okaaay sure, sounds good  
2018-04-16 20:35:57	jesse	Hey Arun, have you been looking into alternative medicine resources? 
2018-04-17 03:47:28	Arun	Hey sorry Jesse, I was held up with my project work for the DevOps course and I am done with that just now. I will be working on it from today (Tuesday) evening  
2018-04-17 12:49:20	jesse	sorry I thought I responded to this. That's fine. I've found a few resources if you want me to give them to ya. However, I'm just trying to think about how we can turn that into something helpful to visitors of our websites, since terminology is very different in the herbal remedy world. 
2018-04-17 12:49:43	jesse	Best resources I have seen 
2018-04-17 12:49:43	jesse	https://www.drugs.com/npp/ -- professionals 
2018-04-17 12:49:43	jesse	https://www.drugs.com/npc/ -- consumers 
2018-04-17 12:49:43	jesse	http://www.holisticonline.com/Herbal-Med/Hol_Herb_Info_Common_Names_A.htm 
2018-04-19 16:43:47		getting channel history...
2018-02-16 19:33:19	Arun	And yeah, I am going through the script that you uploaded now. And I will also take a look at what Janne and Sagar has done 
2018-02-16 19:34:01	jesse	this was built off of what sagar did. I'm not sure Janne had anything worth pushing 
2018-02-16 19:37:20	jesse	the table for the pubmed rare diseases should not be counted on. it only has 1000 rows. I think we will have to create our own. 
2018-02-16 19:37:51	jesse	and they didn't even store date :disappointed: 
2018-02-16 19:41:47	Arun	Oh I see. Anyway, we do have the APIs to get the data right? For pubmed 
2018-02-16 19:42:12	jesse	thats what the Bio package at the top is. 
2018-02-16 19:42:28	Arun	Yeah right. Okay cool!  
2018-02-16 19:42:30	jesse	we basically have the data, but its kinda a blobby dictionary thats hard to get through 
2018-02-16 19:42:56	Arun	Ah, like that! Alright, got it  
2018-02-16 19:44:55	jesse	ok i got the date. I'm gonna push again if ya don't mind. 
2018-02-16 19:46:21	Arun	But anyway, if required, can we meet once on Sunday? Only if you are free  
2018-02-16 19:46:30	Arun	Awesome :grin: 
2018-02-16 19:46:38	jesse	yup. 
2018-02-16 19:47:37	jesse	ok i pushed the stuff. 
2018-02-16 19:47:41	Arun	So, I?ll go through everything and see if I?m able to understand everything that we?ve got! And Sunday I?ll ask you the questions if I have any, and we can probably sit together and get done with this part!  
2018-02-16 19:48:50	jesse	Sounds good. 
2018-02-17 21:28:14	Arun	Hey Jesse, Will you be free post lunch tomorrow? 
2018-02-18 07:54:57	jesse	yeah 
2018-02-18 11:11:16	Arun	Great, shall we meet at 4pm today then? For about 1-2 hours maximum  
2018-02-18 11:20:23	jesse	Sounds good. I've been doing quite a bit of work to this script. for the most part, I just need to let you know what my current code gathers, the errors I'm running into, what needs to be done with the outputted CSV files, and stuff like that. My thinking is after we meet at 4, I can hand the rest of the work concerning pubmed stuff to you, and I can then switch to working on the drug company data and some of the other minor tasks. 
2018-02-18 14:38:33	Arun	Sure, I?ll be in Hunt grad commons. I?ve booked room number 4314  
2018-02-18 14:39:18	jesse	can undergrads go there? 
2018-02-18 14:40:01	Arun	Ah, I totally forgot about that! But I guess you can come inside if I'm with you 
2018-02-18 14:41:52	jesse	ok. are you there now or should i wait till 4? 
2018-02-18 14:42:16	Arun	I am here in library. We can meet now, sure! But the room is available only from 4 
2018-02-18 14:42:40	Arun	So, if you can find another room, I sure can come 
2018-02-18 14:46:44	jesse	I just checked. there is no room available that I can reserve.  
2018-02-18 14:47:03	Arun	Yeah, that's what I thought too! 
2018-02-18 14:47:29	Arun	Anyway, we can still meet now if you wish 
2018-02-18 14:52:32	jesse	sure. I'm just laying in my bed anyway. give me a few minutes to finish the current csv my computer is workin on and so I can make tea /get ready to leave 
2018-02-18 14:52:56	Arun	Yeah sure, take your time! :slightly_smiling_face: 
2018-02-18 15:03:18	jesse	im at the library now 
2018-02-18 15:03:46	Arun	Oh good. Can you come to 4th floor? I'll come near the lift 
2018-02-18 18:36:25	jesse	Did you specify in LibreOffice that the CSV's were comma separated when you opened it? 
2018-02-18 18:36:50	jesse	usually it says "separate by [] comma  [] semicolon [] space... etc 
2018-02-18 18:37:18	jesse	In the big CSV, I'm getting no entries that are overflowing. 
2018-02-18 18:39:05	jesse	Same with the little csv 
2018-02-18 18:40:22	Arun	Ah really? Damn, I didn?t notice that! But yeah, the next time I open it I?ll check that too 
2018-02-18 18:44:23	jesse	I'm gonna run the entire thing once more to try to locate the XML parsing error. hopefully I'll be able to narrow it down to a place and put a try/except thing around it to just skip the document if it fails to parse. 
2018-02-18 18:44:56	jesse	If you already have that stacktrace in your terminal, could you check the line number? 
2018-02-18 18:50:04	jesse	i think i'll just put an except around the search/query part. my guess is thats where the issue is. 
2018-02-18 18:58:01	Arun	Gimme sometime, I?ll check and let you know the line number  
2018-02-18 19:27:34	Arun	My new CSV is being generated now, and I cannot check back the stacktrace 
2018-02-18 19:27:51	jesse	thats ok. I've got a CSV generating myself. 
2018-02-18 19:28:38	jesse	quick trick: if you run "tmux" you can detach the terminal so that you can close out of the terminal and do other things while the program is being run in the background. [:+1:1 :heavy_check_mark:1] 
2018-02-18 21:16:47	jesse	I got the full csv and it's beautiful 
2018-02-18 21:17:20	jesse	i mean, its what you'd expect... a csv, but I've been working quite hard just to get it lol 
2018-02-18 21:23:57	jesse	also, I don't think I pulled your changes, since you removed the fun stuff like abstract and title 
2018-02-19 18:23:21	jesse	Hey Arun, you have yurika working on your computer right? 
2018-02-19 18:23:45	jesse	Janne was wanting to use it for getting info on drug companies. 
2018-02-19 20:40:41	Arun	Hey yeah, I have it in Running! Sorry, for the late reply  
2018-02-19 20:41:27	Arun	Janne wants to use it? Sure, we can try using it. But the websites that we use should allow crawling  
2018-02-19 20:42:18	jesse	cool. I'm not sure what Janne needs. I was working with her tonight and the drug company information is chaos. I'll try to ask Janne and get her to message 
2018-02-19 20:42:19	jesse	you 
2018-02-19 20:42:35	Arun	Or I can ping Janne right away and save some time :)  
2018-02-19 20:43:08	jesse	cool! I hope it works out. 
2018-02-19 20:43:22	Arun	Alright, pinged her now!  
2018-02-19 20:44:11	jesse	Thanks dude. i tried it on my computer but i think postgresql is forever broke on my computer from trying to mess with agensgraph 
2018-02-19 20:44:58	Arun	Ah, I see! Alright, not an issue! Let?s see if we are able to get the data using Yurika  
2018-02-26 12:51:32	Arun	Hey Jesse, I just realized that I have some work for today evening. Is it alright if we push today's meeting to tomorrow? 
2018-02-26 12:58:37	jesse	i guess that depends on everyone else. i could probably meet both today and tomorrow and not run out of things to do. 
2018-02-26 12:59:04	Arun	Okay, If others are making it, I'll try to make it too! 
2018-02-26 12:59:56	jesse	ok. if not, I can just let you know what happens, whether its by text or meeting up tomorrow. 
2018-02-26 13:00:39	Arun	Alright, that's great! I'll keep you posted :slightly_smiling_face: 
2018-02-27 09:06:59	jesse	Hey Arun, I met up with Sagar last night, and Janne separately. we've got a few issues with the pubmed stuff.
2018-02-27 09:06:59		I'll give ya a quick run down:
2018-02-27 09:06:59		our pubmed data filtered everyone who were affiliated with medical schools in NC
2018-02-27 09:06:59		our specialist data filtered everyone whos hospital was in NC.
2018-02-27 09:06:59		issue 1.   many people work in NC hospitals and have their medical degrees from places outside of NC.
2018-02-27 09:06:59		but lets ignore that for now.
2018-02-27 09:06:59		issue 2. the medical schools in the pubmed data is not uniform with the specialists data for schools they came from. matching UNC Chapel Hill would be fairly easy since Chapel Hill is unique... but take North Carolina State University... filter out the unnecessary words like "north carolina" and "university" and your left with ..."state"... which doesnt help. also consider that many pubmed researchers dont seem to be affiliated with a university or school of medicine... but rather just a lab...
2018-02-27 09:06:59		Back to Issue 1. If we want to fix this, we would be looking to scrape all of the pubmed data  rather than just NC (an estimated 300hr process with extra hours for filtering duplicates.)   alternatively, we could just  not filter the specialists at all but this comes with its own risks. (still preferable but it leads us back to issue 2.)
2018-02-27 09:06:59		As for Janne, she's been working hard scraping the drug company data. sadly a good amount of her work  must be done manually. 
2018-02-27 15:29:47	Arun	Hey Jesse, just seeing your message now. Thanks for the update! 
2018-02-27 15:31:00	Arun	Regarding issue 1, we can try to write a write to check if we are getting data properly, say upto 1000 or 10000 rows. Once we are sure about the script, we can request a machine to Meaghan and we can run our script in that machine, instead of running in our personal machine 
2018-02-27 15:42:01	jesse	that sounds reasonable, but it may be better if we could just download the entire pubmed data set rather than webscraping: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/databases/download/pubmed_medline.html
2018-02-27 15:42:01		I'm not sure if this would be too much memory or not, but they also have daily update files so we wouldn't have to re-download it every time... we would just need a way to convert the xml to postgresql... [:+1:1] 
2018-02-27 15:48:34	Arun	Oh yeah, I didnt know we could download the data directly. 
2018-02-27 15:49:28	Arun	Btw, for this week I am yet to clock in and start working on specialist-disease relation 
2018-02-27 15:49:48	jesse	ya wanna task? 
2018-02-27 15:50:02	Arun	I've been busy with my stuff. I guess I will be able to work a maximum of only 8-10 hours this week and next week 
2018-02-27 15:50:53	Arun	I will try writing the script to manipulate the name according to the pubmed data and see if I can find matches 
2018-02-27 15:51:03	Arun	Once I am done with that work, I can work on other task 
2018-02-27 15:51:28	jesse	hold on with that. 
2018-02-27 15:51:46	Arun	Are you sure about it? 
2018-02-27 15:52:01	Arun	I can hold on it and work on something more important if there is any 
2018-02-27 15:54:13	jesse	part of this past meeting was that since we cannot just match first and last name, since many first names are not full names... So we wanted to link them to their universities. So if a person with the last name of Hayes went to Chapel Hill in pubmed, we could say that they are the same person who is listed in specialists as Hayes who went to Chapel Hill. Do ya follow? 
2018-02-27 15:54:49	Arun	Okay, I get it. Yeah, it makes sense 
2018-02-27 15:56:05	jesse	Also, If we download the entire pubmed thing... and somehow make it into a pubmed database, we will need to modify whatever script you were planning on writing. 
2018-02-27 15:56:28	Arun	But, Is it the only way to confirm if two persons are the same? Is there other possibilities to confirm that. I was thinking something like, if the name is Mathew Hayes and we have M Hayes, chances that they both are same is quite high, whats your thought on that? 
2018-02-27 15:58:23	jesse	we could check firstname too... but ideally we would want M Hayes from Chapel Hill === Mathew Hayes from Chapel Hill... If we are opening up all of pubmed to all of the specialists in the united states... then first and last name is no longer accurate enough.. since there are a ton of mathew hayes from the united states whereas maybe not so much with just NC. 
2018-02-27 15:58:50	Arun	Yeah agreed! 
2018-02-27 16:00:22	Arun	But since there are way too many pubmed data and too many specialists too, the computation could take more time when we start comparing different fields simulatenously, I thought. 
2018-02-27 16:00:22		But nevertheless, what you said would definitely work :slightly_smiling_face: 
2018-02-27 16:04:28	jesse	it would take more time, but it would maybe be a couple hour process just from a rough estimate i think 
2018-02-27 16:04:46	jesse	I'll still need to confirm with Kowolenko before we actually try to do this [:+1:1] 
2018-02-27 16:25:19	Arun	Yeah thats right. And Okay, so meanwhile what do you want me to work on? 
2018-02-27 16:28:18	jesse	I think you should look into trying to find a way to compare the medical school names and see if the medical school names in the specialists match with the pubmed affiliations. 
2018-02-27 16:40:26	Arun	Okay, I will look at that today and let you know when I am done with it 
2018-02-27 16:41:25	jesse	xD I wouldn't expect you to be done with it. but let me know what your thinking about that problem. Also figured we should clarify that for the specialists, we are referring to the data from http://medicare.gov (medicare.gov) rather than the other specialist data we gathered. 
2018-02-27 16:43:07	Arun	Ahh, I see. Alright. I will look into that website and see what data we've got. And yeah, I will let you know my thoughts before I actually start coding it 
2018-02-27 16:46:31	jesse	https://data.medicare.gov/Physician-Compare/Physician-Compare-National-Downloadable-File/mj5m-pzi6

[:heavy_check_mark:1 :+1:1 :slightly_smiling_face:1] 
2018-02-27 20:13:11	jesse	Hey Arun, have you been working on that problem? ^^ 
2018-02-27 20:13:48	Arun	Not yet Jesse, I was planning to look at it tonight post dinner 
2018-02-27 20:14:50	jesse	ahh I gotcha. I was just wonderin. I'm trying to decide what I wanna do, whether it's eat dinner, work on this, or go back to my apartment and play a video game :stuck_out_tongue: 
2018-02-27 20:38:51	Arun	Haha, sometime  of video game wouldn't hurt anything I believe! :smile: 
2018-02-27 21:09:54	jesse	sadly I chose to work on another project :disappointed: 
2018-02-28 13:25:40	Arun	Hey Jesse, afternoon! So, I checked out the website and also the pubmed data. What you said makes sense. 
2018-02-28 13:25:40		And once we make all the necessary calculations, we could probably try to sort the list with current NC specialist coming on the top and then in the order of nearest states wrt NC 
2018-02-28 13:26:39	Arun	But we are expected to finish all this by next thursday? 
2018-02-28 13:29:05	jesse	did you read the messages on the rarediseases channel? 
2018-02-28 13:29:16	Arun	Yes I did 
2018-02-28 13:29:29	Arun	I just checked out the messages there 
2018-02-28 13:32:14	jesse	i gotcha. yeah we are supposed to have something to show off by next thursday. I'm thinking the only truly difficult task we will have to deal with is comparing the names of the medical schools.  If we have to download all of the pubmed data, we will have a lot more troubles, which is why I'm going to try to run the script without the NC filter and see if it takes significantly more time or not. 
2018-02-28 13:34:42	Arun	Okay that would be a start. Do you want us to meet anytime this week or weekend? I fear I won't be available next week starting Monday :disappointed: 
2018-02-28 13:35:34	jesse	I'm going to charlotte starting thursday night up until next sunday... I won't be able to meet. I can do google hangouts though... but thats not as helpful 
2018-02-28 13:37:12	Arun	Ah, I see. Alright then, we will figure it out. But let's split up the work and finish it off as much as possible. 
2018-02-28 13:38:05	Arun	One question, why do you want to strip out the University names? Like, you were saying NC State University will result in 'state' which is not of any use. But, why do we have to it? 
2018-02-28 13:44:01	jesse	agreed. I'll have more information tonight... so it'll be clearer what all we need to do by the meeting time tomorrow. No matter what though, we need to find a way to compare the University names.
2018-02-28 13:44:01		As for that, the names of the affiliations in the pubmed data are not the same as the medical schools in the specialists data. We need to find a way to connect people on first/lastname (easy) and then by the university... my thought was that we could strip away some of the meaningless words so that we could match the names of the schools... but that won't work for the above reason you mentioned. Ingrams aren't too great either since swapping North Carolina State University also could match University of North Carolina State.
2018-02-28 13:44:01		Don't get too fixated on things that I say. I'm just trying to get you to understand the problem.  If you can find a way to keep all of the words in and determine that two schools are the same, all power to ya. 
2018-02-28 13:47:57	Arun	Haha, agreed. I understand you are trying to explain me the problem. :slightly_smiling_face: 
2018-02-28 13:50:23	Arun	And alright, meanwhile, let me know if you need anything! 
2018-02-28 13:50:40	jesse	Sure thing. 
2018-03-01 14:03:57	jesse	I posted the notes/todo thing I made for the week. take a look at that and then you can ask me if you have any questions. 
2018-03-01 20:16:16	Arun	Hey, I just had a look at it now. 
2018-03-01 20:19:33	Arun	I see there are immediate stuffs to get done with regard to matching physicians with pubmed data. Will you be working on any task particularly? 
2018-03-01 21:17:22	jesse	i havent decided the order Ill start tackling these things yet. sorry i didnt respond. i was driving 
2018-03-01 21:18:27	Arun	No worries! :slightly_smiling_face: And, let me know how we can go about it, if you got any leads 
2018-03-04 01:18:58	Arun	Hey, so for comparing the affiliation from pubmed and physician's medical school name, we can probably just check if medical school name is present in pubmed affiliation. 
2018-03-04 01:18:58		For example, as far as I noticed, the Physician's medical school name is pretty organised, but pubmed affiliations seem to have lot of redundant names.
2018-03-04 01:18:58		In this method, we can convert the physician's medical school name to an array and check if all the elements of the array is in pubmed affiliation. If so, we can assure that they both are the same person. 
2018-03-04 01:18:58		What do you think about this? 
2018-03-04 01:22:05	Arun	And for us to match physicians data from pubmed and physician data, the fastest method would be to put it in a DB and then querying it. 
2018-03-04 09:12:58	jesse	Hey Arun, I agree that the pubmed data is scattered and that the physician data is more organized and condensed. however, I dont think it will be enough to just check if the physician med school is in the affiliation.
2018-03-04 09:12:58		Have you taken a look at certain schools that would and would not match under this scenario? If you have, and you are comfortable with the results that gives, then sure... but im thinking we may need to worry about ngrams and abbreviations.
2018-03-04 09:12:58		Ive been trying to compile a list of all schools contained in the pubmed data and sort them, but it's been running for twelve hours and I dont think itll finish. maybe i should try a much smaller dataset.. 
2018-03-04 09:18:25	jesse	I've got a list  of the affiliations that came from diseases beginning with X-Z 
2018-03-04 09:19:24	jesse	maybe we can use that and the list of med schools from the physician data to help us determine a good matching system. 
2018-03-04 09:30:50	jesse	I also had Sagar working a lil bit on this. I gave him a list of 400 med school names that came from the physician data and had him make abbreviations for each one. (i hope he wrote a program to do this lol) 
2018-03-04 12:00:15	Arun	Right, and for matching two med school names, I can probably write a script that would take care of abbreviations too. It will be very similar to the script I wrote for comparing names in any order 
2018-03-04 12:06:22	jesse	ok. if you can, try to make it so that we arent loading the entire CSVs into the script.
2018-03-04 12:06:22		many of these files are gigabytes of text, so we will run out of memory if we do that. 
2018-03-04 12:15:54	Arun	Right, well I?m sure of how to do that part. Like, I can read from the CSV and for each line in the CSV, I will have to read from the physician?s CSV. But, in this way, for each ?row? in the pubmed, I will be reading all the rows from the physician CSV, every time. 
2018-03-04 12:15:54		Is there any other way that you know of? 
2018-03-04 12:16:11	Arun	I mean, I?m *not sure of how to do that part 
2018-03-04 12:30:35	jesse	I'm not sure either. 
2018-03-04 12:39:42	jesse	I'm gonna try to filter out the duplicates out of the pubmed data once again and see what the file size is. 
2018-03-04 12:56:03	jesse	Are you working on raredx stuff right now? 
2018-03-04 12:58:02	Arun	I'm guessing the best way to go forward would be to put it on a DB and query data. 
2018-03-04 12:58:52	Arun	Anyway, I am not working on it right now. 
2018-03-04 13:07:09	jesse	put what specifically on the db? 
2018-03-04 13:07:34	Arun	Both, the pubmed data and the physician data. Instead of having it on a CSV 
2018-03-04 13:09:25	Arun	Do you believe our searching would be faster that way? 
2018-03-04 13:15:59	jesse	I'm not sure it would matter. once pandas loads it into memory, it doesn't matter. if you were thinking of doing some sort of join statement or some python thing that worked directly with psql, then it would be faster. 
2018-03-04 15:08:59	Arun	Yeah, thats true too, alright then 
2018-03-04 20:08:59	jesse	arun, do you have a script for the medschool comparison? 
2018-03-04 21:03:00	Arun	Hey, I will send you in sometime, like half hour? I am on my way home now from outside 
2018-03-04 21:03:51	jesse	sounds good 
2018-03-04 22:23:18	Arun	Hi Jesse :slightly_smiling_face: 
2018-03-04 22:24:51	Arun	Can I send the script here? 
2018-03-04 22:27:56	Arun	@Arun uploaded a file: https://ncstateuniversityitng.slack.com/files/U95TJ10M9/F9JFZ3Z45/comparemednames.py (compareMedNames.py) and commented: Script that compares Medical School Names from pubmed data and physcian data 
2018-03-04 22:30:22	Arun	I ran this script by taking names manually form the pubmed csv and the physician data. And it worked fine for the names I used. 
2018-03-04 22:31:42	Arun	I wouldn't say this script works very fine.  There will definitely be some good amount of false positive. But since we are already comparing the names, and this is more like a second factor to affirm our decision if two persons are the same, I'm hoping this would work fine. 
2018-03-04 22:36:20	Arun	@Arun uploaded a file: https://ncstateuniversityitng.slack.com/files/U95TJ10M9/F9JBS09T6/pip_package_for_fuzzywuzzy.txt (pip package for fuzzywuzzy) and commented: Forgot to mention, you need to install the fuzzywuzzy package for this. 
2018-03-04 23:04:26	jesse	I'll take a look tomorrow. i appreciate it dude. i tried to run a script tonight but my computer froze again.... these files are just too big :( 
2018-03-05 00:21:37	Arun	Ah, I see. Yeah please run it tomorrow and let me know how it runs against our data. :slightly_smiling_face: Thanks Jesse 
2018-03-05 00:21:58	Arun	And also, do you want my script for name comparison as well? 
2018-03-05 07:13:07	jesse	yes plz. anything would help. 
2018-03-05 10:25:10	Arun	Okay, I will slightly modify whatever I?ve coded and send you in sometime. 
2018-03-05 10:25:10		I?m not working on it right now, but I?ll send you! Is that okay? 
2018-03-05 10:25:36	jesse	yeah. 
2018-03-05 10:25:40	jesse	Thanks 
2018-03-05 16:44:45	Arun	@Arun uploaded a file: https://ncstateuniversityitng.slack.com/files/U95TJ10M9/F9JBZ2HND/comparenames.py (compareNames.py) 
2018-03-06 14:54:17	Arun	Hey Jesse, I am so sorry, I have an important interview this Thursday and thus I am unable to work on it, as I have to prepare myself for the interview. I hope you understand and its alright. I will be back only by Thursday night. 
2018-03-06 14:56:03	jesse	yeah I got you. just means more money for me :stuck_out_tongue: 
2018-03-06 14:56:44	jesse	I might get Michael or meaghan to help code some of this up too. xD 
2018-03-08 18:51:24	Arun	Hi Jesse. 
2018-03-08 18:51:30	Arun	How you doing? 
2018-03-08 18:51:57	Arun	Is there anything that you want me to work on? I can work on it tomorrow 
2018-03-08 19:34:53	jesse	hey dude. ya know that list, YetAnotherMedicalSchoolList? 
2018-03-08 19:41:28	jesse	I would like the medical schools, all 404 of them  to have which state that they came from. This will be a big help with the comparisons.
2018-03-08 19:41:28		right now, I only have a program that gets the NC comparisons. this was done for the sake of efficiency... the program as it is takes 30 mins to run. with all 50 states, its gonna take 24 hours if we generate sql statements for all of them.... this is still far better than the estimated 600 days that a nested for loop would cause. 
2018-03-08 19:42:18	jesse	and I'm doing alright. i needed to run the pubmed data once more which kinda sucks. 
2018-03-09 02:45:49	Arun	YetAnotherMedicalSchoolList? I am not aware of that list 
2018-03-09 03:11:18	Arun	Oh, we have created all the databases now? 
2018-03-09 08:01:13	jesse	oh sorry i mustve spoken to sagar about that one 
2018-03-09 08:02:08	jesse	we dont have all the databases now since i got one generating right now. its the pubmed junk again. 
2018-03-09 08:03:20	jesse	YetAnotherMedicalSchoolList is something where I took all of the specialists medical schools and filtered out all the duplicates. its in the google drive 
2018-03-09 08:04:01	jesse	there were a few different lists of medical schools at this point, so thats what I decided to call it. 
2018-03-09 08:12:22	jesse	I've also got a program for checking for matches in the med schools. we need that program to match as many as possible without doing something complex like n grams... i think. if we do the ngrams, our program will take forever to run... although it may be feasible for just NC. 
2018-03-09 08:13:02	jesse	if you'd like to try to upgrade that program, feel free. 
2018-03-09 08:18:48	jesse	if you want to see those 2 programs, theyre in power6a under/home/jlsimps4/ForTheGreatAndPowerfulMichael/
2018-03-09 08:18:48		since michael was wanting to look into them.
2018-03-09 08:18:48		they require a database for the specialists and the pubmed stuff, so you can find those csvs in the ForMeaghan folder... to convert between the two, you can just use a psql \copy statement 
2018-03-09 19:23:01	Arun	Hey Jesse, I?m just checking out your messages. So comparing med schools, you have written a separate script? 
2018-03-09 19:24:02	Arun	And, you took the YetAnotherMedicalSchoolList from the already available specialist data ( that website you sent me previously) , I believe? 
2018-03-09 19:34:00	jesse	yep. the scripts are in the pubmed-crawler folder in the rarediseases repo 
2018-03-09 19:35:33	Arun	Okay I will look into it!  
2018-03-09 19:36:58	Arun	So, you want me to do which state does these universities/medical school come from eh?  
2018-03-09 19:38:46	jesse	yeah. preferably the two letter code. NC for north carolina. I asked sagar to look at the same thing so you may want to message him. And maybe put messages in the patientportalpeeps channel since I've had to repeat myself for both you and Sagar. 
2018-03-10 15:18:08	Arun	Alright I will talk to Sagar and check where he is 
2018-03-10 21:39:13	Arun	Hey. I checked with Sagar, he said he is good with doing that part. So, is there something else I could work on?  
2018-03-10 21:40:53	jesse	have you seen the script for the medschool comparisons ? 
2018-03-10 21:51:09	jesse	There are 2, getPhysicianPubmedConnection.py and compareMedSchools.py
2018-03-10 21:51:09		We are no longer deleting the duplicates from the pubmed dataset because we are keeping the disease ids with the articles... What this means is that it will take longer for the program  to run. We need to make it more efficient if possible.
2018-03-10 21:51:09		As for the second file, we need to do whatever we can to get more medical schools to match... this could be achieved by doing Ngrams or by removing more nonsense words. 
2018-03-10 21:51:09		and last of all, you can check if Janne needs help with the drug companies. I havent heard back from her.
2018-03-10 21:51:09		That is all I would know to do. There are also some issues you could look into on github. 
2018-03-10 21:55:19	jesse	Also stuff about Mesh terms when gathering the pubmed data... but I think we should hold off on that until we figure out  how to get these comparisons efficiently. [:+1:1] 
2018-03-11 14:39:29	Arun	I did check those scripts recently, but I will do go through it again today or tomorrow, to start looking into it. I will look at the compareMedSchools.py and see what we can we do it make it match better. 
2018-03-11 14:40:21	Arun	And yes, I will check with Janne too, and see if she is doing okay. 
2018-04-12 13:45:44	jesse	Hey Arun, in the meeting today, it seemed like you finished whatever you were doing, and the team wanted you to help me out with researching the Alternative Medicines. We don't really have any leads on that, just need to find out what sources are good for that and what we can scrape. 
2018-04-12 13:46:20	Arun	Hi Jesse, I was just about to ping you regarding the same  
2018-04-12 13:46:59	Arun	So, I need to look out for data on alternative medicines? 
2018-04-12 13:49:41	jesse	yep. do google searches, or whatever you can to build up a list of websites that we can scrape data from. 
2018-04-12 13:49:58	Arun	Yes, I can do that  
2018-04-12 13:51:01	jesse	I'll be doing the same thing, so let me know if you find anything, and I will let you know if I find anything. If we find something good enough to scrape, then we can focus on that, but for now, lets just get links. 
2018-04-12 15:08:33	Arun	Okaaay sure, sounds good  
2018-04-16 20:35:57	jesse	Hey Arun, have you been looking into alternative medicine resources? 
2018-04-17 03:47:28	Arun	Hey sorry Jesse, I was held up with my project work for the DevOps course and I am done with that just now. I will be working on it from today (Tuesday) evening  
2018-04-17 12:49:20	jesse	sorry I thought I responded to this. That's fine. I've found a few resources if you want me to give them to ya. However, I'm just trying to think about how we can turn that into something helpful to visitors of our websites, since terminology is very different in the herbal remedy world.

2018-02-16 19:34:01	jesse	this was built off of what sagar did. I'm not sure Janne had anything worth pushing 
2018-02-16 19:37:20	jesse	the table for the pubmed rare diseases should not be counted on. it only has 1000 rows. I think we will have to create our own. 
2018-02-16 19:37:51	jesse	and they didn't even store date :disappointed: 
2018-02-16 19:41:47	Arun	Oh I see. Anyway, we do have the APIs to get the data right? For pubmed 
2018-02-16 19:42:12	jesse	thats what the Bio package at the top is. 
2018-02-16 19:42:28	Arun	Yeah right. Okay cool!  
2018-02-16 19:42:30	jesse	we basically have the data, but its kinda a blobby dictionary thats hard to get through 
2018-02-16 19:42:56	Arun	Ah, like that! Alright, got it  
2018-02-16 19:44:55	jesse	ok i got the date. I'm gonna push again if ya don't mind. 
2018-02-16 19:46:21	Arun	But anyway, if required, can we meet once on Sunday? Only if you are free  
2018-02-16 19:46:30	Arun	Awesome :grin: 
2018-02-16 19:46:38	jesse	yup. 
2018-02-16 19:47:37	jesse	ok i pushed the stuff. 
2018-02-16 19:47:41	Arun	So, I?ll go through everything and see if I?m able to understand everything that we?ve got! And Sunday I?ll ask you the questions if I have any, and we can probably sit together and get done with this part!  
2018-02-16 19:48:50	jesse	Sounds good. 
2018-02-17 21:28:14	Arun	Hey Jesse, Will you be free post lunch tomorrow? 
2018-02-18 07:54:57	jesse	yeah 
2018-02-18 11:11:16	Arun	Great, shall we meet at 4pm today then? For about 1-2 hours maximum  
2018-02-18 11:20:23	jesse	Sounds good. I've been doing quite a bit of work to this script. for the most part, I just need to let you know what my current code gathers, the errors I'm running into, what needs to be done with the outputted CSV files, and stuff like that. My thinking is after we meet at 4, I can hand the rest of the work concerning pubmed stuff to you, and I can then switch to working on the drug company data and some of the other minor tasks. 
2018-02-18 14:38:33	Arun	Sure, I?ll be in Hunt grad commons. I?ve booked room number 4314  
2018-02-18 14:39:18	jesse	can undergrads go there? 
2018-02-18 14:40:01	Arun	Ah, I totally forgot about that! But I guess you can come inside if I'm with you 
2018-02-18 14:41:52	jesse	ok. are you there now or should i wait till 4? 
2018-02-18 14:42:16	Arun	I am here in library. We can meet now, sure! But the room is available only from 4 
2018-02-18 14:42:40	Arun	So, if you can find another room, I sure can come 
2018-02-18 14:46:44	jesse	I just checked. there is no room available that I can reserve.  
2018-02-18 14:47:03	Arun	Yeah, that's what I thought too! 
2018-02-18 14:47:29	Arun	Anyway, we can still meet now if you wish 
2018-02-18 14:52:32	jesse	sure. I'm just laying in my bed anyway. give me a few minutes to finish the current csv my computer is workin on and so I can make tea /get ready to leave 
2018-02-18 14:52:56	Arun	Yeah sure, take your time! :slightly_smiling_face: 
2018-02-18 15:03:18	jesse	im at the library now 
2018-02-18 15:03:46	Arun	Oh good. Can you come to 4th floor? I'll come near the lift 
2018-02-18 18:36:25	jesse	Did you specify in LibreOffice that the CSV's were comma separated when you opened it? 
2018-02-18 18:36:50	jesse	usually it says "separate by [] comma  [] semicolon [] space... etc 
2018-02-18 18:37:18	jesse	In the big CSV, I'm getting no entries that are overflowing. 
2018-02-18 18:39:05	jesse	Same with the little csv 
2018-02-18 18:40:22	Arun	Ah really? Damn, I didn?t notice that! But yeah, the next time I open it I?ll check that too 
2018-02-18 18:44:23	jesse	I'm gonna run the entire thing once more to try to locate the XML parsing error. hopefully I'll be able to narrow it down to a place and put a try/except thing around it to just skip the document if it fails to parse. 
2018-02-18 18:44:56	jesse	If you already have that stacktrace in your terminal, could you check the line number? 
2018-02-18 18:50:04	jesse	i think i'll just put an except around the search/query part. my guess is thats where the issue is. 
2018-02-18 18:58:01	Arun	Gimme sometime, I?ll check and let you know the line number  
2018-02-18 19:27:34	Arun	My new CSV is being generated now, and I cannot check back the stacktrace 
2018-02-18 19:27:51	jesse	thats ok. I've got a CSV generating myself. 
2018-02-18 19:28:38	jesse	quick trick: if you run "tmux" you can detach the terminal so that you can close out of the terminal and do other things while the program is being run in the background. [:+1:1 :heavy_check_mark:1] 
2018-02-18 21:16:47	jesse	I got the full csv and it's beautiful 
2018-02-18 21:17:20	jesse	i mean, its what you'd expect... a csv, but I've been working quite hard just to get it lol 
2018-02-18 21:23:57	jesse	also, I don't think I pulled your changes, since you removed the fun stuff like abstract and title 
2018-02-19 18:23:21	jesse	Hey Arun, you have yurika working on your computer right? 
2018-02-19 18:23:45	jesse	Janne was wanting to use it for getting info on drug companies. 
2018-02-19 20:40:41	Arun	Hey yeah, I have it in Running! Sorry, for the late reply  
2018-02-19 20:41:27	Arun	Janne wants to use it? Sure, we can try using it. But the websites that we use should allow crawling  
2018-02-19 20:42:18	jesse	cool. I'm not sure what Janne needs. I was working with her tonight and the drug company information is chaos. I'll try to ask Janne and get her to message 
2018-02-19 20:42:19	jesse	you 
2018-02-19 20:42:35	Arun	Or I can ping Janne right away and save some time :)  
2018-02-19 20:43:08	jesse	cool! I hope it works out. 
2018-02-19 20:43:22	Arun	Alright, pinged her now!  
2018-02-19 20:44:11	jesse	Thanks dude. i tried it on my computer but i think postgresql is forever broke on my computer from trying to mess with agensgraph 
2018-02-19 20:44:58	Arun	Ah, I see! Alright, not an issue! Let?s see if we are able to get the data using Yurika  
2018-02-26 12:51:32	Arun	Hey Jesse, I just realized that I have some work for today evening. Is it alright if we push today's meeting to tomorrow? 
2018-02-26 12:58:37	jesse	i guess that depends on everyone else. i could probably meet both today and tomorrow and not run out of things to do. 
2018-02-26 12:59:04	Arun	Okay, If others are making it, I'll try to make it too! 
2018-02-26 12:59:56	jesse	ok. if not, I can just let you know what happens, whether its by text or meeting up tomorrow. 
2018-02-26 13:00:39	Arun	Alright, that's great! I'll keep you posted :slightly_smiling_face: 
2018-02-27 09:06:59	jesse	Hey Arun, I met up with Sagar last night, and Janne separately. we've got a few issues with the pubmed stuff.
2018-02-27 09:06:59		I'll give ya a quick run down:
2018-02-27 09:06:59		our pubmed data filtered everyone who were affiliated with medical schools in NC
2018-02-27 09:06:59		our specialist data filtered everyone whos hospital was in NC.
2018-02-27 09:06:59		issue 1.   many people work in NC hospitals and have their medical degrees from places outside of NC.
2018-02-27 09:06:59		but lets ignore that for now.
2018-02-27 09:06:59		issue 2. the medical schools in the pubmed data is not uniform with the specialists data for schools they came from. matching UNC Chapel Hill would be fairly easy since Chapel Hill is unique... but take North Carolina State University... filter out the unnecessary words like "north carolina" and "university" and your left with ..."state"... which doesnt help. also consider that many pubmed researchers dont seem to be affiliated with a university or school of medicine... but rather just a lab...
2018-02-27 09:06:59		Back to Issue 1. If we want to fix this, we would be looking to scrape all of the pubmed data  rather than just NC (an estimated 300hr process with extra hours for filtering duplicates.)   alternatively, we could just  not filter the specialists at all but this comes with its own risks. (still preferable but it leads us back to issue 2.)
2018-02-27 09:06:59		As for Janne, she's been working hard scraping the drug company data. sadly a good amount of her work  must be done manually. 
2018-02-27 15:29:47	Arun	Hey Jesse, just seeing your message now. Thanks for the update! 
2018-02-27 15:31:00	Arun	Regarding issue 1, we can try to write a write to check if we are getting data properly, say upto 1000 or 10000 rows. Once we are sure about the script, we can request a machine to Meaghan and we can run our script in that machine, instead of running in our personal machine 
2018-02-27 15:42:01	jesse	that sounds reasonable, but it may be better if we could just download the entire pubmed data set rather than webscraping: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/databases/download/pubmed_medline.html
2018-02-27 15:42:01		I'm not sure if this would be too much memory or not, but they also have daily update files so we wouldn't have to re-download it every time... we would just need a way to convert the xml to postgresql... [:+1:1] 
2018-02-27 15:48:34	Arun	Oh yeah, I didnt know we could download the data directly. 
2018-02-27 15:49:28	Arun	Btw, for this week I am yet to clock in and start working on specialist-disease relation 
2018-02-27 15:49:48	jesse	ya wanna task? 
2018-02-27 15:50:02	Arun	I've been busy with my stuff. I guess I will be able to work a maximum of only 8-10 hours this week and next week 
2018-02-27 15:50:53	Arun	I will try writing the script to manipulate the name according to the pubmed data and see if I can find matches 
2018-02-27 15:51:03	Arun	Once I am done with that work, I can work on other task 
2018-02-27 15:51:28	jesse	hold on with that. 
2018-02-27 15:51:46	Arun	Are you sure about it? 
2018-02-27 15:52:01	Arun	I can hold on it and work on something more important if there is any 
2018-02-27 15:54:13	jesse	part of this past meeting was that since we cannot just match first and last name, since many first names are not full names... So we wanted to link them to their universities. So if a person with the last name of Hayes went to Chapel Hill in pubmed, we could say that they are the same person who is listed in specialists as Hayes who went to Chapel Hill. Do ya follow? 
2018-02-27 15:54:49	Arun	Okay, I get it. Yeah, it makes sense 
2018-02-27 15:56:05	jesse	Also, If we download the entire pubmed thing... and somehow make it into a pubmed database, we will need to modify whatever script you were planning on writing. 
2018-02-27 15:56:28	Arun	But, Is it the only way to confirm if two persons are the same? Is there other possibilities to confirm that. I was thinking something like, if the name is Mathew Hayes and we have M Hayes, chances that they both are same is quite high, whats your thought on that? 
2018-02-27 15:58:23	jesse	we could check firstname too... but ideally we would want M Hayes from Chapel Hill === Mathew Hayes from Chapel Hill... If we are opening up all of pubmed to all of the specialists in the united states... then first and last name is no longer accurate enough.. since there are a ton of mathew hayes from the united states whereas maybe not so much with just NC. 
2018-02-27 15:58:50	Arun	Yeah agreed! 
2018-02-27 16:00:22	Arun	But since there are way too many pubmed data and too many specialists too, the computation could take more time when we start comparing different fields simulatenously, I thought. 
2018-02-27 16:00:22		But nevertheless, what you said would definitely work :slightly_smiling_face: 
2018-02-27 16:04:28	jesse	it would take more time, but it would maybe be a couple hour process just from a rough estimate i think 
2018-02-27 16:04:46	jesse	I'll still need to confirm with Kowolenko before we actually try to do this [:+1:1] 
2018-02-27 16:25:19	Arun	Yeah thats right. And Okay, so meanwhile what do you want me to work on? 
2018-02-27 16:28:18	jesse	I think you should look into trying to find a way to compare the medical school names and see if the medical school names in the specialists match with the pubmed affiliations. 
2018-02-27 16:40:26	Arun	Okay, I will look at that today and let you know when I am done with it 
2018-02-27 16:41:25	jesse	xD I wouldn't expect you to be done with it. but let me know what your thinking about that problem. Also figured we should clarify that for the specialists, we are referring to the data from http://medicare.gov (medicare.gov) rather than the other specialist data we gathered. 
2018-02-27 16:43:07	Arun	Ahh, I see. Alright. I will look into that website and see what data we've got. And yeah, I will let you know my thoughts before I actually start coding it 
2018-02-27 16:46:31	jesse	https://data.medicare.gov/Physician-Compare/Physician-Compare-National-Downloadable-File/mj5m-pzi6
2018-02-27 16:46:31		Physician Compare National Downloadable File | Data.Medicare.gov
2018-02-27 16:46:31		Physician Compare National Downloadable File - The Physician Compare National Downloadable File is organized at the individual eligible professional level; each line is unique at the professional/enrollment record/Group Practice/address level. Professionals with multiple Medicare enrollment records and/or single enrollments linking to multiple practice location addresses are listed on multiple lines. [:heavy_check_mark:1 :+1:1 :slightly_smiling_face:1] 
2018-02-27 20:13:11	jesse	Hey Arun, have you been working on that problem? ^^ 
2018-02-27 20:13:48	Arun	Not yet Jesse, I was planning to look at it tonight post dinner 
2018-02-27 20:14:50	jesse	ahh I gotcha. I was just wonderin. I'm trying to decide what I wanna do, whether it's eat dinner, work on this, or go back to my apartment and play a video game :stuck_out_tongue: 
2018-02-27 20:38:51	Arun	Haha, sometime  of video game wouldn't hurt anything I believe! :smile: 
2018-02-27 21:09:54	jesse	sadly I chose to work on another project :disappointed: 
2018-02-28 13:25:40	Arun	Hey Jesse, afternoon! So, I checked out the website and also the pubmed data. What you said makes sense. 
2018-02-28 13:25:40		And once we make all the necessary calculations, we could probably try to sort the list with current NC specialist coming on the top and then in the order of nearest states wrt NC 
2018-02-28 13:26:39	Arun	But we are expected to finish all this by next thursday? 
2018-02-28 13:29:05	jesse	did you read the messages on the rarediseases channel? 
2018-02-28 13:29:16	Arun	Yes I did 
2018-02-28 13:29:29	Arun	I just checked out the messages there 
2018-02-28 13:32:14	jesse	i gotcha. yeah we are supposed to have something to show off by next thursday. I'm thinking the only truly difficult task we will have to deal with is comparing the names of the medical schools.  If we have to download all of the pubmed data, we will have a lot more troubles, which is why I'm going to try to run the script without the NC filter and see if it takes significantly more time or not. 
2018-02-28 13:34:42	Arun	Okay that would be a start. Do you want us to meet anytime this week or weekend? I fear I won't be available next week starting Monday :disappointed: 
2018-02-28 13:35:34	jesse	I'm going to charlotte starting thursday night up until next sunday... I won't be able to meet. I can do google hangouts though... but thats not as helpful 
2018-02-28 13:37:12	Arun	Ah, I see. Alright then, we will figure it out. But let's split up the work and finish it off as much as possible. 
2018-02-28 13:38:05	Arun	One question, why do you want to strip out the University names? Like, you were saying NC State University will result in 'state' which is not of any use. But, why do we have to it? 
2018-02-28 13:44:01	jesse	agreed. I'll have more information tonight... so it'll be clearer what all we need to do by the meeting time tomorrow. No matter what though, we need to find a way to compare the University names.
2018-02-28 13:44:01		As for that, the names of the affiliations in the pubmed data are not the same as the medical schools in the specialists data. We need to find a way to connect people on first/lastname (easy) and then by the university... my thought was that we could strip away some of the meaningless words so that we could match the names of the schools... but that won't work for the above reason you mentioned. Ingrams aren't too great either since swapping North Carolina State University also could match University of North Carolina State.
2018-02-28 13:44:01		Don't get too fixated on things that I say. I'm just trying to get you to understand the problem.  If you can find a way to keep all of the words in and determine that two schools are the same, all power to ya. 
2018-02-28 13:47:57	Arun	Haha, agreed. I understand you are trying to explain me the problem. :slightly_smiling_face: 
2018-02-28 13:50:23	Arun	And alright, meanwhile, let me know if you need anything! 
2018-02-28 13:50:40	jesse	Sure thing. 
2018-03-01 14:03:57	jesse	I posted the notes/todo thing I made for the week. take a look at that and then you can ask me if you have any questions. 
2018-03-01 20:16:16	Arun	Hey, I just had a look at it now. 
2018-03-01 20:19:33	Arun	I see there are immediate stuffs to get done with regard to matching physicians with pubmed data. Will you be working on any task particularly? 
2018-03-01 21:17:22	jesse	i havent decided the order Ill start tackling these things yet. sorry i didnt respond. i was driving 
2018-03-01 21:18:27	Arun	No worries! :slightly_smiling_face: And, let me know how we can go about it, if you got any leads 
2018-03-04 01:18:58	Arun	Hey, so for comparing the affiliation from pubmed and physician's medical school name, we can probably just check if medical school name is present in pubmed affiliation. 
2018-03-04 01:18:58		For example, as far as I noticed, the Physician's medical school name is pretty organised, but pubmed affiliations seem to have lot of redundant names.
2018-03-04 01:18:58		In this method, we can convert the physician's medical school name to an array and check if all the elements of the array is in pubmed affiliation. If so, we can assure that they both are the same person. 
2018-03-04 01:18:58		What do you think about this? 
2018-03-04 01:22:05	Arun	And for us to match physicians data from pubmed and physician data, the fastest method would be to put it in a DB and then querying it. 
2018-03-04 09:12:58	jesse	Hey Arun, I agree that the pubmed data is scattered and that the physician data is more organized and condensed. however, I dont think it will be enough to just check if the physician med school is in the affiliation.
2018-03-04 09:12:58		Have you taken a look at certain schools that would and would not match under this scenario? If you have, and you are comfortable with the results that gives, then sure... but im thinking we may need to worry about ngrams and abbreviations.
2018-03-04 09:12:58		Ive been trying to compile a list of all schools contained in the pubmed data and sort them, but it's been running for twelve hours and I dont think itll finish. maybe i should try a much smaller dataset.. 
2018-03-04 09:18:25	jesse	I've got a list  of the affiliations that came from diseases beginning with X-Z 
2018-03-04 09:19:24	jesse	maybe we can use that and the list of med schools from the physician data to help us determine a good matching system. 
2018-03-04 09:30:50	jesse	I also had Sagar working a lil bit on this. I gave him a list of 400 med school names that came from the physician data and had him make abbreviations for each one. (i hope he wrote a program to do this lol) 
2018-03-04 12:00:15	Arun	Right, and for matching two med school names, I can probably write a script that would take care of abbreviations too. It will be very similar to the script I wrote for comparing names in any order 
2018-03-04 12:06:22	jesse	ok. if you can, try to make it so that we arent loading the entire CSVs into the script.
2018-03-04 12:06:22		many of these files are gigabytes of text, so we will run out of memory if we do that. 
2018-03-04 12:15:54	Arun	Right, well I?m sure of how to do that part. Like, I can read from the CSV and for each line in the CSV, I will have to read from the physician?s CSV. But, in this way, for each ?row? in the pubmed, I will be reading all the rows from the physician CSV, every time. 
2018-03-04 12:15:54		Is there any other way that you know of? 
2018-03-04 12:16:11	Arun	I mean, I?m *not sure of how to do that part 
2018-03-04 12:30:35	jesse	I'm not sure either. 
2018-03-04 12:39:42	jesse	I'm gonna try to filter out the duplicates out of the pubmed data once again and see what the file size is. 
2018-03-04 12:56:03	jesse	Are you working on raredx stuff right now? 
2018-03-04 12:58:02	Arun	I'm guessing the best way to go forward would be to put it on a DB and query data. 
2018-03-04 12:58:52	Arun	Anyway, I am not working on it right now. 
2018-03-04 13:07:09	jesse	put what specifically on the db? 
2018-03-04 13:07:34	Arun	Both, the pubmed data and the physician data. Instead of having it on a CSV 
2018-03-04 13:09:25	Arun	Do you believe our searching would be faster that way? 
2018-03-04 13:15:59	jesse	I'm not sure it would matter. once pandas loads it into memory, it doesn't matter. if you were thinking of doing some sort of join statement or some python thing that worked directly with psql, then it would be faster. 
2018-03-04 15:08:59	Arun	Yeah, thats true too, alright then 
2018-03-04 20:08:59	jesse	arun, do you have a script for the medschool comparison? 
2018-03-04 21:03:00	Arun	Hey, I will send you in sometime, like half hour? I am on my way home now from outside 
2018-03-04 21:03:51	jesse	sounds good 
2018-03-04 22:23:18	Arun	Hi Jesse :slightly_smiling_face: 
2018-03-04 22:24:51	Arun	Can I send the script here? 
2018-03-04 22:27:56	Arun	@Arun uploaded a file: https://ncstateuniversityitng.slack.com/files/U95TJ10M9/F9JFZ3Z45/comparemednames.py (compareMedNames.py) and commented: Script that compares Medical School Names from pubmed data and physcian data 
2018-03-04 22:30:22	Arun	I ran this script by taking names manually form the pubmed csv and the physician data. And it worked fine for the names I used. 
2018-03-04 22:31:42	Arun	I wouldn't say this script works very fine.  There will definitely be some good amount of false positive. But since we are already comparing the names, and this is more like a second factor to affirm our decision if two persons are the same, I'm hoping this would work fine. 
2018-03-04 22:36:20	Arun	@Arun uploaded a file: https://ncstateuniversityitng.slack.com/files/U95TJ10M9/F9JBS09T6/pip_package_for_fuzzywuzzy.txt (pip package for fuzzywuzzy) and commented: Forgot to mention, you need to install the fuzzywuzzy package for this. 
2018-03-04 23:04:26	jesse	I'll take a look tomorrow. i appreciate it dude. i tried to run a script tonight but my computer froze again.... these files are just too big :( 
2018-03-05 00:21:37	Arun	Ah, I see. Yeah please run it tomorrow and let me know how it runs against our data. :slightly_smiling_face: Thanks Jesse 
2018-03-05 00:21:58	Arun	And also, do you want my script for name comparison as well? 
2018-03-05 07:13:07	jesse	yes plz. anything would help. 
2018-03-05 10:25:10	Arun	Okay, I will slightly modify whatever I?ve coded and send you in sometime. 
2018-03-05 10:25:10		I?m not working on it right now, but I?ll send you! Is that okay? 
2018-03-05 10:25:36	jesse	yeah. 
2018-03-05 10:25:40	jesse	Thanks 
2018-03-05 16:44:45	Arun	@Arun uploaded a file: https://ncstateuniversityitng.slack.com/files/U95TJ10M9/F9JBZ2HND/comparenames.py (compareNames.py) 
2018-03-06 14:54:17	Arun	Hey Jesse, I am so sorry, I have an important interview this Thursday and thus I am unable to work on it, as I have to prepare myself for the interview. I hope you understand and its alright. I will be back only by Thursday night. 
2018-03-06 14:56:03	jesse	yeah I got you. just means more money for me :stuck_out_tongue: 
2018-03-06 14:56:44	jesse	I might get Michael or meaghan to help code some of this up too. xD 
2018-03-08 18:51:24	Arun	Hi Jesse. 
2018-03-08 18:51:30	Arun	How you doing? 
2018-03-08 18:51:57	Arun	Is there anything that you want me to work on? I can work on it tomorrow 
2018-03-08 19:34:53	jesse	hey dude. ya know that list, YetAnotherMedicalSchoolList? 
2018-03-08 19:41:28	jesse	I would like the medical schools, all 404 of them  to have which state that they came from. This will be a big help with the comparisons.
2018-03-08 19:41:28		right now, I only have a program that gets the NC comparisons. this was done for the sake of efficiency... the program as it is takes 30 mins to run. with all 50 states, its gonna take 24 hours if we generate sql statements for all of them.... this is still far better than the estimated 600 days that a nested for loop would cause. 
2018-03-08 19:42:18	jesse	and I'm doing alright. i needed to run the pubmed data once more which kinda sucks. 
2018-03-09 02:45:49	Arun	YetAnotherMedicalSchoolList? I am not aware of that list 
2018-03-09 03:11:18	Arun	Oh, we have created all the databases now? 
2018-03-09 08:01:13	jesse	oh sorry i mustve spoken to sagar about that one 
2018-03-09 08:02:08	jesse	we dont have all the databases now since i got one generating right now. its the pubmed junk again. 
2018-03-09 08:03:20	jesse	YetAnotherMedicalSchoolList is something where I took all of the specialists medical schools and filtered out all the duplicates. its in the google drive 
2018-03-09 08:04:01	jesse	there were a few different lists of medical schools at this point, so thats what I decided to call it. 
2018-03-09 08:12:22	jesse	I've also got a program for checking for matches in the med schools. we need that program to match as many as possible without doing something complex like n grams... i think. if we do the ngrams, our program will take forever to run... although it may be feasible for just NC. 
2018-03-09 08:13:02	jesse	if you'd like to try to upgrade that program, feel free. 
2018-03-09 08:18:48	jesse	if you want to see those 2 programs, theyre in power6a under/home/jlsimps4/ForTheGreatAndPowerfulMichael/
2018-03-09 08:18:48		since michael was wanting to look into them.
2018-03-09 08:18:48		they require a database for the specialists and the pubmed stuff, so you can find those csvs in the ForMeaghan folder... to convert between the two, you can just use a psql \copy statement 
2018-03-09 19:23:01	Arun	Hey Jesse, I?m just checking out your messages. So comparing med schools, you have written a separate script? 
2018-03-09 19:24:02	Arun	And, you took the YetAnotherMedicalSchoolList from the already available specialist data ( that website you sent me previously) , I believe? 
2018-03-09 19:34:00	jesse	yep. the scripts are in the pubmed-crawler folder in the rarediseases repo 
2018-03-09 19:35:33	Arun	Okay I will look into it!  
2018-03-09 19:36:58	Arun	So, you want me to do which state does these universities/medical school come from eh?  
2018-03-09 19:38:46	jesse	yeah. preferably the two letter code. NC for north carolina. I asked sagar to look at the same thing so you may want to message him. And maybe put messages in the patientportalpeeps channel since I've had to repeat myself for both you and Sagar. 
2018-03-10 15:18:08	Arun	Alright I will talk to Sagar and check where he is 
2018-03-10 21:39:13	Arun	Hey. I checked with Sagar, he said he is good with doing that part. So, is there something else I could work on?  
2018-03-10 21:40:53	jesse	have you seen the script for the medschool comparisons ? 
2018-03-10 21:51:09	jesse	There are 2, getPhysicianPubmedConnection.py and compareMedSchools.py
2018-03-10 21:51:09		We are no longer deleting the duplicates from the pubmed dataset because we are keeping the disease ids with the articles... What this means is that it will take longer for the program  to run. We need to make it more efficient if possible.
2018-03-10 21:51:09		As for the second file, we need to do whatever we can to get more medical schools to match... this could be achieved by doing Ngrams or by removing more nonsense words. 
2018-03-10 21:51:09		and last of all, you can check if Janne needs help with the drug companies. I havent heard back from her.
2018-03-10 21:51:09		That is all I would know to do. There are also some issues you could look into on github. 
2018-03-10 21:55:19	jesse	Also stuff about Mesh terms when gathering the pubmed data... but I think we should hold off on that until we figure out  how to get these comparisons efficiently. [:+1:1] 
2018-03-11 14:39:29	Arun	I did check those scripts recently, but I will do go through it again today or tomorrow, to start looking into it. I will look at the compareMedSchools.py and see what we can we do it make it match better. 
2018-03-11 14:40:21	Arun	And yes, I will check with Janne too, and see if she is doing okay. 
2018-04-12 13:45:44	jesse	Hey Arun, in the meeting today, it seemed like you finished whatever you were doing, and the team wanted you to help me out with researching the Alternative Medicines. We don't really have any leads on that, just need to find out what sources are good for that and what we can scrape. 
2018-04-12 13:46:20	Arun	Hi Jesse, I was just about to ping you regarding the same  
2018-04-12 13:46:59	Arun	So, I need to look out for data on alternative medicines? 
2018-04-12 13:49:41	jesse	yep. do google searches, or whatever you can to build up a list of websites that we can scrape data from. 
2018-04-12 13:49:58	Arun	Yes, I can do that  
2018-04-12 13:51:01	jesse	I'll be doing the same thing, so let me know if you find anything, and I will let you know if I find anything. If we find something good enough to scrape, then we can focus on that, but for now, lets just get links. 
2018-04-12 15:08:33	Arun	Okaaay sure, sounds good  
2018-04-16 20:35:57	jesse	Hey Arun, have you been looking into alternative medicine resources? 
2018-04-17 03:47:28	Arun	Hey sorry Jesse, I was held up with my project work for the DevOps course and I am done with that just now. I will be working on it from today (Tuesday) evening  
2018-04-17 12:49:20	jesse	sorry I thought I responded to this. That's fine. I've found a few resources if you want me to give them to ya. However, I'm just trying to think about how we can turn that into something helpful to visitors of our websites, since terminology is very different in the herbal remedy world. 
2018-04-17 12:49:43	jesse	Best resources I have seen

2018-02-16 19:33:19	Arun	And yeah, I am going through the script that you uploaded now. And I will also take a look at what Janne and Sagar has done 
2018-02-16 19:34:01	jesse	this was built off of what sagar did. I'm not sure Janne had anything worth pushing 
2018-02-16 19:37:20	jesse	the table for the pubmed rare diseases should not be counted on. it only has 1000 rows. I think we will have to create our own. 
2018-02-16 19:37:51	jesse	and they didn't even store date :disappointed: 
2018-02-16 19:41:47	Arun	Oh I see. Anyway, we do have the APIs to get the data right? For pubmed 
2018-02-16 19:42:12	jesse	thats what the Bio package at the top is. 
2018-02-16 19:42:28	Arun	Yeah right. Okay cool!  
2018-02-16 19:42:30	jesse	we basically have the data, but its kinda a blobby dictionary thats hard to get through 
2018-02-16 19:42:56	Arun	Ah, like that! Alright, got it  
2018-02-16 19:44:55	jesse	ok i got the date. I'm gonna push again if ya don't mind. 
2018-02-16 19:46:21	Arun	But anyway, if required, can we meet once on Sunday? Only if you are free  
2018-02-16 19:46:30	Arun	Awesome :grin: 
2018-02-16 19:46:38	jesse	yup. 
2018-02-16 19:47:37	jesse	ok i pushed the stuff. 
2018-02-16 19:47:41	Arun	So, I?ll go through everything and see if I?m able to understand everything that we?ve got! And Sunday I?ll ask you the questions if I have any, and we can probably sit together and get done with this part!  
2018-02-16 19:48:50	jesse	Sounds good. 
2018-02-17 21:28:14	Arun	Hey Jesse, Will you be free post lunch tomorrow? 
2018-02-18 07:54:57	jesse	yeah 
2018-02-18 11:11:16	Arun	Great, shall we meet at 4pm today then? For about 1-2 hours maximum  
2018-02-18 11:20:23	jesse	Sounds good. I've been doing quite a bit of work to this script. for the most part, I just need to let you know what my current code gathers, the errors I'm running into, what needs to be done with the outputted CSV files, and stuff like that. My thinking is after we meet at 4, I can hand the rest of the work concerning pubmed stuff to you, and I can then switch to working on the drug company data and some of the other minor tasks. 
2018-02-18 14:38:33	Arun	Sure, I?ll be in Hunt grad commons. I?ve booked room number 4314  
2018-02-18 14:39:18	jesse	can undergrads go there? 
2018-02-18 14:40:01	Arun	Ah, I totally forgot about that! But I guess you can come inside if I'm with you 
2018-02-18 14:41:52	jesse	ok. are you there now or should i wait till 4? 
2018-02-18 14:42:16	Arun	I am here in library. We can meet now, sure! But the room is available only from 4 
2018-02-18 14:42:40	Arun	So, if you can find another room, I sure can come 
2018-02-18 14:46:44	jesse	I just checked. there is no room available that I can reserve.  
2018-02-18 14:47:03	Arun	Yeah, that's what I thought too! 
2018-02-18 14:47:29	Arun	Anyway, we can still meet now if you wish 
2018-02-18 14:52:32	jesse	sure. I'm just laying in my bed anyway. give me a few minutes to finish the current csv my computer is workin on and so I can make tea /get ready to leave 
2018-02-18 14:52:56	Arun	Yeah sure, take your time! :slightly_smiling_face: 
2018-02-18 15:03:18	jesse	im at the library now 
2018-02-18 15:03:46	Arun	Oh good. Can you come to 4th floor? I'll come near the lift 
2018-02-18 18:36:25	jesse	Did you specify in LibreOffice that the CSV's were comma separated when you opened it? 
2018-02-18 18:36:50	jesse	usually it says "separate by [] comma  [] semicolon [] space... etc 
2018-02-18 18:37:18	jesse	In the big CSV, I'm getting no entries that are overflowing. 
2018-02-18 18:39:05	jesse	Same with the little csv 
2018-02-18 18:40:22	Arun	Ah really? Damn, I didn?t notice that! But yeah, the next time I open it I?ll check that too 
2018-02-18 18:44:23	jesse	I'm gonna run the entire thing once more to try to locate the XML parsing error. hopefully I'll be able to narrow it down to a place and put a try/except thing around it to just skip the document if it fails to parse. 
2018-02-18 18:44:56	jesse	If you already have that stacktrace in your terminal, could you check the line number? 
2018-02-18 18:50:04	jesse	i think i'll just put an except around the search/query part. my guess is thats where the issue is. 
2018-02-18 18:58:01	Arun	Gimme sometime, I?ll check and let you know the line number  
2018-02-18 19:27:34	Arun	My new CSV is being generated now, and I cannot check back the stacktrace 
2018-02-18 19:27:51	jesse	thats ok. I've got a CSV generating myself. 
2018-02-18 19:28:38	jesse	quick trick: if you run "tmux" you can detach the terminal so that you can close out of the terminal and do other things while the program is being run in the background. [:+1:1 :heavy_check_mark:1] 
2018-02-18 21:16:47	jesse	I got the full csv and it's beautiful 
2018-02-18 21:17:20	jesse	i mean, its what you'd expect... a csv, but I've been working quite hard just to get it lol 
2018-02-18 21:23:57	jesse	also, I don't think I pulled your changes, since you removed the fun stuff like abstract and title 
2018-02-19 18:23:21	jesse	Hey Arun, you have yurika working on your computer right? 
2018-02-19 18:23:45	jesse	Janne was wanting to use it for getting info on drug companies. 
2018-02-19 20:40:41	Arun	Hey yeah, I have it in Running! Sorry, for the late reply  
2018-02-19 20:41:27	Arun	Janne wants to use it? Sure, we can try using it. But the websites that we use should allow crawling  
2018-02-19 20:42:18	jesse	cool. I'm not sure what Janne needs. I was working with her tonight and the drug company information is chaos. I'll try to ask Janne and get her to message 
2018-02-19 20:42:19	jesse	you 
2018-02-19 20:42:35	Arun	Or I can ping Janne right away and save some time :)  
2018-02-19 20:43:08	jesse	cool! I hope it works out. 
2018-02-19 20:43:22	Arun	Alright, pinged her now!  
2018-02-19 20:44:11	jesse	Thanks dude. i tried it on my computer but i think postgresql is forever broke on my computer from trying to mess with agensgraph 
2018-02-19 20:44:58	Arun	Ah, I see! Alright, not an issue! Let?s see if we are able to get the data using Yurika  
2018-02-26 12:51:32	Arun	Hey Jesse, I just realized that I have some work for today evening. Is it alright if we push today's meeting to tomorrow? 
2018-02-26 12:58:37	jesse	i guess that depends on everyone else. i could probably meet both today and tomorrow and not run out of things to do. 
2018-02-26 12:59:04	Arun	Okay, If others are making it, I'll try to make it too! 
2018-02-26 12:59:56	jesse	ok. if not, I can just let you know what happens, whether its by text or meeting up tomorrow. 
2018-02-26 13:00:39	Arun	Alright, that's great! I'll keep you posted :slightly_smiling_face: 
2018-02-27 09:06:59	jesse	Hey Arun, I met up with Sagar last night, and Janne separately. we've got a few issues with the pubmed stuff.
2018-02-27 09:06:59		I'll give ya a quick run down:
2018-02-27 09:06:59		our pubmed data filtered everyone who were affiliated with medical schools in NC
2018-02-27 09:06:59		our specialist data filtered everyone whos hospital was in NC.
2018-02-27 09:06:59		issue 1.   many people work in NC hospitals and have their medical degrees from places outside of NC.
2018-02-27 09:06:59		but lets ignore that for now.
2018-02-27 09:06:59		issue 2. the medical schools in the pubmed data is not uniform with the specialists data for schools they came from. matching UNC Chapel Hill would be fairly easy since Chapel Hill is unique... but take North Carolina State University... filter out the unnecessary words like "north carolina" and "university" and your left with ..."state"... which doesnt help. also consider that many pubmed researchers dont seem to be affiliated with a university or school of medicine... but rather just a lab...
2018-02-27 09:06:59		Back to Issue 1. If we want to fix this, we would be looking to scrape all of the pubmed data  rather than just NC (an estimated 300hr process with extra hours for filtering duplicates.)   alternatively, we could just  not filter the specialists at all but this comes with its own risks. (still preferable but it leads us back to issue 2.)
2018-02-27 09:06:59		As for Janne, she's been working hard scraping the drug company data. sadly a good amount of her work  must be done manually. 
2018-02-27 15:29:47	Arun	Hey Jesse, just seeing your message now. Thanks for the update! 
2018-02-27 15:31:00	Arun	Regarding issue 1, we can try to write a write to check if we are getting data properly, say upto 1000 or 10000 rows. Once we are sure about the script, we can request a machine to Meaghan and we can run our script in that machine, instead of running in our personal machine 
2018-02-27 15:42:01	jesse	that sounds reasonable, but it may be better if we could just download the entire pubmed data set rather than webscraping: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/databases/download/pubmed_medline.html
2018-02-27 15:42:01		I'm not sure if this would be too much memory or not, but they also have daily update files so we wouldn't have to re-download it every time... we would just need a way to convert the xml to postgresql... [:+1:1] 
2018-02-27 15:48:34	Arun	Oh yeah, I didnt know we could download the data directly. 
2018-02-27 15:49:28	Arun	Btw, for this week I am yet to clock in and start working on specialist-disease relation 
2018-02-27 15:49:48	jesse	ya wanna task? 
2018-02-27 15:50:02	Arun	I've been busy with my stuff. I guess I will be able to work a maximum of only 8-10 hours this week and next week 
2018-02-27 15:50:53	Arun	I will try writing the script to manipulate the name according to the pubmed data and see if I can find matches 
2018-02-27 15:51:03	Arun	Once I am done with that work, I can work on other task 
2018-02-27 15:51:28	jesse	hold on with that. 
2018-02-27 15:51:46	Arun	Are you sure about it? 
2018-02-27 15:52:01	Arun	I can hold on it and work on something more important if there is any 
2018-02-27 15:54:13	jesse	part of this past meeting was that since we cannot just match first and last name, since many first names are not full names... So we wanted to link them to their universities. So if a person with the last name of Hayes went to Chapel Hill in pubmed, we could say that they are the same person who is listed in specialists as Hayes who went to Chapel Hill. Do ya follow? 
2018-02-27 15:54:49	Arun	Okay, I get it. Yeah, it makes sense 
2018-02-27 15:56:05	jesse	Also, If we download the entire pubmed thing... and somehow make it into a pubmed database, we will need to modify whatever script you were planning on writing. 
2018-02-27 15:56:28	Arun	But, Is it the only way to confirm if two persons are the same? Is there other possibilities to confirm that. I was thinking something like, if the name is Mathew Hayes and we have M Hayes, chances that they both are same is quite high, whats your thought on that? 
2018-02-27 15:58:23	jesse	we could check firstname too... but ideally we would want M Hayes from Chapel Hill === Mathew Hayes from Chapel Hill... If we are opening up all of pubmed to all of the specialists in the united states... then first and last name is no longer accurate enough.. since there are a ton of mathew hayes from the united states whereas maybe not so much with just NC. 
2018-02-27 15:58:50	Arun	Yeah agreed! 
2018-02-27 16:00:22	Arun	But since there are way too many pubmed data and too many specialists too, the computation could take more time when we start comparing different fields simulatenously, I thought. 
2018-02-27 16:00:22		But nevertheless, what you said would definitely work :slightly_smiling_face: 
2018-02-27 16:04:28	jesse	it would take more time, but it would maybe be a couple hour process just from a rough estimate i think 
2018-02-27 16:04:46	jesse	I'll still need to confirm with Kowolenko before we actually try to do this [:+1:1] 
2018-02-27 16:25:19	Arun	Yeah thats right. And Okay, so meanwhile what do you want me to work on? 
2018-02-27 16:28:18	jesse	I think you should look into trying to find a way to compare the medical school names and see if the medical school names in the specialists match with the pubmed affiliations. 
2018-02-27 16:40:26	Arun	Okay, I will look at that today and let you know when I am done with it 
2018-02-27 16:41:25	jesse	xD I wouldn't expect you to be done with it. but let me know what your thinking about that problem. Also figured we should clarify that for the specialists, we are referring to the data from http://medicare.gov (medicare.gov) rather than the other specialist data we gathered. 
2018-02-27 16:43:07	Arun	Ahh, I see. Alright. I will look into that website and see what data we've got. And yeah, I will let you know my thoughts before I actually start coding it 
2018-02-27 16:46:31	jesse	https://data.medicare.gov/Physician-Compare/Physician-Compare-National-Downloadable-File/mj5m-pzi6

[:heavy_check_mark:1 :+1:1 :slightly_smiling_face:1] 
2018-02-27 20:13:11	jesse	Hey Arun, have you been working on that problem? ^^ 
2018-02-27 20:13:48	Arun	Not yet Jesse, I was planning to look at it tonight post dinner 
2018-02-27 20:14:50	jesse	ahh I gotcha. I was just wonderin. I'm trying to decide what I wanna do, whether it's eat dinner, work on this, or go back to my apartment and play a video game :stuck_out_tongue: 
2018-02-27 20:38:51	Arun	Haha, sometime  of video game wouldn't hurt anything I believe! :smile: 
2018-02-27 21:09:54	jesse	sadly I chose to work on another project :disappointed: 
2018-02-28 13:25:40	Arun	Hey Jesse, afternoon! So, I checked out the website and also the pubmed data. What you said makes sense. 
2018-02-28 13:25:40		And once we make all the necessary calculations, we could probably try to sort the list with current NC specialist coming on the top and then in the order of nearest states wrt NC 
2018-02-28 13:26:39	Arun	But we are expected to finish all this by next thursday? 
2018-02-28 13:29:05	jesse	did you read the messages on the rarediseases channel? 
2018-02-28 13:29:16	Arun	Yes I did 
2018-02-28 13:29:29	Arun	I just checked out the messages there 
2018-02-28 13:32:14	jesse	i gotcha. yeah we are supposed to have something to show off by next thursday. I'm thinking the only truly difficult task we will have to deal with is comparing the names of the medical schools.  If we have to download all of the pubmed data, we will have a lot more troubles, which is why I'm going to try to run the script without the NC filter and see if it takes significantly more time or not. 
2018-02-28 13:34:42	Arun	Okay that would be a start. Do you want us to meet anytime this week or weekend? I fear I won't be available next week starting Monday :disappointed: 
2018-02-28 13:35:34	jesse	I'm going to charlotte starting thursday night up until next sunday... I won't be able to meet. I can do google hangouts though... but thats not as helpful 
2018-02-28 13:37:12	Arun	Ah, I see. Alright then, we will figure it out. But let's split up the work and finish it off as much as possible. 
2018-02-28 13:38:05	Arun	One question, why do you want to strip out the University names? Like, you were saying NC State University will result in 'state' which is not of any use. But, why do we have to it? 
2018-02-28 13:44:01	jesse	agreed. I'll have more information tonight... so it'll be clearer what all we need to do by the meeting time tomorrow. No matter what though, we need to find a way to compare the University names.
2018-02-28 13:44:01		As for that, the names of the affiliations in the pubmed data are not the same as the medical schools in the specialists data. We need to find a way to connect people on first/lastname (easy) and then by the university... my thought was that we could strip away some of the meaningless words so that we could match the names of the schools... but that won't work for the above reason you mentioned. Ingrams aren't too great either since swapping North Carolina State University also could match University of North Carolina State.
2018-02-28 13:44:01		Don't get too fixated on things that I say. I'm just trying to get you to understand the problem.  If you can find a way to keep all of the words in and determine that two schools are the same, all power to ya. 
2018-02-28 13:47:57	Arun	Haha, agreed. I understand you are trying to explain me the problem. :slightly_smiling_face: 
2018-02-28 13:50:23	Arun	And alright, meanwhile, let me know if you need anything! 
2018-02-28 13:50:40	jesse	Sure thing. 
2018-03-01 14:03:57	jesse	I posted the notes/todo thing I made for the week. take a look at that and then you can ask me if you have any questions. 
2018-03-01 20:16:16	Arun	Hey, I just had a look at it now. 
2018-03-01 20:19:33	Arun	I see there are immediate stuffs to get done with regard to matching physicians with pubmed data. Will you be working on any task particularly? 
2018-03-01 21:17:22	jesse	i havent decided the order Ill start tackling these things yet. sorry i didnt respond. i was driving 
2018-03-01 21:18:27	Arun	No worries! :slightly_smiling_face: And, let me know how we can go about it, if you got any leads 
2018-03-04 01:18:58	Arun	Hey, so for comparing the affiliation from pubmed and physician's medical school name, we can probably just check if medical school name is present in pubmed affiliation. 
2018-03-04 01:18:58		For example, as far as I noticed, the Physician's medical school name is pretty organised, but pubmed affiliations seem to have lot of redundant names.
2018-03-04 01:18:58		In this method, we can convert the physician's medical school name to an array and check if all the elements of the array is in pubmed affiliation. If so, we can assure that they both are the same person. 
2018-03-04 01:18:58		What do you think about this? 
2018-03-04 01:22:05	Arun	And for us to match physicians data from pubmed and physician data, the fastest method would be to put it in a DB and then querying it. 
2018-03-04 09:12:58	jesse	Hey Arun, I agree that the pubmed data is scattered and that the physician data is more organized and condensed. however, I dont think it will be enough to just check if the physician med school is in the affiliation.
2018-03-04 09:12:58		Have you taken a look at certain schools that would and would not match under this scenario? If you have, and you are comfortable with the results that gives, then sure... but im thinking we may need to worry about ngrams and abbreviations.
2018-03-04 09:12:58		Ive been trying to compile a list of all schools contained in the pubmed data and sort them, but it's been running for twelve hours and I dont think itll finish. maybe i should try a much smaller dataset.. 
2018-03-04 09:18:25	jesse	I've got a list  of the affiliations that came from diseases beginning with X-Z 
2018-03-04 09:19:24	jesse	maybe we can use that and the list of med schools from the physician data to help us determine a good matching system. 
2018-03-04 09:30:50	jesse	I also had Sagar working a lil bit on this. I gave him a list of 400 med school names that came from the physician data and had him make abbreviations for each one. (i hope he wrote a program to do this lol) 
2018-03-04 12:00:15	Arun	Right, and for matching two med school names, I can probably write a script that would take care of abbreviations too. It will be very similar to the script I wrote for comparing names in any order 
2018-03-04 12:06:22	jesse	ok. if you can, try to make it so that we arent loading the entire CSVs into the script.
2018-03-04 12:06:22		many of these files are gigabytes of text, so we will run out of memory if we do that. 
2018-03-04 12:15:54	Arun	Right, well I?m sure of how to do that part. Like, I can read from the CSV and for each line in the CSV, I will have to read from the physician?s CSV. But, in this way, for each ?row? in the pubmed, I will be reading all the rows from the physician CSV, every time. 
2018-03-04 12:15:54		Is there any other way that you know of? 
2018-03-04 12:16:11	Arun	I mean, I?m *not sure of how to do that part 
2018-03-04 12:30:35	jesse	I'm not sure either. 
2018-03-04 12:39:42	jesse	I'm gonna try to filter out the duplicates out of the pubmed data once again and see what the file size is. 
2018-03-04 12:56:03	jesse	Are you working on raredx stuff right now? 
2018-03-04 12:58:02	Arun	I'm guessing the best way to go forward would be to put it on a DB and query data. 
2018-03-04 12:58:52	Arun	Anyway, I am not working on it right now. 
2018-03-04 13:07:09	jesse	put what specifically on the db? 
2018-03-04 13:07:34	Arun	Both, the pubmed data and the physician data. Instead of having it on a CSV 
2018-03-04 13:09:25	Arun	Do you believe our searching would be faster that way? 
2018-03-04 13:15:59	jesse	I'm not sure it would matter. once pandas loads it into memory, it doesn't matter. if you were thinking of doing some sort of join statement or some python thing that worked directly with psql, then it would be faster. 
2018-03-04 15:08:59	Arun	Yeah, thats true too, alright then 
2018-03-04 20:08:59	jesse	arun, do you have a script for the medschool comparison? 
2018-03-04 21:03:00	Arun	Hey, I will send you in sometime, like half hour? I am on my way home now from outside 
2018-03-04 21:03:51	jesse	sounds good 
2018-03-04 22:23:18	Arun	Hi Jesse :slightly_smiling_face: 
2018-03-04 22:24:51	Arun	Can I send the script here? 
2018-03-04 22:27:56	Arun	@Arun uploaded a file: https://ncstateuniversityitng.slack.com/files/U95TJ10M9/F9JFZ3Z45/comparemednames.py (compareMedNames.py) and commented: Script that compares Medical School Names from pubmed data and physcian data 
2018-03-04 22:30:22	Arun	I ran this script by taking names manually form the pubmed csv and the physician data. And it worked fine for the names I used. 
2018-03-04 22:31:42	Arun	I wouldn't say this script works very fine.  There will definitely be some good amount of false positive. But since we are already comparing the names, and this is more like a second factor to affirm our decision if two persons are the same, I'm hoping this would work fine. 
2018-03-04 22:36:20	Arun	@Arun uploaded a file: https://ncstateuniversityitng.slack.com/files/U95TJ10M9/F9JBS09T6/pip_package_for_fuzzywuzzy.txt (pip package for fuzzywuzzy) and commented: Forgot to mention, you need to install the fuzzywuzzy package for this. 
2018-03-04 23:04:26	jesse	I'll take a look tomorrow. i appreciate it dude. i tried to run a script tonight but my computer froze again.... these files are just too big :( 
2018-03-05 00:21:37	Arun	Ah, I see. Yeah please run it tomorrow and let me know how it runs against our data. :slightly_smiling_face: Thanks Jesse 
2018-03-05 00:21:58	Arun	And also, do you want my script for name comparison as well? 
2018-03-05 07:13:07	jesse	yes plz. anything would help. 
2018-03-05 10:25:10	Arun	Okay, I will slightly modify whatever I?ve coded and send you in sometime. 
2018-03-05 10:25:10		I?m not working on it right now, but I?ll send you! Is that okay? 
2018-03-05 10:25:36	jesse	yeah. 
2018-03-05 10:25:40	jesse	Thanks 
2018-03-05 16:44:45	Arun	@Arun uploaded a file: https://ncstateuniversityitng.slack.com/files/U95TJ10M9/F9JBZ2HND/comparenames.py (compareNames.py) 
2018-03-06 14:54:17	Arun	Hey Jesse, I am so sorry, I have an important interview this Thursday and thus I am unable to work on it, as I have to prepare myself for the interview. I hope you understand and its alright. I will be back only by Thursday night. 
2018-03-06 14:56:03	jesse	yeah I got you. just means more money for me :stuck_out_tongue: 
2018-03-06 14:56:44	jesse	I might get Michael or meaghan to help code some of this up too. xD 
2018-03-08 18:51:24	Arun	Hi Jesse. 
2018-03-08 18:51:30	Arun	How you doing? 
2018-03-08 18:51:57	Arun	Is there anything that you want me to work on? I can work on it tomorrow 
2018-03-08 19:34:53	jesse	hey dude. ya know that list, YetAnotherMedicalSchoolList? 
2018-03-08 19:41:28	jesse	I would like the medical schools, all 404 of them  to have which state that they came from. This will be a big help with the comparisons.
2018-03-08 19:41:28		right now, I only have a program that gets the NC comparisons. this was done for the sake of efficiency... the program as it is takes 30 mins to run. with all 50 states, its gonna take 24 hours if we generate sql statements for all of them.... this is still far better than the estimated 600 days that a nested for loop would cause. 
2018-03-08 19:42:18	jesse	and I'm doing alright. i needed to run the pubmed data once more which kinda sucks. 
2018-03-09 02:45:49	Arun	YetAnotherMedicalSchoolList? I am not aware of that list 
2018-03-09 03:11:18	Arun	Oh, we have created all the databases now? 
2018-03-09 08:01:13	jesse	oh sorry i mustve spoken to sagar about that one 
2018-03-09 08:02:08	jesse	we dont have all the databases now since i got one generating right now. its the pubmed junk again. 
2018-03-09 08:03:20	jesse	YetAnotherMedicalSchoolList is something where I took all of the specialists medical schools and filtered out all the duplicates. its in the google drive 
2018-03-09 08:04:01	jesse	there were a few different lists of medical schools at this point, so thats what I decided to call it. 
2018-03-09 08:12:22	jesse	I've also got a program for checking for matches in the med schools. we need that program to match as many as possible without doing something complex like n grams... i think. if we do the ngrams, our program will take forever to run... although it may be feasible for just NC. 
2018-03-09 08:13:02	jesse	if you'd like to try to upgrade that program, feel free. 
2018-03-09 08:18:48	jesse	if you want to see those 2 programs, theyre in power6a under/home/jlsimps4/ForTheGreatAndPowerfulMichael/
2018-03-09 08:18:48		since michael was wanting to look into them.
2018-03-09 08:18:48		they require a database for the specialists and the pubmed stuff, so you can find those csvs in the ForMeaghan folder... to convert between the two, you can just use a psql \copy statement 
2018-03-09 19:23:01	Arun	Hey Jesse, I?m just checking out your messages. So comparing med schools, you have written a separate script? 
2018-03-09 19:24:02	Arun	And, you took the YetAnotherMedicalSchoolList from the already available specialist data ( that website you sent me previously) , I believe? 
2018-03-09 19:34:00	jesse	yep. the scripts are in the pubmed-crawler folder in the rarediseases repo 
2018-03-09 19:35:33	Arun	Okay I will look into it!  
2018-03-09 19:36:58	Arun	So, you want me to do which state does these universities/medical school come from eh?  
2018-03-09 19:38:46	jesse	yeah. preferably the two letter code. NC for north carolina. I asked sagar to look at the same thing so you may want to message him. And maybe put messages in the patientportalpeeps channel since I've had to repeat myself for both you and Sagar. 
2018-03-10 15:18:08	Arun	Alright I will talk to Sagar and check where he is 
2018-03-10 21:39:13	Arun	Hey. I checked with Sagar, he said he is good with doing that part. So, is there something else I could work on?  
2018-03-10 21:40:53	jesse	have you seen the script for the medschool comparisons ? 
2018-03-10 21:51:09	jesse	There are 2, getPhysicianPubmedConnection.py and compareMedSchools.py
2018-03-10 21:51:09		We are no longer deleting the duplicates from the pubmed dataset because we are keeping the disease ids with the articles... What this means is that it will take longer for the program  to run. We need to make it more efficient if possible.
2018-03-10 21:51:09		As for the second file, we need to do whatever we can to get more medical schools to match... this could be achieved by doing Ngrams or by removing more nonsense words. 
2018-03-10 21:51:09		and last of all, you can check if Janne needs help with the drug companies. I havent heard back from her.
2018-03-10 21:51:09		That is all I would know to do. There are also some issues you could look into on github. 
2018-03-10 21:55:19	jesse	Also stuff about Mesh terms when gathering the pubmed data... but I think we should hold off on that until we figure out  how to get these comparisons efficiently. [:+1:1] 
2018-03-11 14:39:29	Arun	I did check those scripts recently, but I will do go through it again today or tomorrow, to start looking into it. I will look at the compareMedSchools.py and see what we can we do it make it match better. 
2018-03-11 14:40:21	Arun	And yes, I will check with Janne too, and see if she is doing okay. 
2018-04-12 13:45:44	jesse	Hey Arun, in the meeting today, it seemed like you finished whatever you were doing, and the team wanted you to help me out with researching the Alternative Medicines. We don't really have any leads on that, just need to find out what sources are good for that and what we can scrape. 
2018-04-12 13:46:20	Arun	Hi Jesse, I was just about to ping you regarding the same  
2018-04-12 13:46:59	Arun	So, I need to look out for data on alternative medicines? 
2018-04-12 13:49:41	jesse	yep. do google searches, or whatever you can to build up a list of websites that we can scrape data from. 
2018-04-12 13:49:58	Arun	Yes, I can do that  
2018-04-12 13:51:01	jesse	I'll be doing the same thing, so let me know if you find anything, and I will let you know if I find anything. If we find something good enough to scrape, then we can focus on that, but for now, lets just get links. 
2018-04-12 15:08:33	Arun	Okaaay sure, sounds good  
2018-04-16 20:35:57	jesse	Hey Arun, have you been looking into alternative medicine resources? 
2018-04-17 03:47:28	Arun	Hey sorry Jesse, I was held up with my project work for the DevOps course and I am done with that just now. I will be working on it from today (Tuesday) evening  
2018-04-17 12:49:20	jesse	sorry I thought I responded to this. That's fine. I've found a few resources if you want me to give them to ya. However, I'm just trying to think about how we can turn that into something helpful to visitors of our websites, since terminology is very different in the herbal remedy world.

2018-02-16 19:34:01	jesse	this was built off of what sagar did. I'm not sure Janne had anything worth pushing 
2018-02-16 19:37:20	jesse	the table for the pubmed rare diseases should not be counted on. it only has 1000 rows. I think we will have to create our own. 
2018-02-16 19:37:51	jesse	and they didn't even store date :disappointed: 
2018-02-16 19:41:47	Arun	Oh I see. Anyway, we do have the APIs to get the data right? For pubmed 
2018-02-16 19:42:12	jesse	thats what the Bio package at the top is. 
2018-02-16 19:42:28	Arun	Yeah right. Okay cool!  
2018-02-16 19:42:30	jesse	we basically have the data, but its kinda a blobby dictionary thats hard to get through 
2018-02-16 19:42:56	Arun	Ah, like that! Alright, got it  
2018-02-16 19:44:55	jesse	ok i got the date. I'm gonna push again if ya don't mind. 
2018-02-16 19:46:21	Arun	But anyway, if required, can we meet once on Sunday? Only if you are free  
2018-02-16 19:46:30	Arun	Awesome :grin: 
2018-02-16 19:46:38	jesse	yup. 
2018-02-16 19:47:37	jesse	ok i pushed the stuff. 
2018-02-16 19:47:41	Arun	So, I?ll go through everything and see if I?m able to understand everything that we?ve got! And Sunday I?ll ask you the questions if I have any, and we can probably sit together and get done with this part!  
2018-02-16 19:48:50	jesse	Sounds good. 
2018-02-17 21:28:14	Arun	Hey Jesse, Will you be free post lunch tomorrow? 
2018-02-18 07:54:57	jesse	yeah 
2018-02-18 11:11:16	Arun	Great, shall we meet at 4pm today then? For about 1-2 hours maximum  
2018-02-18 11:20:23	jesse	Sounds good. I've been doing quite a bit of work to this script. for the most part, I just need to let you know what my current code gathers, the errors I'm running into, what needs to be done with the outputted CSV files, and stuff like that. My thinking is after we meet at 4, I can hand the rest of the work concerning pubmed stuff to you, and I can then switch to working on the drug company data and some of the other minor tasks. 
2018-02-18 14:38:33	Arun	Sure, I?ll be in Hunt grad commons. I?ve booked room number 4314  
2018-02-18 14:39:18	jesse	can undergrads go there? 
2018-02-18 14:40:01	Arun	Ah, I totally forgot about that! But I guess you can come inside if I'm with you 
2018-02-18 14:41:52	jesse	ok. are you there now or should i wait till 4? 
2018-02-18 14:42:16	Arun	I am here in library. We can meet now, sure! But the room is available only from 4 
2018-02-18 14:42:40	Arun	So, if you can find another room, I sure can come 
2018-02-18 14:46:44	jesse	I just checked. there is no room available that I can reserve.  
2018-02-18 14:47:03	Arun	Yeah, that's what I thought too! 
2018-02-18 14:47:29	Arun	Anyway, we can still meet now if you wish 
2018-02-18 14:52:32	jesse	sure. I'm just laying in my bed anyway. give me a few minutes to finish the current csv my computer is workin on and so I can make tea /get ready to leave 
2018-02-18 14:52:56	Arun	Yeah sure, take your time! :slightly_smiling_face: 
2018-02-18 15:03:18	jesse	im at the library now 
2018-02-18 15:03:46	Arun	Oh good. Can you come to 4th floor? I'll come near the lift 
2018-02-18 18:36:25	jesse	Did you specify in LibreOffice that the CSV's were comma separated when you opened it? 
2018-02-18 18:36:50	jesse	usually it says "separate by [] comma  [] semicolon [] space... etc 
2018-02-18 18:37:18	jesse	In the big CSV, I'm getting no entries that are overflowing. 
2018-02-18 18:39:05	jesse	Same with the little csv 
2018-02-18 18:40:22	Arun	Ah really? Damn, I didn?t notice that! But yeah, the next time I open it I?ll check that too 
2018-02-18 18:44:23	jesse	I'm gonna run the entire thing once more to try to locate the XML parsing error. hopefully I'll be able to narrow it down to a place and put a try/except thing around it to just skip the document if it fails to parse. 
2018-02-18 18:44:56	jesse	If you already have that stacktrace in your terminal, could you check the line number? 
2018-02-18 18:50:04	jesse	i think i'll just put an except around the search/query part. my guess is thats where the issue is. 
2018-02-18 18:58:01	Arun	Gimme sometime, I?ll check and let you know the line number  
2018-02-18 19:27:34	Arun	My new CSV is being generated now, and I cannot check back the stacktrace 
2018-02-18 19:27:51	jesse	thats ok. I've got a CSV generating myself. 
2018-02-18 19:28:38	jesse	quick trick: if you run "tmux" you can detach the terminal so that you can close out of the terminal and do other things while the program is being run in the background. [:+1:1 :heavy_check_mark:1] 
2018-02-18 21:16:47	jesse	I got the full csv and it's beautiful 
2018-02-18 21:17:20	jesse	i mean, its what you'd expect... a csv, but I've been working quite hard just to get it lol 
2018-02-18 21:23:57	jesse	also, I don't think I pulled your changes, since you removed the fun stuff like abstract and title 
2018-02-19 18:23:21	jesse	Hey Arun, you have yurika working on your computer right? 
2018-02-19 18:23:45	jesse	Janne was wanting to use it for getting info on drug companies. 
2018-02-19 20:40:41	Arun	Hey yeah, I have it in Running! Sorry, for the late reply  
2018-02-19 20:41:27	Arun	Janne wants to use it? Sure, we can try using it. But the websites that we use should allow crawling  
2018-02-19 20:42:18	jesse	cool. I'm not sure what Janne needs. I was working with her tonight and the drug company information is chaos. I'll try to ask Janne and get her to message 
2018-02-19 20:42:19	jesse	you 
2018-02-19 20:42:35	Arun	Or I can ping Janne right away and save some time :)  
2018-02-19 20:43:08	jesse	cool! I hope it works out. 
2018-02-19 20:43:22	Arun	Alright, pinged her now!  
2018-02-19 20:44:11	jesse	Thanks dude. i tried it on my computer but i think postgresql is forever broke on my computer from trying to mess with agensgraph 
2018-02-19 20:44:58	Arun	Ah, I see! Alright, not an issue! Let?s see if we are able to get the data using Yurika  
2018-02-26 12:51:32	Arun	Hey Jesse, I just realized that I have some work for today evening. Is it alright if we push today's meeting to tomorrow? 
2018-02-26 12:58:37	jesse	i guess that depends on everyone else. i could probably meet both today and tomorrow and not run out of things to do. 
2018-02-26 12:59:04	Arun	Okay, If others are making it, I'll try to make it too! 
2018-02-26 12:59:56	jesse	ok. if not, I can just let you know what happens, whether its by text or meeting up tomorrow. 
2018-02-26 13:00:39	Arun	Alright, that's great! I'll keep you posted :slightly_smiling_face: 
2018-02-27 09:06:59	jesse	Hey Arun, I met up with Sagar last night, and Janne separately. we've got a few issues with the pubmed stuff.
2018-02-27 09:06:59		I'll give ya a quick run down:
2018-02-27 09:06:59		our pubmed data filtered everyone who were affiliated with medical schools in NC
2018-02-27 09:06:59		our specialist data filtered everyone whos hospital was in NC.
2018-02-27 09:06:59		issue 1.   many people work in NC hospitals and have their medical degrees from places outside of NC.
2018-02-27 09:06:59		but lets ignore that for now.
2018-02-27 09:06:59		issue 2. the medical schools in the pubmed data is not uniform with the specialists data for schools they came from. matching UNC Chapel Hill would be fairly easy since Chapel Hill is unique... but take North Carolina State University... filter out the unnecessary words like "north carolina" and "university" and your left with ..."state"... which doesnt help. also consider that many pubmed researchers dont seem to be affiliated with a university or school of medicine... but rather just a lab...
2018-02-27 09:06:59		Back to Issue 1. If we want to fix this, we would be looking to scrape all of the pubmed data  rather than just NC (an estimated 300hr process with extra hours for filtering duplicates.)   alternatively, we could just  not filter the specialists at all but this comes with its own risks. (still preferable but it leads us back to issue 2.)
2018-02-27 09:06:59		As for Janne, she's been working hard scraping the drug company data. sadly a good amount of her work  must be done manually. 
2018-02-27 15:29:47	Arun	Hey Jesse, just seeing your message now. Thanks for the update! 
2018-02-27 15:31:00	Arun	Regarding issue 1, we can try to write a write to check if we are getting data properly, say upto 1000 or 10000 rows. Once we are sure about the script, we can request a machine to Meaghan and we can run our script in that machine, instead of running in our personal machine 
2018-02-27 15:42:01	jesse	that sounds reasonable, but it may be better if we could just download the entire pubmed data set rather than webscraping: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/databases/download/pubmed_medline.html
2018-02-27 15:42:01		I'm not sure if this would be too much memory or not, but they also have daily update files so we wouldn't have to re-download it every time... we would just need a way to convert the xml to postgresql... [:+1:1] 
2018-02-27 15:48:34	Arun	Oh yeah, I didnt know we could download the data directly. 
2018-02-27 15:49:28	Arun	Btw, for this week I am yet to clock in and start working on specialist-disease relation 
2018-02-27 15:49:48	jesse	ya wanna task? 
2018-02-27 15:50:02	Arun	I've been busy with my stuff. I guess I will be able to work a maximum of only 8-10 hours this week and next week 
2018-02-27 15:50:53	Arun	I will try writing the script to manipulate the name according to the pubmed data and see if I can find matches 
2018-02-27 15:51:03	Arun	Once I am done with that work, I can work on other task 
2018-02-27 15:51:28	jesse	hold on with that. 
2018-02-27 15:51:46	Arun	Are you sure about it? 
2018-02-27 15:52:01	Arun	I can hold on it and work on something more important if there is any 
2018-02-27 15:54:13	jesse	part of this past meeting was that since we cannot just match first and last name, since many first names are not full names... So we wanted to link them to their universities. So if a person with the last name of Hayes went to Chapel Hill in pubmed, we could say that they are the same person who is listed in specialists as Hayes who went to Chapel Hill. Do ya follow? 
2018-02-27 15:54:49	Arun	Okay, I get it. Yeah, it makes sense 
2018-02-27 15:56:05	jesse	Also, If we download the entire pubmed thing... and somehow make it into a pubmed database, we will need to modify whatever script you were planning on writing. 
2018-02-27 15:56:28	Arun	But, Is it the only way to confirm if two persons are the same? Is there other possibilities to confirm that. I was thinking something like, if the name is Mathew Hayes and we have M Hayes, chances that they both are same is quite high, whats your thought on that? 
2018-02-27 15:58:23	jesse	we could check firstname too... but ideally we would want M Hayes from Chapel Hill === Mathew Hayes from Chapel Hill... If we are opening up all of pubmed to all of the specialists in the united states... then first and last name is no longer accurate enough.. since there are a ton of mathew hayes from the united states whereas maybe not so much with just NC. 
2018-02-27 15:58:50	Arun	Yeah agreed! 
2018-02-27 16:00:22	Arun	But since there are way too many pubmed data and too many specialists too, the computation could take more time when we start comparing different fields simulatenously, I thought. 
2018-02-27 16:00:22		But nevertheless, what you said would definitely work :slightly_smiling_face: 
2018-02-27 16:04:28	jesse	it would take more time, but it would maybe be a couple hour process just from a rough estimate i think 
2018-02-27 16:04:46	jesse	I'll still need to confirm with Kowolenko before we actually try to do this [:+1:1] 
2018-02-27 16:25:19	Arun	Yeah thats right. And Okay, so meanwhile what do you want me to work on? 
2018-02-27 16:28:18	jesse	I think you should look into trying to find a way to compare the medical school names and see if the medical school names in the specialists match with the pubmed affiliations. 
2018-02-27 16:40:26	Arun	Okay, I will look at that today and let you know when I am done with it 
2018-02-27 16:41:25	jesse	xD I wouldn't expect you to be done with it. but let me know what your thinking about that problem. Also figured we should clarify that for the specialists, we are referring to the data from http://medicare.gov (medicare.gov) rather than the other specialist data we gathered. 
2018-02-27 16:43:07	Arun	Ahh, I see. Alright. I will look into that website and see what data we've got. And yeah, I will let you know my thoughts before I actually start coding it 
2018-02-27 16:46:31	jesse	https://data.medicare.gov/Physician-Compare/Physician-Compare-National-Downloadable-File/mj5m-pzi6
2018-02-27 16:46:31		Physician Compare National Downloadable File | Data.Medicare.gov
2018-02-27 16:46:31		Physician Compare National Downloadable File - The Physician Compare National Downloadable File is organized at the individual eligible professional level; each line is unique at the professional/enrollment record/Group Practice/address level. Professionals with multiple Medicare enrollment records and/or single enrollments linking to multiple practice location addresses are listed on multiple lines. [:heavy_check_mark:1 :+1:1 :slightly_smiling_face:1] 
2018-02-27 20:13:11	jesse	Hey Arun, have you been working on that problem? ^^ 
2018-02-27 20:13:48	Arun	Not yet Jesse, I was planning to look at it tonight post dinner 
2018-02-27 20:14:50	jesse	ahh I gotcha. I was just wonderin. I'm trying to decide what I wanna do, whether it's eat dinner, work on this, or go back to my apartment and play a video game :stuck_out_tongue: 
2018-02-27 20:38:51	Arun	Haha, sometime  of video game wouldn't hurt anything I believe! :smile: 
2018-02-27 21:09:54	jesse	sadly I chose to work on another project :disappointed: 
2018-02-28 13:25:40	Arun	Hey Jesse, afternoon! So, I checked out the website and also the pubmed data. What you said makes sense. 
2018-02-28 13:25:40		And once we make all the necessary calculations, we could probably try to sort the list with current NC specialist coming on the top and then in the order of nearest states wrt NC 
2018-02-28 13:26:39	Arun	But we are expected to finish all this by next thursday? 
2018-02-28 13:29:05	jesse	did you read the messages on the rarediseases channel? 
2018-02-28 13:29:16	Arun	Yes I did 
2018-02-28 13:29:29	Arun	I just checked out the messages there 
2018-02-28 13:32:14	jesse	i gotcha. yeah we are supposed to have something to show off by next thursday. I'm thinking the only truly difficult task we will have to deal with is comparing the names of the medical schools.  If we have to download all of the pubmed data, we will have a lot more troubles, which is why I'm going to try to run the script without the NC filter and see if it takes significantly more time or not. 
2018-02-28 13:34:42	Arun	Okay that would be a start. Do you want us to meet anytime this week or weekend? I fear I won't be available next week starting Monday :disappointed: 
2018-02-28 13:35:34	jesse	I'm going to charlotte starting thursday night up until next sunday... I won't be able to meet. I can do google hangouts though... but thats not as helpful 
2018-02-28 13:37:12	Arun	Ah, I see. Alright then, we will figure it out. But let's split up the work and finish it off as much as possible. 
2018-02-28 13:38:05	Arun	One question, why do you want to strip out the University names? Like, you were saying NC State University will result in 'state' which is not of any use. But, why do we have to it? 
2018-02-28 13:44:01	jesse	agreed. I'll have more information tonight... so it'll be clearer what all we need to do by the meeting time tomorrow. No matter what though, we need to find a way to compare the University names.
2018-02-28 13:44:01		As for that, the names of the affiliations in the pubmed data are not the same as the medical schools in the specialists data. We need to find a way to connect people on first/lastname (easy) and then by the university... my thought was that we could strip away some of the meaningless words so that we could match the names of the schools... but that won't work for the above reason you mentioned. Ingrams aren't too great either since swapping North Carolina State University also could match University of North Carolina State.
2018-02-28 13:44:01		Don't get too fixated on things that I say. I'm just trying to get you to understand the problem.  If you can find a way to keep all of the words in and determine that two schools are the same, all power to ya. 
2018-02-28 13:47:57	Arun	Haha, agreed. I understand you are trying to explain me the problem. :slightly_smiling_face: 
2018-02-28 13:50:23	Arun	And alright, meanwhile, let me know if you need anything! 
2018-02-28 13:50:40	jesse	Sure thing. 
2018-03-01 14:03:57	jesse	I posted the notes/todo thing I made for the week. take a look at that and then you can ask me if you have any questions. 
2018-03-01 20:16:16	Arun	Hey, I just had a look at it now. 
2018-03-01 20:19:33	Arun	I see there are immediate stuffs to get done with regard to matching physicians with pubmed data. Will you be working on any task particularly? 
2018-03-01 21:17:22	jesse	i havent decided the order Ill start tackling these things yet. sorry i didnt respond. i was driving 
2018-03-01 21:18:27	Arun	No worries! :slightly_smiling_face: And, let me know how we can go about it, if you got any leads 
2018-03-04 01:18:58	Arun	Hey, so for comparing the affiliation from pubmed and physician's medical school name, we can probably just check if medical school name is present in pubmed affiliation. 
2018-03-04 01:18:58		For example, as far as I noticed, the Physician's medical school name is pretty organised, but pubmed affiliations seem to have lot of redundant names.
2018-03-04 01:18:58		In this method, we can convert the physician's medical school name to an array and check if all the elements of the array is in pubmed affiliation. If so, we can assure that they both are the same person. 
2018-03-04 01:18:58		What do you think about this? 
2018-03-04 01:22:05	Arun	And for us to match physicians data from pubmed and physician data, the fastest method would be to put it in a DB and then querying it. 
2018-03-04 09:12:58	jesse	Hey Arun, I agree that the pubmed data is scattered and that the physician data is more organized and condensed. however, I dont think it will be enough to just check if the physician med school is in the affiliation.
2018-03-04 09:12:58		Have you taken a look at certain schools that would and would not match under this scenario? If you have, and you are comfortable with the results that gives, then sure... but im thinking we may need to worry about ngrams and abbreviations.
2018-03-04 09:12:58		Ive been trying to compile a list of all schools contained in the pubmed data and sort them, but it's been running for twelve hours and I dont think itll finish. maybe i should try a much smaller dataset.. 
2018-03-04 09:18:25	jesse	I've got a list  of the affiliations that came from diseases beginning with X-Z 
2018-03-04 09:19:24	jesse	maybe we can use that and the list of med schools from the physician data to help us determine a good matching system. 
2018-03-04 09:30:50	jesse	I also had Sagar working a lil bit on this. I gave him a list of 400 med school names that came from the physician data and had him make abbreviations for each one. (i hope he wrote a program to do this lol) 
2018-03-04 12:00:15	Arun	Right, and for matching two med school names, I can probably write a script that would take care of abbreviations too. It will be very similar to the script I wrote for comparing names in any order 
2018-03-04 12:06:22	jesse	ok. if you can, try to make it so that we arent loading the entire CSVs into the script.
2018-03-04 12:06:22		many of these files are gigabytes of text, so we will run out of memory if we do that. 
2018-03-04 12:15:54	Arun	Right, well I?m sure of how to do that part. Like, I can read from the CSV and for each line in the CSV, I will have to read from the physician?s CSV. But, in this way, for each ?row? in the pubmed, I will be reading all the rows from the physician CSV, every time. 
2018-03-04 12:15:54		Is there any other way that you know of? 
2018-03-04 12:16:11	Arun	I mean, I?m *not sure of how to do that part 
2018-03-04 12:30:35	jesse	I'm not sure either. 
2018-03-04 12:39:42	jesse	I'm gonna try to filter out the duplicates out of the pubmed data once again and see what the file size is. 
2018-03-04 12:56:03	jesse	Are you working on raredx stuff right now? 
2018-03-04 12:58:02	Arun	I'm guessing the best way to go forward would be to put it on a DB and query data. 
2018-03-04 12:58:52	Arun	Anyway, I am not working on it right now. 
2018-03-04 13:07:09	jesse	put what specifically on the db? 
2018-03-04 13:07:34	Arun	Both, the pubmed data and the physician data. Instead of having it on a CSV 
2018-03-04 13:09:25	Arun	Do you believe our searching would be faster that way? 
2018-03-04 13:15:59	jesse	I'm not sure it would matter. once pandas loads it into memory, it doesn't matter. if you were thinking of doing some sort of join statement or some python thing that worked directly with psql, then it would be faster. 
2018-03-04 15:08:59	Arun	Yeah, thats true too, alright then 
2018-03-04 20:08:59	jesse	arun, do you have a script for the medschool comparison? 
2018-03-04 21:03:00	Arun	Hey, I will send you in sometime, like half hour? I am on my way home now from outside 
2018-03-04 21:03:51	jesse	sounds good 
2018-03-04 22:23:18	Arun	Hi Jesse :slightly_smiling_face: 
2018-03-04 22:24:51	Arun	Can I send the script here? 
2018-03-04 22:27:56	Arun	@Arun uploaded a file: https://ncstateuniversityitng.slack.com/files/U95TJ10M9/F9JFZ3Z45/comparemednames.py (compareMedNames.py) and commented: Script that compares Medical School Names from pubmed data and physcian data 
2018-03-04 22:30:22	Arun	I ran this script by taking names manually form the pubmed csv and the physician data. And it worked fine for the names I used. 
2018-03-04 22:31:42	Arun	I wouldn't say this script works very fine.  There will definitely be some good amount of false positive. But since we are already comparing the names, and this is more like a second factor to affirm our decision if two persons are the same, I'm hoping this would work fine. 
2018-03-04 22:36:20	Arun	@Arun uploaded a file: https://ncstateuniversityitng.slack.com/files/U95TJ10M9/F9JBS09T6/pip_package_for_fuzzywuzzy.txt (pip package for fuzzywuzzy) and commented: Forgot to mention, you need to install the fuzzywuzzy package for this. 
2018-03-04 23:04:26	jesse	I'll take a look tomorrow. i appreciate it dude. i tried to run a script tonight but my computer froze again.... these files are just too big :( 
2018-03-05 00:21:37	Arun	Ah, I see. Yeah please run it tomorrow and let me know how it runs against our data. :slightly_smiling_face: Thanks Jesse 
2018-03-05 00:21:58	Arun	And also, do you want my script for name comparison as well? 
2018-03-05 07:13:07	jesse	yes plz. anything would help. 
2018-03-05 10:25:10	Arun	Okay, I will slightly modify whatever I?ve coded and send you in sometime. 
2018-03-05 10:25:10		I?m not working on it right now, but I?ll send you! Is that okay? 
2018-03-05 10:25:36	jesse	yeah. 
2018-03-05 10:25:40	jesse	Thanks 
2018-03-05 16:44:45	Arun	@Arun uploaded a file: https://ncstateuniversityitng.slack.com/files/U95TJ10M9/F9JBZ2HND/comparenames.py (compareNames.py) 
2018-03-06 14:54:17	Arun	Hey Jesse, I am so sorry, I have an important interview this Thursday and thus I am unable to work on it, as I have to prepare myself for the interview. I hope you understand and its alright. I will be back only by Thursday night. 
2018-03-06 14:56:03	jesse	yeah I got you. just means more money for me :stuck_out_tongue: 
2018-03-06 14:56:44	jesse	I might get Michael or meaghan to help code some of this up too. xD 
2018-03-08 18:51:24	Arun	Hi Jesse. 
2018-03-08 18:51:30	Arun	How you doing? 
2018-03-08 18:51:57	Arun	Is there anything that you want me to work on? I can work on it tomorrow 
2018-03-08 19:34:53	jesse	hey dude. ya know that list, YetAnotherMedicalSchoolList? 
2018-03-08 19:41:28	jesse	I would like the medical schools, all 404 of them  to have which state that they came from. This will be a big help with the comparisons.
2018-03-08 19:41:28		right now, I only have a program that gets the NC comparisons. this was done for the sake of efficiency... the program as it is takes 30 mins to run. with all 50 states, its gonna take 24 hours if we generate sql statements for all of them.... this is still far better than the estimated 600 days that a nested for loop would cause. 
2018-03-08 19:42:18	jesse	and I'm doing alright. i needed to run the pubmed data once more which kinda sucks. 
2018-03-09 02:45:49	Arun	YetAnotherMedicalSchoolList? I am not aware of that list 
2018-03-09 03:11:18	Arun	Oh, we have created all the databases now? 
2018-03-09 08:01:13	jesse	oh sorry i mustve spoken to sagar about that one 
2018-03-09 08:02:08	jesse	we dont have all the databases now since i got one generating right now. its the pubmed junk again. 
2018-03-09 08:03:20	jesse	YetAnotherMedicalSchoolList is something where I took all of the specialists medical schools and filtered out all the duplicates. its in the google drive 
2018-03-09 08:04:01	jesse	there were a few different lists of medical schools at this point, so thats what I decided to call it. 
2018-03-09 08:12:22	jesse	I've also got a program for checking for matches in the med schools. we need that program to match as many as possible without doing something complex like n grams... i think. if we do the ngrams, our program will take forever to run... although it may be feasible for just NC. 
2018-03-09 08:13:02	jesse	if you'd like to try to upgrade that program, feel free. 
2018-03-09 08:18:48	jesse	if you want to see those 2 programs, theyre in power6a under/home/jlsimps4/ForTheGreatAndPowerfulMichael/
2018-03-09 08:18:48		since michael was wanting to look into them.
2018-03-09 08:18:48		they require a database for the specialists and the pubmed stuff, so you can find those csvs in the ForMeaghan folder... to convert between the two, you can just use a psql \copy statement 
2018-03-09 19:23:01	Arun	Hey Jesse, I?m just checking out your messages. So comparing med schools, you have written a separate script? 
2018-03-09 19:24:02	Arun	And, you took the YetAnotherMedicalSchoolList from the already available specialist data ( that website you sent me previously) , I believe? 
2018-03-09 19:34:00	jesse	yep. the scripts are in the pubmed-crawler folder in the rarediseases repo 
2018-03-09 19:35:33	Arun	Okay I will look into it!  
2018-03-09 19:36:58	Arun	So, you want me to do which state does these universities/medical school come from eh?  
2018-03-09 19:38:46	jesse	yeah. preferably the two letter code. NC for north carolina. I asked sagar to look at the same thing so you may want to message him. And maybe put messages in the patientportalpeeps channel since I've had to repeat myself for both you and Sagar. 
2018-03-10 15:18:08	Arun	Alright I will talk to Sagar and check where he is 
2018-03-10 21:39:13	Arun	Hey. I checked with Sagar, he said he is good with doing that part. So, is there something else I could work on?  
2018-03-10 21:40:53	jesse	have you seen the script for the medschool comparisons ? 
2018-03-10 21:51:09	jesse	There are 2, getPhysicianPubmedConnection.py and compareMedSchools.py
2018-03-10 21:51:09		We are no longer deleting the duplicates from the pubmed dataset because we are keeping the disease ids with the articles... What this means is that it will take longer for the program  to run. We need to make it more efficient if possible.
2018-03-10 21:51:09		As for the second file, we need to do whatever we can to get more medical schools to match... this could be achieved by doing Ngrams or by removing more nonsense words. 
2018-03-10 21:51:09		and last of all, you can check if Janne needs help with the drug companies. I havent heard back from her.
2018-03-10 21:51:09		That is all I would know to do. There are also some issues you could look into on github. 
2018-03-10 21:55:19	jesse	Also stuff about Mesh terms when gathering the pubmed data... but I think we should hold off on that until we figure out  how to get these comparisons efficiently. [:+1:1] 
2018-03-11 14:39:29	Arun	I did check those scripts recently, but I will do go through it again today or tomorrow, to start looking into it. I will look at the compareMedSchools.py and see what we can we do it make it match better. 
2018-03-11 14:40:21	Arun	And yes, I will check with Janne too, and see if she is doing okay. 
2018-04-12 13:45:44	jesse	Hey Arun, in the meeting today, it seemed like you finished whatever you were doing, and the team wanted you to help me out with researching the Alternative Medicines. We don't really have any leads on that, just need to find out what sources are good for that and what we can scrape. 
2018-04-12 13:46:20	Arun	Hi Jesse, I was just about to ping you regarding the same  
2018-04-12 13:46:59	Arun	So, I need to look out for data on alternative medicines? 
2018-04-12 13:49:41	jesse	yep. do google searches, or whatever you can to build up a list of websites that we can scrape data from. 
2018-04-12 13:49:58	Arun	Yes, I can do that  
2018-04-12 13:51:01	jesse	I'll be doing the same thing, so let me know if you find anything, and I will let you know if I find anything. If we find something good enough to scrape, then we can focus on that, but for now, lets just get links. 
2018-04-12 15:08:33	Arun	Okaaay sure, sounds good  
2018-04-16 20:35:57	jesse	Hey Arun, have you been looking into alternative medicine resources? 
2018-04-17 03:47:28	Arun	Hey sorry Jesse, I was held up with my project work for the DevOps course and I am done with that just now. I will be working on it from today (Tuesday) evening  
2018-04-17 12:49:20	jesse	sorry I thought I responded to this. That's fine. I've found a few resources if you want me to give them to ya. However, I'm just trying to think about how we can turn that into something helpful to visitors of our websites, since terminology is very different in the herbal remedy world. 
2018-04-17 12:49:43	jesse	Best resources I have seen

2018-02-16 19:33:19	Arun	And yeah, I am going through the script that you uploaded now. And I will also take a look at what Janne and Sagar has done 
2018-02-16 19:34:01	jesse	this was built off of what sagar did. I'm not sure Janne had anything worth pushing 
2018-02-16 19:37:20	jesse	the table for the pubmed rare diseases should not be counted on. it only has 1000 rows. I think we will have to create our own. 
2018-02-16 19:37:51	jesse	and they didn't even store date :disappointed: 
2018-02-16 19:41:47	Arun	Oh I see. Anyway, we do have the APIs to get the data right? For pubmed 
2018-02-16 19:42:12	jesse	thats what the Bio package at the top is. 
2018-02-16 19:42:28	Arun	Yeah right. Okay cool!  
2018-02-16 19:42:30	jesse	we basically have the data, but its kinda a blobby dictionary thats hard to get through 
2018-02-16 19:42:56	Arun	Ah, like that! Alright, got it  
2018-02-16 19:44:55	jesse	ok i got the date. I'm gonna push again if ya don't mind. 
2018-02-16 19:46:21	Arun	But anyway, if required, can we meet once on Sunday? Only if you are free  
2018-02-16 19:46:30	Arun	Awesome :grin: 
2018-02-16 19:46:38	jesse	yup. 
2018-02-16 19:47:37	jesse	ok i pushed the stuff. 
2018-02-16 19:47:41	Arun	So, I?ll go through everything and see if I?m able to understand everything that we?ve got! And Sunday I?ll ask you the questions if I have any, and we can probably sit together and get done with this part!  
2018-02-16 19:48:50	jesse	Sounds good. 
2018-02-17 21:28:14	Arun	Hey Jesse, Will you be free post lunch tomorrow? 
2018-02-18 07:54:57	jesse	yeah 
2018-02-18 11:11:16	Arun	Great, shall we meet at 4pm today then? For about 1-2 hours maximum  
2018-02-18 11:20:23	jesse	Sounds good. I've been doing quite a bit of work to this script. for the most part, I just need to let you know what my current code gathers, the errors I'm running into, what needs to be done with the outputted CSV files, and stuff like that. My thinking is after we meet at 4, I can hand the rest of the work concerning pubmed stuff to you, and I can then switch to working on the drug company data and some of the other minor tasks. 
2018-02-18 14:38:33	Arun	Sure, I?ll be in Hunt grad commons. I?ve booked room number 4314  
2018-02-18 14:39:18	jesse	can undergrads go there? 
2018-02-18 14:40:01	Arun	Ah, I totally forgot about that! But I guess you can come inside if I'm with you 
2018-02-18 14:41:52	jesse	ok. are you there now or should i wait till 4? 
2018-02-18 14:42:16	Arun	I am here in library. We can meet now, sure! But the room is available only from 4 
2018-02-18 14:42:40	Arun	So, if you can find another room, I sure can come 
2018-02-18 14:46:44	jesse	I just checked. there is no room available that I can reserve.  
2018-02-18 14:47:03	Arun	Yeah, that's what I thought too! 
2018-02-18 14:47:29	Arun	Anyway, we can still meet now if you wish 
2018-02-18 14:52:32	jesse	sure. I'm just laying in my bed anyway. give me a few minutes to finish the current csv my computer is workin on and so I can make tea /get ready to leave 
2018-02-18 14:52:56	Arun	Yeah sure, take your time! :slightly_smiling_face: 
2018-02-18 15:03:18	jesse	im at the library now 
2018-02-18 15:03:46	Arun	Oh good. Can you come to 4th floor? I'll come near the lift 
2018-02-18 18:36:25	jesse	Did you specify in LibreOffice that the CSV's were comma separated when you opened it? 
2018-02-18 18:36:50	jesse	usually it says "separate by [] comma  [] semicolon [] space... etc 
2018-02-18 18:37:18	jesse	In the big CSV, I'm getting no entries that are overflowing. 
2018-02-18 18:39:05	jesse	Same with the little csv 
2018-02-18 18:40:22	Arun	Ah really? Damn, I didn?t notice that! But yeah, the next time I open it I?ll check that too 
2018-02-18 18:44:23	jesse	I'm gonna run the entire thing once more to try to locate the XML parsing error. hopefully I'll be able to narrow it down to a place and put a try/except thing around it to just skip the document if it fails to parse. 
2018-02-18 18:44:56	jesse	If you already have that stacktrace in your terminal, could you check the line number? 
2018-02-18 18:50:04	jesse	i think i'll just put an except around the search/query part. my guess is thats where the issue is. 
2018-02-18 18:58:01	Arun	Gimme sometime, I?ll check and let you know the line number  
2018-02-18 19:27:34	Arun	My new CSV is being generated now, and I cannot check back the stacktrace 
2018-02-18 19:27:51	jesse	thats ok. I've got a CSV generating myself. 
2018-02-18 19:28:38	jesse	quick trick: if you run "tmux" you can detach the terminal so that you can close out of the terminal and do other things while the program is being run in the background. [:+1:1 :heavy_check_mark:1] 
2018-02-18 21:16:47	jesse	I got the full csv and it's beautiful 
2018-02-18 21:17:20	jesse	i mean, its what you'd expect... a csv, but I've been working quite hard just to get it lol 
2018-02-18 21:23:57	jesse	also, I don't think I pulled your changes, since you removed the fun stuff like abstract and title 
2018-02-19 18:23:21	jesse	Hey Arun, you have yurika working on your computer right? 
2018-02-19 18:23:45	jesse	Janne was wanting to use it for getting info on drug companies. 
2018-02-19 20:40:41	Arun	Hey yeah, I have it in Running! Sorry, for the late reply  
2018-02-19 20:41:27	Arun	Janne wants to use it? Sure, we can try using it. But the websites that we use should allow crawling  
2018-02-19 20:42:18	jesse	cool. I'm not sure what Janne needs. I was working with her tonight and the drug company information is chaos. I'll try to ask Janne and get her to message 
2018-02-19 20:42:19	jesse	you 
2018-02-19 20:42:35	Arun	Or I can ping Janne right away and save some time :)  
2018-02-19 20:43:08	jesse	cool! I hope it works out. 
2018-02-19 20:43:22	Arun	Alright, pinged her now!  
2018-02-19 20:44:11	jesse	Thanks dude. i tried it on my computer but i think postgresql is forever broke on my computer from trying to mess with agensgraph 
2018-02-19 20:44:58	Arun	Ah, I see! Alright, not an issue! Let?s see if we are able to get the data using Yurika  
2018-02-26 12:51:32	Arun	Hey Jesse, I just realized that I have some work for today evening. Is it alright if we push today's meeting to tomorrow? 
2018-02-26 12:58:37	jesse	i guess that depends on everyone else. i could probably meet both today and tomorrow and not run out of things to do. 
2018-02-26 12:59:04	Arun	Okay, If others are making it, I'll try to make it too! 
2018-02-26 12:59:56	jesse	ok. if not, I can just let you know what happens, whether its by text or meeting up tomorrow. 
2018-02-26 13:00:39	Arun	Alright, that's great! I'll keep you posted :slightly_smiling_face: 
2018-02-27 09:06:59	jesse	Hey Arun, I met up with Sagar last night, and Janne separately. we've got a few issues with the pubmed stuff.
2018-02-27 09:06:59		I'll give ya a quick run down:
2018-02-27 09:06:59		our pubmed data filtered everyone who were affiliated with medical schools in NC
2018-02-27 09:06:59		our specialist data filtered everyone whos hospital was in NC.
2018-02-27 09:06:59		issue 1.   many people work in NC hospitals and have their medical degrees from places outside of NC.
2018-02-27 09:06:59		but lets ignore that for now.
2018-02-27 09:06:59		issue 2. the medical schools in the pubmed data is not uniform with the specialists data for schools they came from. matching UNC Chapel Hill would be fairly easy since Chapel Hill is unique... but take North Carolina State University... filter out the unnecessary words like "north carolina" and "university" and your left with ..."state"... which doesnt help. also consider that many pubmed researchers dont seem to be affiliated with a university or school of medicine... but rather just a lab...
2018-02-27 09:06:59		Back to Issue 1. If we want to fix this, we would be looking to scrape all of the pubmed data  rather than just NC (an estimated 300hr process with extra hours for filtering duplicates.)   alternatively, we could just  not filter the specialists at all but this comes with its own risks. (still preferable but it leads us back to issue 2.)
2018-02-27 09:06:59		As for Janne, she's been working hard scraping the drug company data. sadly a good amount of her work  must be done manually. 
2018-02-27 15:29:47	Arun	Hey Jesse, just seeing your message now. Thanks for the update! 
2018-02-27 15:31:00	Arun	Regarding issue 1, we can try to write a write to check if we are getting data properly, say upto 1000 or 10000 rows. Once we are sure about the script, we can request a machine to Meaghan and we can run our script in that machine, instead of running in our personal machine 
2018-02-27 15:42:01	jesse	that sounds reasonable, but it may be better if we could just download the entire pubmed data set rather than webscraping: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/databases/download/pubmed_medline.html
2018-02-27 15:42:01		I'm not sure if this would be too much memory or not, but they also have daily update files so we wouldn't have to re-download it every time... we would just need a way to convert the xml to postgresql... [:+1:1] 
2018-02-27 15:48:34	Arun	Oh yeah, I didnt know we could download the data directly. 
2018-02-27 15:49:28	Arun	Btw, for this week I am yet to clock in and start working on specialist-disease relation 
2018-02-27 15:49:48	jesse	ya wanna task? 
2018-02-27 15:50:02	Arun	I've been busy with my stuff. I guess I will be able to work a maximum of only 8-10 hours this week and next week 
2018-02-27 15:50:53	Arun	I will try writing the script to manipulate the name according to the pubmed data and see if I can find matches 
2018-02-27 15:51:03	Arun	Once I am done with that work, I can work on other task 
2018-02-27 15:51:28	jesse	hold on with that. 
2018-02-27 15:51:46	Arun	Are you sure about it? 
2018-02-27 15:52:01	Arun	I can hold on it and work on something more important if there is any 
2018-02-27 15:54:13	jesse	part of this past meeting was that since we cannot just match first and last name, since many first names are not full names... So we wanted to link them to their universities. So if a person with the last name of Hayes went to Chapel Hill in pubmed, we could say that they are the same person who is listed in specialists as Hayes who went to Chapel Hill. Do ya follow? 
2018-02-27 15:54:49	Arun	Okay, I get it. Yeah, it makes sense 
2018-02-27 15:56:05	jesse	Also, If we download the entire pubmed thing... and somehow make it into a pubmed database, we will need to modify whatever script you were planning on writing. 
2018-02-27 15:56:28	Arun	But, Is it the only way to confirm if two persons are the same? Is there other possibilities to confirm that. I was thinking something like, if the name is Mathew Hayes and we have M Hayes, chances that they both are same is quite high, whats your thought on that? 
2018-02-27 15:58:23	jesse	we could check firstname too... but ideally we would want M Hayes from Chapel Hill === Mathew Hayes from Chapel Hill... If we are opening up all of pubmed to all of the specialists in the united states... then first and last name is no longer accurate enough.. since there are a ton of mathew hayes from the united states whereas maybe not so much with just NC. 
2018-02-27 15:58:50	Arun	Yeah agreed! 
2018-02-27 16:00:22	Arun	But since there are way too many pubmed data and too many specialists too, the computation could take more time when we start comparing different fields simulatenously, I thought. 
2018-02-27 16:00:22		But nevertheless, what you said would definitely work :slightly_smiling_face: 
2018-02-27 16:04:28	jesse	it would take more time, but it would maybe be a couple hour process just from a rough estimate i think 
2018-02-27 16:04:46	jesse	I'll still need to confirm with Kowolenko before we actually try to do this [:+1:1] 
2018-02-27 16:25:19	Arun	Yeah thats right. And Okay, so meanwhile what do you want me to work on? 
2018-02-27 16:28:18	jesse	I think you should look into trying to find a way to compare the medical school names and see if the medical school names in the specialists match with the pubmed affiliations. 
2018-02-27 16:40:26	Arun	Okay, I will look at that today and let you know when I am done with it 
2018-02-27 16:41:25	jesse	xD I wouldn't expect you to be done with it. but let me know what your thinking about that problem. Also figured we should clarify that for the specialists, we are referring to the data from http://medicare.gov (medicare.gov) rather than the other specialist data we gathered. 
2018-02-27 16:43:07	Arun	Ahh, I see. Alright. I will look into that website and see what data we've got. And yeah, I will let you know my thoughts before I actually start coding it 
2018-02-27 16:46:31	jesse	https://data.medicare.gov/Physician-Compare/Physician-Compare-National-Downloadable-File/mj5m-pzi6

[:heavy_check_mark:1 :+1:1 :slightly_smiling_face:1] 
2018-02-27 20:13:11	jesse	Hey Arun, have you been working on that problem? ^^ 
2018-02-27 20:13:48	Arun	Not yet Jesse, I was planning to look at it tonight post dinner 
2018-02-27 20:14:50	jesse	ahh I gotcha. I was just wonderin. I'm trying to decide what I wanna do, whether it's eat dinner, work on this, or go back to my apartment and play a video game :stuck_out_tongue: 
2018-02-27 20:38:51	Arun	Haha, sometime  of video game wouldn't hurt anything I believe! :smile: 
2018-02-27 21:09:54	jesse	sadly I chose to work on another project :disappointed: 
2018-02-28 13:25:40	Arun	Hey Jesse, afternoon! So, I checked out the website and also the pubmed data. What you said makes sense. 
2018-02-28 13:25:40		And once we make all the necessary calculations, we could probably try to sort the list with current NC specialist coming on the top and then in the order of nearest states wrt NC 
2018-02-28 13:26:39	Arun	But we are expected to finish all this by next thursday? 
2018-02-28 13:29:05	jesse	did you read the messages on the rarediseases channel? 
2018-02-28 13:29:16	Arun	Yes I did 
2018-02-28 13:29:29	Arun	I just checked out the messages there 
2018-02-28 13:32:14	jesse	i gotcha. yeah we are supposed to have something to show off by next thursday. I'm thinking the only truly difficult task we will have to deal with is comparing the names of the medical schools.  If we have to download all of the pubmed data, we will have a lot more troubles, which is why I'm going to try to run the script without the NC filter and see if it takes significantly more time or not. 
2018-02-28 13:34:42	Arun	Okay that would be a start. Do you want us to meet anytime this week or weekend? I fear I won't be available next week starting Monday :disappointed: 
2018-02-28 13:35:34	jesse	I'm going to charlotte starting thursday night up until next sunday... I won't be able to meet. I can do google hangouts though... but thats not as helpful 
2018-02-28 13:37:12	Arun	Ah, I see. Alright then, we will figure it out. But let's split up the work and finish it off as much as possible. 
2018-02-28 13:38:05	Arun	One question, why do you want to strip out the University names? Like, you were saying NC State University will result in 'state' which is not of any use. But, why do we have to it? 
2018-02-28 13:44:01	jesse	agreed. I'll have more information tonight... so it'll be clearer what all we need to do by the meeting time tomorrow. No matter what though, we need to find a way to compare the University names.
2018-02-28 13:44:01		As for that, the names of the affiliations in the pubmed data are not the same as the medical schools in the specialists data. We need to find a way to connect people on first/lastname (easy) and then by the university... my thought was that we could strip away some of the meaningless words so that we could match the names of the schools... but that won't work for the above reason you mentioned. Ingrams aren't too great either since swapping North Carolina State University also could match University of North Carolina State.
2018-02-28 13:44:01		Don't get too fixated on things that I say. I'm just trying to get you to understand the problem.  If you can find a way to keep all of the words in and determine that two schools are the same, all power to ya. 
2018-02-28 13:47:57	Arun	Haha, agreed. I understand you are trying to explain me the problem. :slightly_smiling_face: 
2018-02-28 13:50:23	Arun	And alright, meanwhile, let me know if you need anything! 
2018-02-28 13:50:40	jesse	Sure thing. 
2018-03-01 14:03:57	jesse	I posted the notes/todo thing I made for the week. take a look at that and then you can ask me if you have any questions. 
2018-03-01 20:16:16	Arun	Hey, I just had a look at it now. 
2018-03-01 20:19:33	Arun	I see there are immediate stuffs to get done with regard to matching physicians with pubmed data. Will you be working on any task particularly? 
2018-03-01 21:17:22	jesse	i havent decided the order Ill start tackling these things yet. sorry i didnt respond. i was driving 
2018-03-01 21:18:27	Arun	No worries! :slightly_smiling_face: And, let me know how we can go about it, if you got any leads 
2018-03-04 01:18:58	Arun	Hey, so for comparing the affiliation from pubmed and physician's medical school name, we can probably just check if medical school name is present in pubmed affiliation. 
2018-03-04 01:18:58		For example, as far as I noticed, the Physician's medical school name is pretty organised, but pubmed affiliations seem to have lot of redundant names.
2018-03-04 01:18:58		In this method, we can convert the physician's medical school name to an array and check if all the elements of the array is in pubmed affiliation. If so, we can assure that they both are the same person. 
2018-03-04 01:18:58		What do you think about this? 
2018-03-04 01:22:05	Arun	And for us to match physicians data from pubmed and physician data, the fastest method would be to put it in a DB and then querying it. 
2018-03-04 09:12:58	jesse	Hey Arun, I agree that the pubmed data is scattered and that the physician data is more organized and condensed. however, I dont think it will be enough to just check if the physician med school is in the affiliation.
2018-03-04 09:12:58		Have you taken a look at certain schools that would and would not match under this scenario? If you have, and you are comfortable with the results that gives, then sure... but im thinking we may need to worry about ngrams and abbreviations.
2018-03-04 09:12:58		Ive been trying to compile a list of all schools contained in the pubmed data and sort them, but it's been running for twelve hours and I dont think itll finish. maybe i should try a much smaller dataset.. 
2018-03-04 09:18:25	jesse	I've got a list  of the affiliations that came from diseases beginning with X-Z 
2018-03-04 09:19:24	jesse	maybe we can use that and the list of med schools from the physician data to help us determine a good matching system. 
2018-03-04 09:30:50	jesse	I also had Sagar working a lil bit on this. I gave him a list of 400 med school names that came from the physician data and had him make abbreviations for each one. (i hope he wrote a program to do this lol) 
2018-03-04 12:00:15	Arun	Right, and for matching two med school names, I can probably write a script that would take care of abbreviations too. It will be very similar to the script I wrote for comparing names in any order 
2018-03-04 12:06:22	jesse	ok. if you can, try to make it so that we arent loading the entire CSVs into the script.
2018-03-04 12:06:22		many of these files are gigabytes of text, so we will run out of memory if we do that. 
2018-03-04 12:15:54	Arun	Right, well I?m sure of how to do that part. Like, I can read from the CSV and for each line in the CSV, I will have to read from the physician?s CSV. But, in this way, for each ?row? in the pubmed, I will be reading all the rows from the physician CSV, every time. 
2018-03-04 12:15:54		Is there any other way that you know of? 
2018-03-04 12:16:11	Arun	I mean, I?m *not sure of how to do that part 
2018-03-04 12:30:35	jesse	I'm not sure either. 
2018-03-04 12:39:42	jesse	I'm gonna try to filter out the duplicates out of the pubmed data once again and see what the file size is. 
2018-03-04 12:56:03	jesse	Are you working on raredx stuff right now? 
2018-03-04 12:58:02	Arun	I'm guessing the best way to go forward would be to put it on a DB and query data. 
2018-03-04 12:58:52	Arun	Anyway, I am not working on it right now. 
2018-03-04 13:07:09	jesse	put what specifically on the db? 
2018-03-04 13:07:34	Arun	Both, the pubmed data and the physician data. Instead of having it on a CSV 
2018-03-04 13:09:25	Arun	Do you believe our searching would be faster that way? 
2018-03-04 13:15:59	jesse	I'm not sure it would matter. once pandas loads it into memory, it doesn't matter. if you were thinking of doing some sort of join statement or some python thing that worked directly with psql, then it would be faster. 
2018-03-04 15:08:59	Arun	Yeah, thats true too, alright then 
2018-03-04 20:08:59	jesse	arun, do you have a script for the medschool comparison? 
2018-03-04 21:03:00	Arun	Hey, I will send you in sometime, like half hour? I am on my way home now from outside 
2018-03-04 21:03:51	jesse	sounds good 
2018-03-04 22:23:18	Arun	Hi Jesse :slightly_smiling_face: 
2018-03-04 22:24:51	Arun	Can I send the script here? 
2018-03-04 22:27:56	Arun	@Arun uploaded a file: https://ncstateuniversityitng.slack.com/files/U95TJ10M9/F9JFZ3Z45/comparemednames.py (compareMedNames.py) and commented: Script that compares Medical School Names from pubmed data and physcian data 
2018-03-04 22:30:22	Arun	I ran this script by taking names manually form the pubmed csv and the physician data. And it worked fine for the names I used. 
2018-03-04 22:31:42	Arun	I wouldn't say this script works very fine.  There will definitely be some good amount of false positive. But since we are already comparing the names, and this is more like a second factor to affirm our decision if two persons are the same, I'm hoping this would work fine. 
2018-03-04 22:36:20	Arun	@Arun uploaded a file: https://ncstateuniversityitng.slack.com/files/U95TJ10M9/F9JBS09T6/pip_package_for_fuzzywuzzy.txt (pip package for fuzzywuzzy) and commented: Forgot to mention, you need to install the fuzzywuzzy package for this. 
2018-03-04 23:04:26	jesse	I'll take a look tomorrow. i appreciate it dude. i tried to run a script tonight but my computer froze again.... these files are just too big :( 
2018-03-05 00:21:37	Arun	Ah, I see. Yeah please run it tomorrow and let me know how it runs against our data. :slightly_smiling_face: Thanks Jesse 
2018-03-05 00:21:58	Arun	And also, do you want my script for name comparison as well? 
2018-03-05 07:13:07	jesse	yes plz. anything would help. 
2018-03-05 10:25:10	Arun	Okay, I will slightly modify whatever I?ve coded and send you in sometime. 
2018-03-05 10:25:10		I?m not working on it right now, but I?ll send you! Is that okay? 
2018-03-05 10:25:36	jesse	yeah. 
2018-03-05 10:25:40	jesse	Thanks 
2018-03-05 16:44:45	Arun	@Arun uploaded a file: https://ncstateuniversityitng.slack.com/files/U95TJ10M9/F9JBZ2HND/comparenames.py (compareNames.py) 
2018-03-06 14:54:17	Arun	Hey Jesse, I am so sorry, I have an important interview this Thursday and thus I am unable to work on it, as I have to prepare myself for the interview. I hope you understand and its alright. I will be back only by Thursday night. 
2018-03-06 14:56:03	jesse	yeah I got you. just means more money for me :stuck_out_tongue: 
2018-03-06 14:56:44	jesse	I might get Michael or meaghan to help code some of this up too. xD 
2018-03-08 18:51:24	Arun	Hi Jesse. 
2018-03-08 18:51:30	Arun	How you doing? 
2018-03-08 18:51:57	Arun	Is there anything that you want me to work on? I can work on it tomorrow 
2018-03-08 19:34:53	jesse	hey dude. ya know that list, YetAnotherMedicalSchoolList? 
2018-03-08 19:41:28	jesse	I would like the medical schools, all 404 of them  to have which state that they came from. This will be a big help with the comparisons.
2018-03-08 19:41:28		right now, I only have a program that gets the NC comparisons. this was done for the sake of efficiency... the program as it is takes 30 mins to run. with all 50 states, its gonna take 24 hours if we generate sql statements for all of them.... this is still far better than the estimated 600 days that a nested for loop would cause. 
2018-03-08 19:42:18	jesse	and I'm doing alright. i needed to run the pubmed data once more which kinda sucks. 
2018-03-09 02:45:49	Arun	YetAnotherMedicalSchoolList? I am not aware of that list 
2018-03-09 03:11:18	Arun	Oh, we have created all the databases now? 
2018-03-09 08:01:13	jesse	oh sorry i mustve spoken to sagar about that one 
2018-03-09 08:02:08	jesse	we dont have all the databases now since i got one generating right now. its the pubmed junk again. 
2018-03-09 08:03:20	jesse	YetAnotherMedicalSchoolList is something where I took all of the specialists medical schools and filtered out all the duplicates. its in the google drive 
2018-03-09 08:04:01	jesse	there were a few different lists of medical schools at this point, so thats what I decided to call it. 
2018-03-09 08:12:22	jesse	I've also got a program for checking for matches in the med schools. we need that program to match as many as possible without doing something complex like n grams... i think. if we do the ngrams, our program will take forever to run... although it may be feasible for just NC. 
2018-03-09 08:13:02	jesse	if you'd like to try to upgrade that program, feel free. 
2018-03-09 08:18:48	jesse	if you want to see those 2 programs, theyre in power6a under/home/jlsimps4/ForTheGreatAndPowerfulMichael/
2018-03-09 08:18:48		since michael was wanting to look into them.
2018-03-09 08:18:48		they require a database for the specialists and the pubmed stuff, so you can find those csvs in the ForMeaghan folder... to convert between the two, you can just use a psql \copy statement 
2018-03-09 19:23:01	Arun	Hey Jesse, I?m just checking out your messages. So comparing med schools, you have written a separate script? 
2018-03-09 19:24:02	Arun	And, you took the YetAnotherMedicalSchoolList from the already available specialist data ( that website you sent me previously) , I believe? 
2018-03-09 19:34:00	jesse	yep. the scripts are in the pubmed-crawler folder in the rarediseases repo 
2018-03-09 19:35:33	Arun	Okay I will look into it!  
2018-03-09 19:36:58	Arun	So, you want me to do which state does these universities/medical school come from eh?  
2018-03-09 19:38:46	jesse	yeah. preferably the two letter code. NC for north carolina. I asked sagar to look at the same thing so you may want to message him. And maybe put messages in the patientportalpeeps channel since I've had to repeat myself for both you and Sagar. 
2018-03-10 15:18:08	Arun	Alright I will talk to Sagar and check where he is 
2018-03-10 21:39:13	Arun	Hey. I checked with Sagar, he said he is good with doing that part. So, is there something else I could work on?  
2018-03-10 21:40:53	jesse	have you seen the script for the medschool comparisons ? 
2018-03-10 21:51:09	jesse	There are 2, getPhysicianPubmedConnection.py and compareMedSchools.py
2018-03-10 21:51:09		We are no longer deleting the duplicates from the pubmed dataset because we are keeping the disease ids with the articles... What this means is that it will take longer for the program  to run. We need to make it more efficient if possible.
2018-03-10 21:51:09		As for the second file, we need to do whatever we can to get more medical schools to match... this could be achieved by doing Ngrams or by removing more nonsense words. 
2018-03-10 21:51:09		and last of all, you can check if Janne needs help with the drug companies. I havent heard back from her.
2018-03-10 21:51:09		That is all I would know to do. There are also some issues you could look into on github. 
2018-03-10 21:55:19	jesse	Also stuff about Mesh terms when gathering the pubmed data... but I think we should hold off on that until we figure out  how to get these comparisons efficiently. [:+1:1] 
2018-03-11 14:39:29	Arun	I did check those scripts recently, but I will do go through it again today or tomorrow, to start looking into it. I will look at the compareMedSchools.py and see what we can we do it make it match better. 
2018-03-11 14:40:21	Arun	And yes, I will check with Janne too, and see if she is doing okay. 
2018-04-12 13:45:44	jesse	Hey Arun, in the meeting today, it seemed like you finished whatever you were doing, and the team wanted you to help me out with researching the Alternative Medicines. We don't really have any leads on that, just need to find out what sources are good for that and what we can scrape. 
2018-04-12 13:46:20	Arun	Hi Jesse, I was just about to ping you regarding the same  
2018-04-12 13:46:59	Arun	So, I need to look out for data on alternative medicines? 
2018-04-12 13:49:41	jesse	yep. do google searches, or whatever you can to build up a list of websites that we can scrape data from. 
2018-04-12 13:49:58	Arun	Yes, I can do that  
2018-04-12 13:51:01	jesse	I'll be doing the same thing, so let me know if you find anything, and I will let you know if I find anything. If we find something good enough to scrape, then we can focus on that, but for now, lets just get links. 
2018-04-12 15:08:33	Arun	Okaaay sure, sounds good  
2018-04-16 20:35:57	jesse	Hey Arun, have you been looking into alternative medicine resources? 
2018-04-17 03:47:28	Arun	Hey sorry Jesse, I was held up with my project work for the DevOps course and I am done with that just now. I will be working on it from today (Tuesday) evening  
2018-04-17 12:49:20	jesse	sorry I thought I responded to this. That's fine. I've found a few resources if you want me to give them to ya. However, I'm just trying to think about how we can turn that into something helpful to visitors of our websites, since terminology is very different in the herbal remedy world.

2018-02-16 19:47:37	jesse	ok i pushed the stuff. 
2018-02-16 19:47:41	Arun	So, I?ll go through everything and see if I?m able to understand everything that we?ve got! And Sunday I?ll ask you the questions if I have any, and we can probably sit together and get done with this part!  
2018-02-16 19:48:50	jesse	Sounds good. 
2018-02-17 21:28:14	Arun	Hey Jesse, Will you be free post lunch tomorrow? 
2018-02-18 07:54:57	jesse	yeah 
2018-02-18 11:11:16	Arun	Great, shall we meet at 4pm today then? For about 1-2 hours maximum  
2018-02-18 11:20:23	jesse	Sounds good. I've been doing quite a bit of work to this script. for the most part, I just need to let you know what my current code gathers, the errors I'm running into, what needs to be done with the outputted CSV files, and stuff like that. My thinking is after we meet at 4, I can hand the rest of the work concerning pubmed stuff to you, and I can then switch to working on the drug company data and some of the other minor tasks. 
2018-02-18 14:38:33	Arun	Sure, I?ll be in Hunt grad commons. I?ve booked room number 4314  
2018-02-18 14:39:18	jesse	can undergrads go there? 
2018-02-18 14:40:01	Arun	Ah, I totally forgot about that! But I guess you can come inside if I'm with you 
2018-02-18 14:41:52	jesse	ok. are you there now or should i wait till 4? 
2018-02-18 14:42:16	Arun	I am here in library. We can meet now, sure! But the room is available only from 4 
2018-02-18 14:42:40	Arun	So, if you can find another room, I sure can come 
2018-02-18 14:46:44	jesse	I just checked. there is no room available that I can reserve.  
2018-02-18 14:47:03	Arun	Yeah, that's what I thought too! 
2018-02-18 14:47:29	Arun	Anyway, we can still meet now if you wish 
2018-02-18 14:52:32	jesse	sure. I'm just laying in my bed anyway. give me a few minutes to finish the current csv my computer is workin on and so I can make tea /get ready to leave 
2018-02-18 14:52:56	Arun	Yeah sure, take your time! :slightly_smiling_face: 
2018-02-18 15:03:18	jesse	im at the library now 
2018-02-18 15:03:46	Arun	Oh good. Can you come to 4th floor? I'll come near the lift 
2018-02-18 18:36:25	jesse	Did you specify in LibreOffice that the CSV's were comma separated when you opened it? 
2018-02-18 18:36:50	jesse	usually it says "separate by [] comma  [] semicolon [] space... etc 
2018-02-18 18:37:18	jesse	In the big CSV, I'm getting no entries that are overflowing. 
2018-02-18 18:39:05	jesse	Same with the little csv 
2018-02-18 18:40:22	Arun	Ah really? Damn, I didn?t notice that! But yeah, the next time I open it I?ll check that too 
2018-02-18 18:44:23	jesse	I'm gonna run the entire thing once more to try to locate the XML parsing error. hopefully I'll be able to narrow it down to a place and put a try/except thing around it to just skip the document if it fails to parse. 
2018-02-18 18:44:56	jesse	If you already have that stacktrace in your terminal, could you check the line number? 
2018-02-18 18:50:04	jesse	i think i'll just put an except around the search/query part. my guess is thats where the issue is. 
2018-02-18 18:58:01	Arun	Gimme sometime, I?ll check and let you know the line number  
2018-02-18 19:27:34	Arun	My new CSV is being generated now, and I cannot check back the stacktrace 
2018-02-18 19:27:51	jesse	thats ok. I've got a CSV generating myself. 
2018-02-18 19:28:38	jesse	quick trick: if you run "tmux" you can detach the terminal so that you can close out of the terminal and do other things while the program is being run in the background. [:+1:1 :heavy_check_mark:1] 
2018-02-18 21:16:47	jesse	I got the full csv and it's beautiful 
2018-02-18 21:17:20	jesse	i mean, its what you'd expect... a csv, but I've been working quite hard just to get it lol 
2018-02-18 21:23:57	jesse	also, I don't think I pulled your changes, since you removed the fun stuff like abstract and title 
2018-02-19 18:23:21	jesse	Hey Arun, you have yurika working on your computer right? 
2018-02-19 18:23:45	jesse	Janne was wanting to use it for getting info on drug companies. 
2018-02-19 20:40:41	Arun	Hey yeah, I have it in Running! Sorry, for the late reply  
2018-02-19 20:41:27	Arun	Janne wants to use it? Sure, we can try using it. But the websites that we use should allow crawling  
2018-02-19 20:42:18	jesse	cool. I'm not sure what Janne needs. I was working with her tonight and the drug company information is chaos. I'll try to ask Janne and get her to message 
2018-02-19 20:42:19	jesse	you 
2018-02-19 20:42:35	Arun	Or I can ping Janne right away and save some time :)  
2018-02-19 20:43:08	jesse	cool! I hope it works out. 
2018-02-19 20:43:22	Arun	Alright, pinged her now!  
2018-02-19 20:44:11	jesse	Thanks dude. i tried it on my computer but i think postgresql is forever broke on my computer from trying to mess with agensgraph 
2018-02-19 20:44:58	Arun	Ah, I see! Alright, not an issue! Let?s see if we are able to get the data using Yurika  
2018-02-26 12:51:32	Arun	Hey Jesse, I just realized that I have some work for today evening. Is it alright if we push today's meeting to tomorrow? 
2018-02-26 12:58:37	jesse	i guess that depends on everyone else. i could probably meet both today and tomorrow and not run out of things to do. 
2018-02-26 12:59:04	Arun	Okay, If others are making it, I'll try to make it too! 
2018-02-26 12:59:56	jesse	ok. if not, I can just let you know what happens, whether its by text or meeting up tomorrow. 
2018-02-26 13:00:39	Arun	Alright, that's great! I'll keep you posted :slightly_smiling_face: 
2018-02-27 09:06:59	jesse	Hey Arun, I met up with Sagar last night, and Janne separately. we've got a few issues with the pubmed stuff.
2018-02-27 09:06:59		I'll give ya a quick run down:
2018-02-27 09:06:59		our pubmed data filtered everyone who were affiliated with medical schools in NC
2018-02-27 09:06:59		our specialist data filtered everyone whos hospital was in NC.
2018-02-27 09:06:59		issue 1.   many people work in NC hospitals and have their medical degrees from places outside of NC.
2018-02-27 09:06:59		but lets ignore that for now.
2018-02-27 09:06:59		issue 2. the medical schools in the pubmed data is not uniform with the specialists data for schools they came from. matching UNC Chapel Hill would be fairly easy since Chapel Hill is unique... but take North Carolina State University... filter out the unnecessary words like "north carolina" and "university" and your left with ..."state"... which doesnt help. also consider that many pubmed researchers dont seem to be affiliated with a university or school of medicine... but rather just a lab...
2018-02-27 09:06:59		Back to Issue 1. If we want to fix this, we would be looking to scrape all of the pubmed data  rather than just NC (an estimated 300hr process with extra hours for filtering duplicates.)   alternatively, we could just  not filter the specialists at all but this comes with its own risks. (still preferable but it leads us back to issue 2.)
2018-02-27 09:06:59		As for Janne, she's been working hard scraping the drug company data. sadly a good amount of her work  must be done manually. 
2018-02-27 15:29:47	Arun	Hey Jesse, just seeing your message now. Thanks for the update! 
2018-02-27 15:31:00	Arun	Regarding issue 1, we can try to write a write to check if we are getting data properly, say upto 1000 or 10000 rows. Once we are sure about the script, we can request a machine to Meaghan and we can run our script in that machine, instead of running in our personal machine 
2018-02-27 15:42:01	jesse	that sounds reasonable, but it may be better if we could just download the entire pubmed data set rather than webscraping: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/databases/download/pubmed_medline.html
2018-02-27 15:42:01		I'm not sure if this would be too much memory or not, but they also have daily update files so we wouldn't have to re-download it every time... we would just need a way to convert the xml to postgresql... [:+1:1] 
2018-02-27 15:48:34	Arun	Oh yeah, I didnt know we could download the data directly. 
2018-02-27 15:49:28	Arun	Btw, for this week I am yet to clock in and start working on specialist-disease relation 
2018-02-27 15:49:48	jesse	ya wanna task? 
2018-02-27 15:50:02	Arun	I've been busy with my stuff. I guess I will be able to work a maximum of only 8-10 hours this week and next week 
2018-02-27 15:50:53	Arun	I will try writing the script to manipulate the name according to the pubmed data and see if I can find matches 
2018-02-27 15:51:03	Arun	Once I am done with that work, I can work on other task 
2018-02-27 15:51:28	jesse	hold on with that. 
2018-02-27 15:51:46	Arun	Are you sure about it? 
2018-02-27 15:52:01	Arun	I can hold on it and work on something more important if there is any 
2018-02-27 15:54:13	jesse	part of this past meeting was that since we cannot just match first and last name, since many first names are not full names... So we wanted to link them to their universities. So if a person with the last name of Hayes went to Chapel Hill in pubmed, we could say that they are the same person who is listed in specialists as Hayes who went to Chapel Hill. Do ya follow? 
2018-02-27 15:54:49	Arun	Okay, I get it. Yeah, it makes sense 
2018-02-27 15:56:05	jesse	Also, If we download the entire pubmed thing... and somehow make it into a pubmed database, we will need to modify whatever script you were planning on writing. 
2018-02-27 15:56:28	Arun	But, Is it the only way to confirm if two persons are the same? Is there other possibilities to confirm that. I was thinking something like, if the name is Mathew Hayes and we have M Hayes, chances that they both are same is quite high, whats your thought on that? 
2018-02-27 15:58:23	jesse	we could check firstname too... but ideally we would want M Hayes from Chapel Hill === Mathew Hayes from Chapel Hill... If we are opening up all of pubmed to all of the specialists in the united states... then first and last name is no longer accurate enough.. since there are a ton of mathew hayes from the united states whereas maybe not so much with just NC. 
2018-02-27 15:58:50	Arun	Yeah agreed! 
2018-02-27 16:00:22	Arun	But since there are way too many pubmed data and too many specialists too, the computation could take more time when we start comparing different fields simulatenously, I thought. 
2018-02-27 16:00:22		But nevertheless, what you said would definitely work :slightly_smiling_face: 
2018-02-27 16:04:28	jesse	it would take more time, but it would maybe be a couple hour process just from a rough estimate i think 
2018-02-27 16:04:46	jesse	I'll still need to confirm with Kowolenko before we actually try to do this [:+1:1] 
2018-02-27 16:25:19	Arun	Yeah thats right. And Okay, so meanwhile what do you want me to work on? 
2018-02-27 16:28:18	jesse	I think you should look into trying to find a way to compare the medical school names and see if the medical school names in the specialists match with the pubmed affiliations. 
2018-02-27 16:40:26	Arun	Okay, I will look at that today and let you know when I am done with it 
2018-02-27 16:41:25	jesse	xD I wouldn't expect you to be done with it. but let me know what your thinking about that problem. Also figured we should clarify that for the specialists, we are referring to the data from http://medicare.gov (medicare.gov) rather than the other specialist data we gathered. 
2018-02-27 16:43:07	Arun	Ahh, I see. Alright. I will look into that website and see what data we've got. And yeah, I will let you know my thoughts before I actually start coding it 
2018-02-27 16:46:31	jesse	https://data.medicare.gov/Physician-Compare/Physician-Compare-National-Downloadable-File/mj5m-pzi6
2018-02-27 16:46:31		Physician Compare National Downloadable File | Data.Medicare.gov
2018-02-27 16:46:31		Physician Compare National Downloadable File - The Physician Compare National Downloadable File is organized at the individual eligible professional level; each line is unique at the professional/enrollment record/Group Practice/address level. Professionals with multiple Medicare enrollment records and/or single enrollments linking to multiple practice location addresses are listed on multiple lines. [:heavy_check_mark:1 :+1:1 :slightly_smiling_face:1] 
2018-02-27 20:13:11	jesse	Hey Arun, have you been working on that problem? ^^ 
2018-02-27 20:13:48	Arun	Not yet Jesse, I was planning to look at it tonight post dinner 
2018-02-27 20:14:50	jesse	ahh I gotcha. I was just wonderin. I'm trying to decide what I wanna do, whether it's eat dinner, work on this, or go back to my apartment and play a video game :stuck_out_tongue: 
2018-02-27 20:38:51	Arun	Haha, sometime  of video game wouldn't hurt anything I believe! :smile: 
2018-02-27 21:09:54	jesse	sadly I chose to work on another project :disappointed: 
2018-02-28 13:25:40	Arun	Hey Jesse, afternoon! So, I checked out the website and also the pubmed data. What you said makes sense. 
2018-02-28 13:25:40		And once we make all the necessary calculations, we could probably try to sort the list with current NC specialist coming on the top and then in the order of nearest states wrt NC 
2018-02-28 13:26:39	Arun	But we are expected to finish all this by next thursday? 
2018-02-28 13:29:05	jesse	did you read the messages on the rarediseases channel? 
2018-02-28 13:29:16	Arun	Yes I did 
2018-02-28 13:29:29	Arun	I just checked out the messages there 
2018-02-28 13:32:14	jesse	i gotcha. yeah we are supposed to have something to show off by next thursday. I'm thinking the only truly difficult task we will have to deal with is comparing the names of the medical schools.  If we have to download all of the pubmed data, we will have a lot more troubles, which is why I'm going to try to run the script without the NC filter and see if it takes significantly more time or not. 
2018-02-28 13:34:42	Arun	Okay that would be a start. Do you want us to meet anytime this week or weekend? I fear I won't be available next week starting Monday :disappointed: 
2018-02-28 13:35:34	jesse	I'm going to charlotte starting thursday night up until next sunday... I won't be able to meet. I can do google hangouts though... but thats not as helpful 
2018-02-28 13:37:12	Arun	Ah, I see. Alright then, we will figure it out. But let's split up the work and finish it off as much as possible. 
2018-02-28 13:38:05	Arun	One question, why do you want to strip out the University names? Like, you were saying NC State University will result in 'state' which is not of any use. But, why do we have to it? 
2018-02-28 13:44:01	jesse	agreed. I'll have more information tonight... so it'll be clearer what all we need to do by the meeting time tomorrow. No matter what though, we need to find a way to compare the University names.
2018-02-28 13:44:01		As for that, the names of the affiliations in the pubmed data are not the same as the medical schools in the specialists data. We need to find a way to connect people on first/lastname (easy) and then by the university... my thought was that we could strip away some of the meaningless words so that we could match the names of the schools... but that won't work for the above reason you mentioned. Ingrams aren't too great either since swapping North Carolina State University also could match University of North Carolina State.
2018-02-28 13:44:01		Don't get too fixated on things that I say. I'm just trying to get you to understand the problem.  If you can find a way to keep all of the words in and determine that two schools are the same, all power to ya. 
2018-02-28 13:47:57	Arun	Haha, agreed. I understand you are trying to explain me the problem. :slightly_smiling_face: 
2018-02-28 13:50:23	Arun	And alright, meanwhile, let me know if you need anything! 
2018-02-28 13:50:40	jesse	Sure thing. 
2018-03-01 14:03:57	jesse	I posted the notes/todo thing I made for the week. take a look at that and then you can ask me if you have any questions. 
2018-03-01 20:16:16	Arun	Hey, I just had a look at it now. 
2018-03-01 20:19:33	Arun	I see there are immediate stuffs to get done with regard to matching physicians with pubmed data. Will you be working on any task particularly? 
2018-03-01 21:17:22	jesse	i havent decided the order Ill start tackling these things yet. sorry i didnt respond. i was driving 
2018-03-01 21:18:27	Arun	No worries! :slightly_smiling_face: And, let me know how we can go about it, if you got any leads 
2018-03-04 01:18:58	Arun	Hey, so for comparing the affiliation from pubmed and physician's medical school name, we can probably just check if medical school name is present in pubmed affiliation. 
2018-03-04 01:18:58		For example, as far as I noticed, the Physician's medical school name is pretty organised, but pubmed affiliations seem to have lot of redundant names.
2018-03-04 01:18:58		In this method, we can convert the physician's medical school name to an array and check if all the elements of the array is in pubmed affiliation. If so, we can assure that they both are the same person. 
2018-03-04 01:18:58		What do you think about this? 
2018-03-04 01:22:05	Arun	And for us to match physicians data from pubmed and physician data, the fastest method would be to put it in a DB and then querying it. 
2018-03-04 09:12:58	jesse	Hey Arun, I agree that the pubmed data is scattered and that the physician data is more organized and condensed. however, I dont think it will be enough to just check if the physician med school is in the affiliation.
2018-03-04 09:12:58		Have you taken a look at certain schools that would and would not match under this scenario? If you have, and you are comfortable with the results that gives, then sure... but im thinking we may need to worry about ngrams and abbreviations.
2018-03-04 09:12:58		Ive been trying to compile a list of all schools contained in the pubmed data and sort them, but it's been running for twelve hours and I dont think itll finish. maybe i should try a much smaller dataset.. 
2018-03-04 09:18:25	jesse	I've got a list  of the affiliations that came from diseases beginning with X-Z 
2018-03-04 09:19:24	jesse	maybe we can use that and the list of med schools from the physician data to help us determine a good matching system. 
2018-03-04 09:30:50	jesse	I also had Sagar working a lil bit on this. I gave him a list of 400 med school names that came from the physician data and had him make abbreviations for each one. (i hope he wrote a program to do this lol) 
2018-03-04 12:00:15	Arun	Right, and for matching two med school names, I can probably write a script that would take care of abbreviations too. It will be very similar to the script I wrote for comparing names in any order 
2018-03-04 12:06:22	jesse	ok. if you can, try to make it so that we arent loading the entire CSVs into the script.
2018-03-04 12:06:22		many of these files are gigabytes of text, so we will run out of memory if we do that. 
2018-03-04 12:15:54	Arun	Right, well I?m sure of how to do that part. Like, I can read from the CSV and for each line in the CSV, I will have to read from the physician?s CSV. But, in this way, for each ?row? in the pubmed, I will be reading all the rows from the physician CSV, every time. 
2018-03-04 12:15:54		Is there any other way that you know of? 
2018-03-04 12:16:11	Arun	I mean, I?m *not sure of how to do that part 
2018-03-04 12:30:35	jesse	I'm not sure either. 
2018-03-04 12:39:42	jesse	I'm gonna try to filter out the duplicates out of the pubmed data once again and see what the file size is. 
2018-03-04 12:56:03	jesse	Are you working on raredx stuff right now? 
2018-03-04 12:58:02	Arun	I'm guessing the best way to go forward would be to put it on a DB and query data. 
2018-03-04 12:58:52	Arun	Anyway, I am not working on it right now. 
2018-03-04 13:07:09	jesse	put what specifically on the db? 
2018-03-04 13:07:34	Arun	Both, the pubmed data and the physician data. Instead of having it on a CSV 
2018-03-04 13:09:25	Arun	Do you believe our searching would be faster that way? 
2018-03-04 13:15:59	jesse	I'm not sure it would matter. once pandas loads it into memory, it doesn't matter. if you were thinking of doing some sort of join statement or some python thing that worked directly with psql, then it would be faster. 
2018-03-04 15:08:59	Arun	Yeah, thats true too, alright then 
2018-03-04 20:08:59	jesse	arun, do you have a script for the medschool comparison? 
2018-03-04 21:03:00	Arun	Hey, I will send you in sometime, like half hour? I am on my way home now from outside 
2018-03-04 21:03:51	jesse	sounds good 
2018-03-04 22:23:18	Arun	Hi Jesse :slightly_smiling_face: 
2018-03-04 22:24:51	Arun	Can I send the script here? 
2018-03-04 22:27:56	Arun	@Arun uploaded a file: https://ncstateuniversityitng.slack.com/files/U95TJ10M9/F9JFZ3Z45/comparemednames.py (compareMedNames.py) and commented: Script that compares Medical School Names from pubmed data and physcian data 
2018-03-04 22:30:22	Arun	I ran this script by taking names manually form the pubmed csv and the physician data. And it worked fine for the names I used. 
2018-03-04 22:31:42	Arun	I wouldn't say this script works very fine.  There will definitely be some good amount of false positive. But since we are already comparing the names, and this is more like a second factor to affirm our decision if two persons are the same, I'm hoping this would work fine. 
2018-03-04 22:36:20	Arun	@Arun uploaded a file: https://ncstateuniversityitng.slack.com/files/U95TJ10M9/F9JBS09T6/pip_package_for_fuzzywuzzy.txt (pip package for fuzzywuzzy) and commented: Forgot to mention, you need to install the fuzzywuzzy package for this. 
2018-03-04 23:04:26	jesse	I'll take a look tomorrow. i appreciate it dude. i tried to run a script tonight but my computer froze again.... these files are just too big :( 
2018-03-05 00:21:37	Arun	Ah, I see. Yeah please run it tomorrow and let me know how it runs against our data. :slightly_smiling_face: Thanks Jesse 
2018-03-05 00:21:58	Arun	And also, do you want my script for name comparison as well? 
2018-03-05 07:13:07	jesse	yes plz. anything would help. 
2018-03-05 10:25:10	Arun	Okay, I will slightly modify whatever I?ve coded and send you in sometime. 
2018-03-05 10:25:10		I?m not working on it right now, but I?ll send you! Is that okay? 
2018-03-05 10:25:36	jesse	yeah. 
2018-03-05 10:25:40	jesse	Thanks

2018-03-06 14:54:17	Arun	Hey Jesse, I am so sorry, I have an important interview this Thursday and thus I am unable to work on it, as I have to prepare myself for the interview. I hope you understand and its alright. I will be back only by Thursday night. 
2018-03-06 14:56:03	jesse	yeah I got you. just means more money for me :stuck_out_tongue: 
2018-03-06 14:56:44	jesse	I might get Michael or meaghan to help code some of this up too. xD 
2018-03-08 18:51:24	Arun	Hi Jesse. 
2018-03-08 18:51:30	Arun	How you doing? 
2018-03-08 18:51:57	Arun	Is there anything that you want me to work on? I can work on it tomorrow 
2018-03-08 19:34:53	jesse	hey dude. ya know that list, YetAnotherMedicalSchoolList? 
2018-03-08 19:41:28	jesse	I would like the medical schools, all 404 of them  to have which state that they came from. This will be a big help with the comparisons.
2018-03-08 19:41:28		right now, I only have a program that gets the NC comparisons. this was done for the sake of efficiency... the program as it is takes 30 mins to run. with all 50 states, its gonna take 24 hours if we generate sql statements for all of them.... this is still far better than the estimated 600 days that a nested for loop would cause. 
2018-03-08 19:42:18	jesse	and I'm doing alright. i needed to run the pubmed data once more which kinda sucks. 
2018-03-09 02:45:49	Arun	YetAnotherMedicalSchoolList? I am not aware of that list 
2018-03-09 03:11:18	Arun	Oh, we have created all the databases now? 
2018-03-09 08:01:13	jesse	oh sorry i mustve spoken to sagar about that one 
2018-03-09 08:02:08	jesse	we dont have all the databases now since i got one generating right now. its the pubmed junk again. 
2018-03-09 08:03:20	jesse	YetAnotherMedicalSchoolList is something where I took all of the specialists medical schools and filtered out all the duplicates. its in the google drive 
2018-03-09 08:04:01	jesse	there were a few different lists of medical schools at this point, so thats what I decided to call it. 
2018-03-09 08:12:22	jesse	I've also got a program for checking for matches in the med schools. we need that program to match as many as possible without doing something complex like n grams... i think. if we do the ngrams, our program will take forever to run... although it may be feasible for just NC. 
2018-03-09 08:13:02	jesse	if you'd like to try to upgrade that program, feel free. 
2018-03-09 08:18:48	jesse	if you want to see those 2 programs, theyre in power6a under/home/jlsimps4/ForTheGreatAndPowerfulMichael/
2018-03-09 08:18:48		since michael was wanting to look into them.
2018-03-09 08:18:48		they require a database for the specialists and the pubmed stuff, so you can find those csvs in the ForMeaghan folder... to convert between the two, you can just use a psql \copy statement 
2018-03-09 19:23:01	Arun	Hey Jesse, I?m just checking out your messages. So comparing med schools, you have written a separate script? 
2018-03-09 19:24:02	Arun	And, you took the YetAnotherMedicalSchoolList from the already available specialist data ( that website you sent me previously) , I believe? 
2018-03-09 19:34:00	jesse	yep. the scripts are in the pubmed-crawler folder in the rarediseases repo 
2018-03-09 19:35:33	Arun	Okay I will look into it!  
2018-03-09 19:36:58	Arun	So, you want me to do which state does these universities/medical school come from eh?  
2018-03-09 19:38:46	jesse	yeah. preferably the two letter code. NC for north carolina. I asked sagar to look at the same thing so you may want to message him. And maybe put messages in the patientportalpeeps channel since I've had to repeat myself for both you and Sagar. 
2018-03-10 15:18:08	Arun	Alright I will talk to Sagar and check where he is 
2018-03-10 21:39:13	Arun	Hey. I checked with Sagar, he said he is good with doing that part. So, is there something else I could work on?  
2018-03-10 21:40:53	jesse	have you seen the script for the medschool comparisons ? 
2018-03-10 21:51:09	jesse	There are 2, getPhysicianPubmedConnection.py and compareMedSchools.py
2018-03-10 21:51:09		We are no longer deleting the duplicates from the pubmed dataset because we are keeping the disease ids with the articles... What this means is that it will take longer for the program  to run. We need to make it more efficient if possible.
2018-03-10 21:51:09		As for the second file, we need to do whatever we can to get more medical schools to match... this could be achieved by doing Ngrams or by removing more nonsense words. 
2018-03-10 21:51:09		and last of all, you can check if Janne needs help with the drug companies. I havent heard back from her.
2018-03-10 21:51:09		That is all I would know to do. There are also some issues you could look into on github. 
2018-03-10 21:55:19	jesse	Also stuff about Mesh terms when gathering the pubmed data... but I think we should hold off on that until we figure out  how to get these comparisons efficiently. [:+1:1] 
2018-03-11 14:39:29	Arun	I did check those scripts recently, but I will do go through it again today or tomorrow, to start looking into it. I will look at the compareMedSchools.py and see what we can we do it make it match better. 
2018-03-11 14:40:21	Arun	And yes, I will check with Janne too, and see if she is doing okay. 
2018-04-12 13:45:44	jesse	Hey Arun, in the meeting today, it seemed like you finished whatever you were doing, and the team wanted you to help me out with researching the Alternative Medicines. We don't really have any leads on that, just need to find out what sources are good for that and what we can scrape. 
2018-04-12 13:46:20	Arun	Hi Jesse, I was just about to ping you regarding the same  
2018-04-12 13:46:59	Arun	So, I need to look out for data on alternative medicines? 
2018-04-12 13:49:41	jesse	yep. do google searches, or whatever you can to build up a list of websites that we can scrape data from. 
2018-04-12 13:49:58	Arun	Yes, I can do that  
2018-04-12 13:51:01	jesse	I'll be doing the same thing, so let me know if you find anything, and I will let you know if I find anything. If we find something good enough to scrape, then we can focus on that, but for now, lets just get links. 
2018-04-12 15:08:33	Arun	Okaaay sure, sounds good  
2018-04-16 20:35:57	jesse	Hey Arun, have you been looking into alternative medicine resources? 
2018-04-17 03:47:28	Arun	Hey sorry Jesse, I was held up with my project work for the DevOps course and I am done with that just now. I will be working on it from today (Tuesday) evening  
2018-04-17 12:49:20	jesse	sorry I thought I responded to this. That's fine. I've found a few resources if you want me to give them to ya. However, I'm just trying to think about how we can turn that into something helpful to visitors of our websites, since terminology is very different in the herbal remedy world. 
2018-04-17 12:49:43	jesse	Best resources I have seen

2018-04-20 21:42:42	Arun	I forgot to send you these links earlier. 
2018-04-20 21:43:08	Arun	Anyway, is the next step to check if the data from this website is scrap-able? 
2018-04-20 21:45:43	jesse	yeah. not just if its scrapable, but can we actually make a connection from the disease to the treatment or the symptoms to the treatment. I was looking into some other sites but the biggest issue Im finding is that the medical vocabulary doesnt match up with the herbal community vocabulary. 
2018-04-20 22:22:06	Arun	Oh yeah, that is there too. 
2018-04-20 22:22:34	Arun	We can try to do a mapping between the medical vocab and the herbal community vocab? 
2018-04-21 10:24:16	jesse	if you think thats possible, then yeah. I dont think it is. 
2018-04-23 09:15:25	jesse	I just checked out the megabionet resource which looks amazing! the only issue is the vocab problem. I'm in the lab now, and I might ask someone about it. 
2018-04-24 10:13:45		getting channel history...
2018-02-16 19:48:50	jesse	Sounds good. 
2018-02-17 21:28:14	Arun	Hey Jesse, Will you be free post lunch tomorrow? 
2018-02-18 07:54:57	jesse	yeah 
2018-02-18 11:11:16	Arun	Great, shall we meet at 4pm today then? For about 1-2 hours maximum  
2018-02-18 11:20:23	jesse	Sounds good. I've been doing quite a bit of work to this script. for the most part, I just need to let you know what my current code gathers, the errors I'm running into, what needs to be done with the outputted CSV files, and stuff like that. My thinking is after we meet at 4, I can hand the rest of the work concerning pubmed stuff to you, and I can then switch to working on the drug company data and some of the other minor tasks. 
2018-02-18 14:38:33	Arun	Sure, I?ll be in Hunt grad commons. I?ve booked room number 4314  
2018-02-18 14:39:18	jesse	can undergrads go there? 
2018-02-18 14:40:01	Arun	Ah, I totally forgot about that! But I guess you can come inside if I'm with you 
2018-02-18 14:41:52	jesse	ok. are you there now or should i wait till 4? 
2018-02-18 14:42:16	Arun	I am here in library. We can meet now, sure! But the room is available only from 4 
2018-02-18 14:42:40	Arun	So, if you can find another room, I sure can come 
2018-02-18 14:46:44	jesse	I just checked. there is no room available that I can reserve.  
2018-02-18 14:47:03	Arun	Yeah, that's what I thought too! 
2018-02-18 14:47:29	Arun	Anyway, we can still meet now if you wish 
2018-02-18 14:52:32	jesse	sure. I'm just laying in my bed anyway. give me a few minutes to finish the current csv my computer is workin on and so I can make tea /get ready to leave 
2018-02-18 14:52:56	Arun	Yeah sure, take your time! :slightly_smiling_face: 
2018-02-18 15:03:18	jesse	im at the library now 
2018-02-18 15:03:46	Arun	Oh good. Can you come to 4th floor? I'll come near the lift 
2018-02-18 18:36:25	jesse	Did you specify in LibreOffice that the CSV's were comma separated when you opened it? 
2018-02-18 18:36:50	jesse	usually it says "separate by [] comma  [] semicolon [] space... etc 
2018-02-18 18:37:18	jesse	In the big CSV, I'm getting no entries that are overflowing. 
2018-02-18 18:39:05	jesse	Same with the little csv 
2018-02-18 18:40:22	Arun	Ah really? Damn, I didn?t notice that! But yeah, the next time I open it I?ll check that too 
2018-02-18 18:44:23	jesse	I'm gonna run the entire thing once more to try to locate the XML parsing error. hopefully I'll be able to narrow it down to a place and put a try/except thing around it to just skip the document if it fails to parse. 
2018-02-18 18:44:56	jesse	If you already have that stacktrace in your terminal, could you check the line number? 
2018-02-18 18:50:04	jesse	i think i'll just put an except around the search/query part. my guess is thats where the issue is. 
2018-02-18 18:58:01	Arun	Gimme sometime, I?ll check and let you know the line number  
2018-02-18 19:27:34	Arun	My new CSV is being generated now, and I cannot check back the stacktrace 
2018-02-18 19:27:51	jesse	thats ok. I've got a CSV generating myself. 
2018-02-18 19:28:38	jesse	quick trick: if you run "tmux" you can detach the terminal so that you can close out of the terminal and do other things while the program is being run in the background. [:+1:1 :heavy_check_mark:1] 
2018-02-18 21:16:47	jesse	I got the full csv and it's beautiful 
2018-02-18 21:17:20	jesse	i mean, its what you'd expect... a csv, but I've been working quite hard just to get it lol 
2018-02-18 21:23:57	jesse	also, I don't think I pulled your changes, since you removed the fun stuff like abstract and title 
2018-02-19 18:23:21	jesse	Hey Arun, you have yurika working on your computer right? 
2018-02-19 18:23:45	jesse	Janne was wanting to use it for getting info on drug companies. 
2018-02-19 20:40:41	Arun	Hey yeah, I have it in Running! Sorry, for the late reply  
2018-02-19 20:41:27	Arun	Janne wants to use it? Sure, we can try using it. But the websites that we use should allow crawling  
2018-02-19 20:42:18	jesse	cool. I'm not sure what Janne needs. I was working with her tonight and the drug company information is chaos. I'll try to ask Janne and get her to message 
2018-02-19 20:42:19	jesse	you 
2018-02-19 20:42:35	Arun	Or I can ping Janne right away and save some time :)  
2018-02-19 20:43:08	jesse	cool! I hope it works out. 
2018-02-19 20:43:22	Arun	Alright, pinged her now!  
2018-02-19 20:44:11	jesse	Thanks dude. i tried it on my computer but i think postgresql is forever broke on my computer from trying to mess with agensgraph 
2018-02-19 20:44:58	Arun	Ah, I see! Alright, not an issue! Let?s see if we are able to get the data using Yurika  
2018-02-26 12:51:32	Arun	Hey Jesse, I just realized that I have some work for today evening. Is it alright if we push today's meeting to tomorrow? 
2018-02-26 12:58:37	jesse	i guess that depends on everyone else. i could probably meet both today and tomorrow and not run out of things to do. 
2018-02-26 12:59:04	Arun	Okay, If others are making it, I'll try to make it too! 
2018-02-26 12:59:56	jesse	ok. if not, I can just let you know what happens, whether its by text or meeting up tomorrow. 
2018-02-26 13:00:39	Arun	Alright, that's great! I'll keep you posted :slightly_smiling_face: 
2018-02-27 09:06:59	jesse	Hey Arun, I met up with Sagar last night, and Janne separately. we've got a few issues with the pubmed stuff.
2018-02-27 09:06:59		I'll give ya a quick run down:
2018-02-27 09:06:59		our pubmed data filtered everyone who were affiliated with medical schools in NC
2018-02-27 09:06:59		our specialist data filtered everyone whos hospital was in NC.
2018-02-27 09:06:59		issue 1.   many people work in NC hospitals and have their medical degrees from places outside of NC.
2018-02-27 09:06:59		but lets ignore that for now.
2018-02-27 09:06:59		issue 2. the medical schools in the pubmed data is not uniform with the specialists data for schools they came from. matching UNC Chapel Hill would be fairly easy since Chapel Hill is unique... but take North Carolina State University... filter out the unnecessary words like "north carolina" and "university" and your left with ..."state"... which doesnt help. also consider that many pubmed researchers dont seem to be affiliated with a university or school of medicine... but rather just a lab...
2018-02-27 09:06:59		Back to Issue 1. If we want to fix this, we would be looking to scrape all of the pubmed data  rather than just NC (an estimated 300hr process with extra hours for filtering duplicates.)   alternatively, we could just  not filter the specialists at all but this comes with its own risks. (still preferable but it leads us back to issue 2.)
2018-02-27 09:06:59		As for Janne, she's been working hard scraping the drug company data. sadly a good amount of her work  must be done manually. 
2018-02-27 15:29:47	Arun	Hey Jesse, just seeing your message now. Thanks for the update! 
2018-02-27 15:31:00	Arun	Regarding issue 1, we can try to write a write to check if we are getting data properly, say upto 1000 or 10000 rows. Once we are sure about the script, we can request a machine to Meaghan and we can run our script in that machine, instead of running in our personal machine 
2018-02-27 15:42:01	jesse	that sounds reasonable, but it may be better if we could just download the entire pubmed data set rather than webscraping: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/databases/download/pubmed_medline.html
2018-02-27 15:42:01		I'm not sure if this would be too much memory or not, but they also have daily update files so we wouldn't have to re-download it every time... we would just need a way to convert the xml to postgresql... [:+1:1] 
2018-02-27 15:48:34	Arun	Oh yeah, I didnt know we could download the data directly. 
2018-02-27 15:49:28	Arun	Btw, for this week I am yet to clock in and start working on specialist-disease relation 
2018-02-27 15:49:48	jesse	ya wanna task? 
2018-02-27 15:50:02	Arun	I've been busy with my stuff. I guess I will be able to work a maximum of only 8-10 hours this week and next week 
2018-02-27 15:50:53	Arun	I will try writing the script to manipulate the name according to the pubmed data and see if I can find matches 
2018-02-27 15:51:03	Arun	Once I am done with that work, I can work on other task 
2018-02-27 15:51:28	jesse	hold on with that. 
2018-02-27 15:51:46	Arun	Are you sure about it? 
2018-02-27 15:52:01	Arun	I can hold on it and work on something more important if there is any 
2018-02-27 15:54:13	jesse	part of this past meeting was that since we cannot just match first and last name, since many first names are not full names... So we wanted to link them to their universities. So if a person with the last name of Hayes went to Chapel Hill in pubmed, we could say that they are the same person who is listed in specialists as Hayes who went to Chapel Hill. Do ya follow? 
2018-02-27 15:54:49	Arun	Okay, I get it. Yeah, it makes sense 
2018-02-27 15:56:05	jesse	Also, If we download the entire pubmed thing... and somehow make it into a pubmed database, we will need to modify whatever script you were planning on writing. 
2018-02-27 15:56:28	Arun	But, Is it the only way to confirm if two persons are the same? Is there other possibilities to confirm that. I was thinking something like, if the name is Mathew Hayes and we have M Hayes, chances that they both are same is quite high, whats your thought on that? 
2018-02-27 15:58:23	jesse	we could check firstname too... but ideally we would want M Hayes from Chapel Hill === Mathew Hayes from Chapel Hill... If we are opening up all of pubmed to all of the specialists in the united states... then first and last name is no longer accurate enough.. since there are a ton of mathew hayes from the united states whereas maybe not so much with just NC. 
2018-02-27 15:58:50	Arun	Yeah agreed! 
2018-02-27 16:00:22	Arun	But since there are way too many pubmed data and too many specialists too, the computation could take more time when we start comparing different fields simulatenously, I thought. 
2018-02-27 16:00:22		But nevertheless, what you said would definitely work :slightly_smiling_face: 
2018-02-27 16:04:28	jesse	it would take more time, but it would maybe be a couple hour process just from a rough estimate i think 
2018-02-27 16:04:46	jesse	I'll still need to confirm with Kowolenko before we actually try to do this [:+1:1] 
2018-02-27 16:25:19	Arun	Yeah thats right. And Okay, so meanwhile what do you want me to work on? 
2018-02-27 16:28:18	jesse	I think you should look into trying to find a way to compare the medical school names and see if the medical school names in the specialists match with the pubmed affiliations. 
2018-02-27 16:40:26	Arun	Okay, I will look at that today and let you know when I am done with it 
2018-02-27 16:41:25	jesse	xD I wouldn't expect you to be done with it. but let me know what your thinking about that problem. Also figured we should clarify that for the specialists, we are referring to the data from http://medicare.gov (medicare.gov) rather than the other specialist data we gathered. 
2018-02-27 16:43:07	Arun	Ahh, I see. Alright. I will look into that website and see what data we've got. And yeah, I will let you know my thoughts before I actually start coding it 
2018-02-27 16:46:31	jesse	https://data.medicare.gov/Physician-Compare/Physician-Compare-National-Downloadable-File/mj5m-pzi6

[:heavy_check_mark:1 :+1:1 :slightly_smiling_face:1] 
2018-02-27 20:13:11	jesse	Hey Arun, have you been working on that problem? ^^ 
2018-02-27 20:13:48	Arun	Not yet Jesse, I was planning to look at it tonight post dinner 
2018-02-27 20:14:50	jesse	ahh I gotcha. I was just wonderin. I'm trying to decide what I wanna do, whether it's eat dinner, work on this, or go back to my apartment and play a video game :stuck_out_tongue: 
2018-02-27 20:38:51	Arun	Haha, sometime  of video game wouldn't hurt anything I believe! :smile: 
2018-02-27 21:09:54	jesse	sadly I chose to work on another project :disappointed: 
2018-02-28 13:25:40	Arun	Hey Jesse, afternoon! So, I checked out the website and also the pubmed data. What you said makes sense. 
2018-02-28 13:25:40		And once we make all the necessary calculations, we could probably try to sort the list with current NC specialist coming on the top and then in the order of nearest states wrt NC 
2018-02-28 13:26:39	Arun	But we are expected to finish all this by next thursday? 
2018-02-28 13:29:05	jesse	did you read the messages on the rarediseases channel? 
2018-02-28 13:29:16	Arun	Yes I did 
2018-02-28 13:29:29	Arun	I just checked out the messages there 
2018-02-28 13:32:14	jesse	i gotcha. yeah we are supposed to have something to show off by next thursday. I'm thinking the only truly difficult task we will have to deal with is comparing the names of the medical schools.  If we have to download all of the pubmed data, we will have a lot more troubles, which is why I'm going to try to run the script without the NC filter and see if it takes significantly more time or not. 
2018-02-28 13:34:42	Arun	Okay that would be a start. Do you want us to meet anytime this week or weekend? I fear I won't be available next week starting Monday :disappointed: 
2018-02-28 13:35:34	jesse	I'm going to charlotte starting thursday night up until next sunday... I won't be able to meet. I can do google hangouts though... but thats not as helpful 
2018-02-28 13:37:12	Arun	Ah, I see. Alright then, we will figure it out. But let's split up the work and finish it off as much as possible. 
2018-02-28 13:38:05	Arun	One question, why do you want to strip out the University names? Like, you were saying NC State University will result in 'state' which is not of any use. But, why do we have to it? 
2018-02-28 13:44:01	jesse	agreed. I'll have more information tonight... so it'll be clearer what all we need to do by the meeting time tomorrow. No matter what though, we need to find a way to compare the University names.
2018-02-28 13:44:01		As for that, the names of the affiliations in the pubmed data are not the same as the medical schools in the specialists data. We need to find a way to connect people on first/lastname (easy) and then by the university... my thought was that we could strip away some of the meaningless words so that we could match the names of the schools... but that won't work for the above reason you mentioned. Ingrams aren't too great either since swapping North Carolina State University also could match University of North Carolina State.
2018-02-28 13:44:01		Don't get too fixated on things that I say. I'm just trying to get you to understand the problem.  If you can find a way to keep all of the words in and determine that two schools are the same, all power to ya. 
2018-02-28 13:47:57	Arun	Haha, agreed. I understand you are trying to explain me the problem. :slightly_smiling_face: 
2018-02-28 13:50:23	Arun	And alright, meanwhile, let me know if you need anything! 
2018-02-28 13:50:40	jesse	Sure thing. 
2018-03-01 14:03:57	jesse	I posted the notes/todo thing I made for the week. take a look at that and then you can ask me if you have any questions. 
2018-03-01 20:16:16	Arun	Hey, I just had a look at it now. 
2018-03-01 20:19:33	Arun	I see there are immediate stuffs to get done with regard to matching physicians with pubmed data. Will you be working on any task particularly? 
2018-03-01 21:17:22	jesse	i havent decided the order Ill start tackling these things yet. sorry i didnt respond. i was driving 
2018-03-01 21:18:27	Arun	No worries! :slightly_smiling_face: And, let me know how we can go about it, if you got any leads 
2018-03-04 01:18:58	Arun	Hey, so for comparing the affiliation from pubmed and physician's medical school name, we can probably just check if medical school name is present in pubmed affiliation. 
2018-03-04 01:18:58		For example, as far as I noticed, the Physician's medical school name is pretty organised, but pubmed affiliations seem to have lot of redundant names.
2018-03-04 01:18:58		In this method, we can convert the physician's medical school name to an array and check if all the elements of the array is in pubmed affiliation. If so, we can assure that they both are the same person. 
2018-03-04 01:18:58		What do you think about this? 
2018-03-04 01:22:05	Arun	And for us to match physicians data from pubmed and physician data, the fastest method would be to put it in a DB and then querying it. 
2018-03-04 09:12:58	jesse	Hey Arun, I agree that the pubmed data is scattered and that the physician data is more organized and condensed. however, I dont think it will be enough to just check if the physician med school is in the affiliation.
2018-03-04 09:12:58		Have you taken a look at certain schools that would and would not match under this scenario? If you have, and you are comfortable with the results that gives, then sure... but im thinking we may need to worry about ngrams and abbreviations.
2018-03-04 09:12:58		Ive been trying to compile a list of all schools contained in the pubmed data and sort them, but it's been running for twelve hours and I dont think itll finish. maybe i should try a much smaller dataset.. 
2018-03-04 09:18:25	jesse	I've got a list  of the affiliations that came from diseases beginning with X-Z 
2018-03-04 09:19:24	jesse	maybe we can use that and the list of med schools from the physician data to help us determine a good matching system. 
2018-03-04 09:30:50	jesse	I also had Sagar working a lil bit on this. I gave him a list of 400 med school names that came from the physician data and had him make abbreviations for each one. (i hope he wrote a program to do this lol) 
2018-03-04 12:00:15	Arun	Right, and for matching two med school names, I can probably write a script that would take care of abbreviations too. It will be very similar to the script I wrote for comparing names in any order 
2018-03-04 12:06:22	jesse	ok. if you can, try to make it so that we arent loading the entire CSVs into the script.
2018-03-04 12:06:22		many of these files are gigabytes of text, so we will run out of memory if we do that. 
2018-03-04 12:15:54	Arun	Right, well I?m sure of how to do that part. Like, I can read from the CSV and for each line in the CSV, I will have to read from the physician?s CSV. But, in this way, for each ?row? in the pubmed, I will be reading all the rows from the physician CSV, every time. 
2018-03-04 12:15:54		Is there any other way that you know of? 
2018-03-04 12:16:11	Arun	I mean, I?m *not sure of how to do that part 
2018-03-04 12:30:35	jesse	I'm not sure either. 
2018-03-04 12:39:42	jesse	I'm gonna try to filter out the duplicates out of the pubmed data once again and see what the file size is. 
2018-03-04 12:56:03	jesse	Are you working on raredx stuff right now? 
2018-03-04 12:58:02	Arun	I'm guessing the best way to go forward would be to put it on a DB and query data. 
2018-03-04 12:58:52	Arun	Anyway, I am not working on it right now. 
2018-03-04 13:07:09	jesse	put what specifically on the db? 
2018-03-04 13:07:34	Arun	Both, the pubmed data and the physician data. Instead of having it on a CSV 
2018-03-04 13:09:25	Arun	Do you believe our searching would be faster that way? 
2018-03-04 13:15:59	jesse	I'm not sure it would matter. once pandas loads it into memory, it doesn't matter. if you were thinking of doing some sort of join statement or some python thing that worked directly with psql, then it would be faster. 
2018-03-04 15:08:59	Arun	Yeah, thats true too, alright then 
2018-03-04 20:08:59	jesse	arun, do you have a script for the medschool comparison? 
2018-03-04 21:03:00	Arun	Hey, I will send you in sometime, like half hour? I am on my way home now from outside 
2018-03-04 21:03:51	jesse	sounds good 
2018-03-04 22:23:18	Arun	Hi Jesse :slightly_smiling_face: 
2018-03-04 22:24:51	Arun	Can I send the script here? 
2018-03-04 22:27:56	Arun	@Arun uploaded a file: https://ncstateuniversityitng.slack.com/files/U95TJ10M9/F9JFZ3Z45/comparemednames.py (compareMedNames.py) and commented: Script that compares Medical School Names from pubmed data and physcian data 
2018-03-04 22:30:22	Arun	I ran this script by taking names manually form the pubmed csv and the physician data. And it worked fine for the names I used. 
2018-03-04 22:31:42	Arun	I wouldn't say this script works very fine.  There will definitely be some good amount of false positive. But since we are already comparing the names, and this is more like a second factor to affirm our decision if two persons are the same, I'm hoping this would work fine. 
2018-03-04 22:36:20	Arun	@Arun uploaded a file: https://ncstateuniversityitng.slack.com/files/U95TJ10M9/F9JBS09T6/pip_package_for_fuzzywuzzy.txt (pip package for fuzzywuzzy) and commented: Forgot to mention, you need to install the fuzzywuzzy package for this. 
2018-03-04 23:04:26	jesse	I'll take a look tomorrow. i appreciate it dude. i tried to run a script tonight but my computer froze again.... these files are just too big :( 
2018-03-05 00:21:37	Arun	Ah, I see. Yeah please run it tomorrow and let me know how it runs against our data. :slightly_smiling_face: Thanks Jesse 
2018-03-05 00:21:58	Arun	And also, do you want my script for name comparison as well? 
2018-03-05 07:13:07	jesse	yes plz. anything would help. 
2018-03-05 10:25:10	Arun	Okay, I will slightly modify whatever I?ve coded and send you in sometime. 
2018-03-05 10:25:10		I?m not working on it right now, but I?ll send you! Is that okay? 
2018-03-05 10:25:36	jesse	yeah. 
2018-03-05 10:25:40	jesse	Thanks 
2018-03-05 16:44:45	Arun	@Arun uploaded a file: https://ncstateuniversityitng.slack.com/files/U95TJ10M9/F9JBZ2HND/comparenames.py (compareNames.py) 
2018-03-06 14:54:17	Arun	Hey Jesse, I am so sorry, I have an important interview this Thursday and thus I am unable to work on it, as I have to prepare myself for the interview. I hope you understand and its alright. I will be back only by Thursday night. 
2018-03-06 14:56:03	jesse	yeah I got you. just means more money for me :stuck_out_tongue: 
2018-03-06 14:56:44	jesse	I might get Michael or meaghan to help code some of this up too. xD 
2018-03-08 18:51:24	Arun	Hi Jesse. 
2018-03-08 18:51:30	Arun	How you doing? 
2018-03-08 18:51:57	Arun	Is there anything that you want me to work on? I can work on it tomorrow 
2018-03-08 19:34:53	jesse	hey dude. ya know that list, YetAnotherMedicalSchoolList? 
2018-03-08 19:41:28	jesse	I would like the medical schools, all 404 of them  to have which state that they came from. This will be a big help with the comparisons.
2018-03-08 19:41:28		right now, I only have a program that gets the NC comparisons. this was done for the sake of efficiency... the program as it is takes 30 mins to run. with all 50 states, its gonna take 24 hours if we generate sql statements for all of them.... this is still far better than the estimated 600 days that a nested for loop would cause. 
2018-03-08 19:42:18	jesse	and I'm doing alright. i needed to run the pubmed data once more which kinda sucks. 
2018-03-09 02:45:49	Arun	YetAnotherMedicalSchoolList? I am not aware of that list 
2018-03-09 03:11:18	Arun	Oh, we have created all the databases now? 
2018-03-09 08:01:13	jesse	oh sorry i mustve spoken to sagar about that one 
2018-03-09 08:02:08	jesse	we dont have all the databases now since i got one generating right now. its the pubmed junk again. 
2018-03-09 08:03:20	jesse	YetAnotherMedicalSchoolList is something where I took all of the specialists medical schools and filtered out all the duplicates. its in the google drive 
2018-03-09 08:04:01	jesse	there were a few different lists of medical schools at this point, so thats what I decided to call it. 
2018-03-09 08:12:22	jesse	I've also got a program for checking for matches in the med schools. we need that program to match as many as possible without doing something complex like n grams... i think. if we do the ngrams, our program will take forever to run... although it may be feasible for just NC. 
2018-03-09 08:13:02	jesse	if you'd like to try to upgrade that program, feel free. 
2018-03-09 08:18:48	jesse	if you want to see those 2 programs, theyre in power6a under/home/jlsimps4/ForTheGreatAndPowerfulMichael/
2018-03-09 08:18:48		since michael was wanting to look into them.
2018-03-09 08:18:48		they require a database for the specialists and the pubmed stuff, so you can find those csvs in the ForMeaghan folder... to convert between the two, you can just use a psql \copy statement 
2018-03-09 19:23:01	Arun	Hey Jesse, I?m just checking out your messages. So comparing med schools, you have written a separate script? 
2018-03-09 19:24:02	Arun	And, you took the YetAnotherMedicalSchoolList from the already available specialist data ( that website you sent me previously) , I believe? 
2018-03-09 19:34:00	jesse	yep. the scripts are in the pubmed-crawler folder in the rarediseases repo 
2018-03-09 19:35:33	Arun	Okay I will look into it!  
2018-03-09 19:36:58	Arun	So, you want me to do which state does these universities/medical school come from eh?  
2018-03-09 19:38:46	jesse	yeah. preferably the two letter code. NC for north carolina. I asked sagar to look at the same thing so you may want to message him. And maybe put messages in the patientportalpeeps channel since I've had to repeat myself for both you and Sagar. 
2018-03-10 15:18:08	Arun	Alright I will talk to Sagar and check where he is 
2018-03-10 21:39:13	Arun	Hey. I checked with Sagar, he said he is good with doing that part. So, is there something else I could work on?  
2018-03-10 21:40:53	jesse	have you seen the script for the medschool comparisons ? 
2018-03-10 21:51:09	jesse	There are 2, getPhysicianPubmedConnection.py and compareMedSchools.py
2018-03-10 21:51:09		We are no longer deleting the duplicates from the pubmed dataset because we are keeping the disease ids with the articles... What this means is that it will take longer for the program  to run. We need to make it more efficient if possible.
2018-03-10 21:51:09		As for the second file, we need to do whatever we can to get more medical schools to match... this could be achieved by doing Ngrams or by removing more nonsense words. 
2018-03-10 21:51:09		and last of all, you can check if Janne needs help with the drug companies. I havent heard back from her.
2018-03-10 21:51:09		That is all I would know to do. There are also some issues you could look into on github. 
2018-03-10 21:55:19	jesse	Also stuff about Mesh terms when gathering the pubmed data... but I think we should hold off on that until we figure out  how to get these comparisons efficiently. [:+1:1] 
2018-03-11 14:39:29	Arun	I did check those scripts recently, but I will do go through it again today or tomorrow, to start looking into it. I will look at the compareMedSchools.py and see what we can we do it make it match better. 
2018-03-11 14:40:21	Arun	And yes, I will check with Janne too, and see if she is doing okay. 
2018-04-12 13:45:44	jesse	Hey Arun, in the meeting today, it seemed like you finished whatever you were doing, and the team wanted you to help me out with researching the Alternative Medicines. We don't really have any leads on that, just need to find out what sources are good for that and what we can scrape. 
2018-04-12 13:46:20	Arun	Hi Jesse, I was just about to ping you regarding the same  
2018-04-12 13:46:59	Arun	So, I need to look out for data on alternative medicines? 
2018-04-12 13:49:41	jesse	yep. do google searches, or whatever you can to build up a list of websites that we can scrape data from. 
2018-04-12 13:49:58	Arun	Yes, I can do that  
2018-04-12 13:51:01	jesse	I'll be doing the same thing, so let me know if you find anything, and I will let you know if I find anything. If we find something good enough to scrape, then we can focus on that, but for now, lets just get links. 
2018-04-12 15:08:33	Arun	Okaaay sure, sounds good  
2018-04-16 20:35:57	jesse	Hey Arun, have you been looking into alternative medicine resources? 
2018-04-17 03:47:28	Arun	Hey sorry Jesse, I was held up with my project work for the DevOps course and I am done with that just now. I will be working on it from today (Tuesday) evening  
2018-04-17 12:49:20	jesse	sorry I thought I responded to this. That's fine. I've found a few resources if you want me to give them to ya. However, I'm just trying to think about how we can turn that into something helpful to visitors of our websites, since terminology is very different in the herbal remedy world. 
2018-04-17 12:49:43	jesse	Best resources I have seen

2018-04-20 21:43:08	Arun	Anyway, is the next step to check if the data from this website is scrap-able? 
2018-04-20 21:45:43	jesse	yeah. not just if its scrapable, but can we actually make a connection from the disease to the treatment or the symptoms to the treatment. I was looking into some other sites but the biggest issue Im finding is that the medical vocabulary doesnt match up with the herbal community vocabulary. 
2018-04-20 22:22:06	Arun	Oh yeah, that is there too. 
2018-04-20 22:22:34	Arun	We can try to do a mapping between the medical vocab and the herbal community vocab? 
2018-04-21 10:24:16	jesse	if you think thats possible, then yeah. I dont think it is. 
2018-04-23 09:15:25	jesse	I just checked out the megabionet resource which looks amazing! the only issue is the vocab problem. I'm in the lab now, and I might ask someone about it. 
2018-04-23 12:07:08	Arun	Megabionet? Can you share the link of it? I?ll just take a look at it  
2018-04-23 12:07:31	jesse	you linked it earlier. 
2018-04-23 12:08:17	Arun	Oh lol, sorry I didn?t remember the name of the links I sent you. Anyway, alright.  
2018-04-26 08:59:13		getting channel history...
2018-02-18 07:54:57	jesse	yeah 
2018-02-18 11:11:16	Arun	Great, shall we meet at 4pm today then? For about 1-2 hours maximum  
2018-02-18 11:20:23	jesse	Sounds good. I've been doing quite a bit of work to this script. for the most part, I just need to let you know what my current code gathers, the errors I'm running into, what needs to be done with the outputted CSV files, and stuff like that. My thinking is after we meet at 4, I can hand the rest of the work concerning pubmed stuff to you, and I can then switch to working on the drug company data and some of the other minor tasks. 
2018-02-18 14:38:33	Arun	Sure, I’ll be in Hunt grad commons. I’ve booked room number 4314  
2018-02-18 14:39:18	jesse	can undergrads go there? 
2018-02-18 14:40:01	Arun	Ah, I totally forgot about that! But I guess you can come inside if I'm with you 
2018-02-18 14:41:52	jesse	ok. are you there now or should i wait till 4? 
2018-02-18 14:42:16	Arun	I am here in library. We can meet now, sure! But the room is available only from 4 
2018-02-18 14:42:40	Arun	So, if you can find another room, I sure can come 
2018-02-18 14:46:44	jesse	I just checked. there is no room available that I can reserve.  
2018-02-18 14:47:03	Arun	Yeah, that's what I thought too! 
2018-02-18 14:47:29	Arun	Anyway, we can still meet now if you wish 
2018-02-18 14:52:32	jesse	sure. I'm just laying in my bed anyway. give me a few minutes to finish the current csv my computer is workin on and so I can make tea /get ready to leave 
2018-02-18 14:52:56	Arun	Yeah sure, take your time! :slightly_smiling_face: 
2018-02-18 15:03:18	jesse	im at the library now 
2018-02-18 15:03:46	Arun	Oh good. Can you come to 4th floor? I'll come near the lift 
2018-02-18 18:36:25	jesse	Did you specify in LibreOffice that the CSV's were comma separated when you opened it? 
2018-02-18 18:36:50	jesse	usually it says "separate by [] comma  [] semicolon [] space... etc 
2018-02-18 18:37:18	jesse	In the big CSV, I'm getting no entries that are overflowing. 
2018-02-18 18:39:05	jesse	Same with the little csv 
2018-02-18 18:40:22	Arun	Ah really? Damn, I didn’t notice that! But yeah, the next time I open it I’ll check that too 
2018-02-18 18:44:23	jesse	I'm gonna run the entire thing once more to try to locate the XML parsing error. hopefully I'll be able to narrow it down to a place and put a try/except thing around it to just skip the document if it fails to parse. 
2018-02-18 18:44:56	jesse	If you already have that stacktrace in your terminal, could you check the line number? 
2018-02-18 18:50:04	jesse	i think i'll just put an except around the search/query part. my guess is thats where the issue is. 
2018-02-18 18:58:01	Arun	Gimme sometime, I’ll check and let you know the line number  
2018-02-18 19:27:34	Arun	My new CSV is being generated now, and I cannot check back the stacktrace 
2018-02-18 19:27:51	jesse	thats ok. I've got a CSV generating myself. 
2018-02-18 19:28:38	jesse	quick trick: if you run "tmux" you can detach the terminal so that you can close out of the terminal and do other things while the program is being run in the background. [:+1:1 :heavy_check_mark:1] 
2018-02-18 21:16:47	jesse	I got the full csv and it's beautiful 
2018-02-18 21:17:20	jesse	i mean, its what you'd expect... a csv, but I've been working quite hard just to get it lol 
2018-02-18 21:23:57	jesse	also, I don't think I pulled your changes, since you removed the fun stuff like abstract and title 
2018-02-19 18:23:21	jesse	Hey Arun, you have yurika working on your computer right? 
2018-02-19 18:23:45	jesse	Janne was wanting to use it for getting info on drug companies. 
2018-02-19 20:40:41	Arun	Hey yeah, I have it in Running! Sorry, for the late reply  
2018-02-19 20:41:27	Arun	Janne wants to use it? Sure, we can try using it. But the websites that we use should allow crawling  
2018-02-19 20:42:18	jesse	cool. I'm not sure what Janne needs. I was working with her tonight and the drug company information is chaos. I'll try to ask Janne and get her to message 
2018-02-19 20:42:19	jesse	you 
2018-02-19 20:42:35	Arun	Or I can ping Janne right away and save some time :)  
2018-02-19 20:43:08	jesse	cool! I hope it works out. 
2018-02-19 20:43:22	Arun	Alright, pinged her now!  
2018-02-19 20:44:11	jesse	Thanks dude. i tried it on my computer but i think postgresql is forever broke on my computer from trying to mess with agensgraph 
2018-02-19 20:44:58	Arun	Ah, I see! Alright, not an issue! Let’s see if we are able to get the data using Yurika  
2018-02-26 12:51:32	Arun	Hey Jesse, I just realized that I have some work for today evening. Is it alright if we push today's meeting to tomorrow? 
2018-02-26 12:58:37	jesse	i guess that depends on everyone else. i could probably meet both today and tomorrow and not run out of things to do. 
2018-02-26 12:59:04	Arun	Okay, If others are making it, I'll try to make it too! 
2018-02-26 12:59:56	jesse	ok. if not, I can just let you know what happens, whether its by text or meeting up tomorrow. 
2018-02-26 13:00:39	Arun	Alright, that's great! I'll keep you posted :slightly_smiling_face: 
2018-02-27 09:06:59	jesse	Hey Arun, I met up with Sagar last night, and Janne separately. we've got a few issues with the pubmed stuff.
2018-02-27 09:06:59		I'll give ya a quick run down:
2018-02-27 09:06:59		our pubmed data filtered everyone who were affiliated with medical schools in NC
2018-02-27 09:06:59		our specialist data filtered everyone whos hospital was in NC.
2018-02-27 09:06:59		issue 1.   many people work in NC hospitals and have their medical degrees from places outside of NC.
2018-02-27 09:06:59		but lets ignore that for now.
2018-02-27 09:06:59		issue 2. the medical schools in the pubmed data is not uniform with the specialists data for schools they came from. matching UNC Chapel Hill would be fairly easy since Chapel Hill is unique... but take North Carolina State University... filter out the unnecessary words like "north carolina" and "university" and your left with ..."state"... which doesnt help. also consider that many pubmed researchers dont seem to be affiliated with a university or school of medicine... but rather just a lab...
2018-02-27 09:06:59		Back to Issue 1. If we want to fix this, we would be looking to scrape all of the pubmed data  rather than just NC (an estimated 300hr process with extra hours for filtering duplicates.)   alternatively, we could just  not filter the specialists at all but this comes with its own risks. (still preferable but it leads us back to issue 2.)
2018-02-27 09:06:59		As for Janne, she's been working hard scraping the drug company data. sadly a good amount of her work  must be done manually. 
2018-02-27 15:29:47	Arun	Hey Jesse, just seeing your message now. Thanks for the update! 
2018-02-27 15:31:00	Arun	Regarding issue 1, we can try to write a write to check if we are getting data properly, say upto 1000 or 10000 rows. Once we are sure about the script, we can request a machine to Meaghan and we can run our script in that machine, instead of running in our personal machine 
2018-02-27 15:42:01	jesse	that sounds reasonable, but it may be better if we could just download the entire pubmed data set rather than webscraping: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/databases/download/pubmed_medline.html
2018-02-27 15:42:01		I'm not sure if this would be too much memory or not, but they also have daily update files so we wouldn't have to re-download it every time... we would just need a way to convert the xml to postgresql... [:+1:1] 
2018-02-27 15:48:34	Arun	Oh yeah, I didnt know we could download the data directly. 
2018-02-27 15:49:28	Arun	Btw, for this week I am yet to clock in and start working on specialist-disease relation 
2018-02-27 15:49:48	jesse	ya wanna task? 
2018-02-27 15:50:02	Arun	I've been busy with my stuff. I guess I will be able to work a maximum of only 8-10 hours this week and next week 
2018-02-27 15:50:53	Arun	I will try writing the script to manipulate the name according to the pubmed data and see if I can find matches 
2018-02-27 15:51:03	Arun	Once I am done with that work, I can work on other task 
2018-02-27 15:51:28	jesse	hold on with that. 
2018-02-27 15:51:46	Arun	Are you sure about it? 
2018-02-27 15:52:01	Arun	I can hold on it and work on something more important if there is any 
2018-02-27 15:54:13	jesse	part of this past meeting was that since we cannot just match first and last name, since many first names are not full names... So we wanted to link them to their universities. So if a person with the last name of Hayes went to Chapel Hill in pubmed, we could say that they are the same person who is listed in specialists as Hayes who went to Chapel Hill. Do ya follow? 
2018-02-27 15:54:49	Arun	Okay, I get it. Yeah, it makes sense 
2018-02-27 15:56:05	jesse	Also, If we download the entire pubmed thing... and somehow make it into a pubmed database, we will need to modify whatever script you were planning on writing. 
2018-02-27 15:56:28	Arun	But, Is it the only way to confirm if two persons are the same? Is there other possibilities to confirm that. I was thinking something like, if the name is Mathew Hayes and we have M Hayes, chances that they both are same is quite high, whats your thought on that? 
2018-02-27 15:58:23	jesse	we could check firstname too... but ideally we would want M Hayes from Chapel Hill === Mathew Hayes from Chapel Hill... If we are opening up all of pubmed to all of the specialists in the united states... then first and last name is no longer accurate enough.. since there are a ton of mathew hayes from the united states whereas maybe not so much with just NC. 
2018-02-27 15:58:50	Arun	Yeah agreed! 
2018-02-27 16:00:22	Arun	But since there are way too many pubmed data and too many specialists too, the computation could take more time when we start comparing different fields simulatenously, I thought. 
2018-02-27 16:00:22		But nevertheless, what you said would definitely work :slightly_smiling_face: 
2018-02-27 16:04:28	jesse	it would take more time, but it would maybe be a couple hour process just from a rough estimate i think 
2018-02-27 16:04:46	jesse	I'll still need to confirm with Kowolenko before we actually try to do this [:+1:1] 
2018-02-27 16:25:19	Arun	Yeah thats right. And Okay, so meanwhile what do you want me to work on? 
2018-02-27 16:28:18	jesse	I think you should look into trying to find a way to compare the medical school names and see if the medical school names in the specialists match with the pubmed affiliations. 
2018-02-27 16:40:26	Arun	Okay, I will look at that today and let you know when I am done with it 
2018-02-27 16:41:25	jesse	xD I wouldn't expect you to be done with it. but let me know what your thinking about that problem. Also figured we should clarify that for the specialists, we are referring to the data from http://medicare.gov (medicare.gov) rather than the other specialist data we gathered. 
2018-02-27 16:43:07	Arun	Ahh, I see. Alright. I will look into that website and see what data we've got. And yeah, I will let you know my thoughts before I actually start coding it 
2018-02-27 16:46:31	jesse	https://data.medicare.gov/Physician-Compare/Physician-Compare-National-Downloadable-File/mj5m-pzi6
2018-02-27 16:46:31		Physician Compare National Downloadable File | Data.Medicare.gov
2018-02-27 16:46:31		Physician Compare National Downloadable File - The Physician Compare National Downloadable File is organized at the individual eligible professional level; each line is unique at the professional/enrollment record/Group Practice/address level. Professionals with multiple Medicare enrollment records and/or single enrollments linking to multiple practice location addresses are listed on multiple lines. [:heavy_check_mark:1 :+1:1 :slightly_smiling_face:1] 
2018-02-27 20:13:11	jesse	Hey Arun, have you been working on that problem? ^^ 
2018-02-27 20:13:48	Arun	Not yet Jesse, I was planning to look at it tonight post dinner 
2018-02-27 20:14:50	jesse	ahh I gotcha. I was just wonderin. I'm trying to decide what I wanna do, whether it's eat dinner, work on this, or go back to my apartment and play a video game :stuck_out_tongue: 
2018-02-27 20:38:51	Arun	Haha, sometime  of video game wouldn't hurt anything I believe! :smile: 
2018-02-27 21:09:54	jesse	sadly I chose to work on another project :disappointed: 
2018-02-28 13:25:40	Arun	Hey Jesse, afternoon! So, I checked out the website and also the pubmed data. What you said makes sense. 
2018-02-28 13:25:40		And once we make all the necessary calculations, we could probably try to sort the list with current NC specialist coming on the top and then in the order of nearest states wrt NC 
2018-02-28 13:26:39	Arun	But we are expected to finish all this by next thursday? 
2018-02-28 13:29:05	jesse	did you read the messages on the rarediseases channel? 
2018-02-28 13:29:16	Arun	Yes I did 
2018-02-28 13:29:29	Arun	I just checked out the messages there 
2018-02-28 13:32:14	jesse	i gotcha. yeah we are supposed to have something to show off by next thursday. I'm thinking the only truly difficult task we will have to deal with is comparing the names of the medical schools.  If we have to download all of the pubmed data, we will have a lot more troubles, which is why I'm going to try to run the script without the NC filter and see if it takes significantly more time or not. 
2018-02-28 13:34:42	Arun	Okay that would be a start. Do you want us to meet anytime this week or weekend? I fear I won't be available next week starting Monday :disappointed: 
2018-02-28 13:35:34	jesse	I'm going to charlotte starting thursday night up until next sunday... I won't be able to meet. I can do google hangouts though... but thats not as helpful 
2018-02-28 13:37:12	Arun	Ah, I see. Alright then, we will figure it out. But let's split up the work and finish it off as much as possible. 
2018-02-28 13:38:05	Arun	One question, why do you want to strip out the University names? Like, you were saying NC State University will result in 'state' which is not of any use. But, why do we have to it? 
2018-02-28 13:44:01	jesse	agreed. I'll have more information tonight... so it'll be clearer what all we need to do by the meeting time tomorrow. No matter what though, we need to find a way to compare the University names.
2018-02-28 13:44:01		As for that, the names of the affiliations in the pubmed data are not the same as the medical schools in the specialists data. We need to find a way to connect people on first/lastname (easy) and then by the university... my thought was that we could strip away some of the meaningless words so that we could match the names of the schools... but that won't work for the above reason you mentioned. Ingrams aren't too great either since swapping North Carolina State University also could match University of North Carolina State.
2018-02-28 13:44:01		Don't get too fixated on things that I say. I'm just trying to get you to understand the problem.  If you can find a way to keep all of the words in and determine that two schools are the same, all power to ya. 
2018-02-28 13:47:57	Arun	Haha, agreed. I understand you are trying to explain me the problem. :slightly_smiling_face: 
2018-02-28 13:50:23	Arun	And alright, meanwhile, let me know if you need anything! 
2018-02-28 13:50:40	jesse	Sure thing. 
2018-03-01 14:03:57	jesse	I posted the notes/todo thing I made for the week. take a look at that and then you can ask me if you have any questions. 
2018-03-01 20:16:16	Arun	Hey, I just had a look at it now. 
2018-03-01 20:19:33	Arun	I see there are immediate stuffs to get done with regard to matching physicians with pubmed data. Will you be working on any task particularly? 
2018-03-01 21:17:22	jesse	i havent decided the order Ill start tackling these things yet. sorry i didnt respond. i was driving 
2018-03-01 21:18:27	Arun	No worries! :slightly_smiling_face: And, let me know how we can go about it, if you got any leads 
2018-03-04 01:18:58	Arun	Hey, so for comparing the affiliation from pubmed and physician's medical school name, we can probably just check if medical school name is present in pubmed affiliation. 
2018-03-04 01:18:58		For example, as far as I noticed, the Physician's medical school name is pretty organised, but pubmed affiliations seem to have lot of redundant names.
2018-03-04 01:18:58		In this method, we can convert the physician's medical school name to an array and check if all the elements of the array is in pubmed affiliation. If so, we can assure that they both are the same person. 
2018-03-04 01:18:58		What do you think about this? 
2018-03-04 01:22:05	Arun	And for us to match physicians data from pubmed and physician data, the fastest method would be to put it in a DB and then querying it. 
2018-03-04 09:12:58	jesse	Hey Arun, I agree that the pubmed data is scattered and that the physician data is more organized and condensed. however, I dont think it will be enough to just check if the physician med school is in the affiliation.
2018-03-04 09:12:58		Have you taken a look at certain schools that would and would not match under this scenario? If you have, and you are comfortable with the results that gives, then sure... but im thinking we may need to worry about ngrams and abbreviations.
2018-03-04 09:12:58		Ive been trying to compile a list of all schools contained in the pubmed data and sort them, but it's been running for twelve hours and I dont think itll finish. maybe i should try a much smaller dataset.. 
2018-03-04 09:18:25	jesse	I've got a list  of the affiliations that came from diseases beginning with X-Z 
2018-03-04 09:19:24	jesse	maybe we can use that and the list of med schools from the physician data to help us determine a good matching system. 
2018-03-04 09:30:50	jesse	I also had Sagar working a lil bit on this. I gave him a list of 400 med school names that came from the physician data and had him make abbreviations for each one. (i hope he wrote a program to do this lol) 
2018-03-04 12:00:15	Arun	Right, and for matching two med school names, I can probably write a script that would take care of abbreviations too. It will be very similar to the script I wrote for comparing names in any order 
2018-03-04 12:06:22	jesse	ok. if you can, try to make it so that we arent loading the entire CSVs into the script.
2018-03-04 12:06:22		many of these files are gigabytes of text, so we will run out of memory if we do that. 
2018-03-04 12:15:54	Arun	Right, well I’m sure of how to do that part. Like, I can read from the CSV and for each line in the CSV, I will have to read from the physician’s CSV. But, in this way, for each ‘row’ in the pubmed, I will be reading all the rows from the physician CSV, every time. 
2018-03-04 12:15:54		Is there any other way that you know of? 
2018-03-04 12:16:11	Arun	I mean, I’m *not sure of how to do that part 
2018-03-04 12:30:35	jesse	I'm not sure either. 
2018-03-04 12:39:42	jesse	I'm gonna try to filter out the duplicates out of the pubmed data once again and see what the file size is. 
2018-03-04 12:56:03	jesse	Are you working on raredx stuff right now? 
2018-03-04 12:58:02	Arun	I'm guessing the best way to go forward would be to put it on a DB and query data. 
2018-03-04 12:58:52	Arun	Anyway, I am not working on it right now. 
2018-03-04 13:07:09	jesse	put what specifically on the db? 
2018-03-04 13:07:34	Arun	Both, the pubmed data and the physician data. Instead of having it on a CSV 
2018-03-04 13:09:25	Arun	Do you believe our searching would be faster that way? 
2018-03-04 13:15:59	jesse	I'm not sure it would matter. once pandas loads it into memory, it doesn't matter. if you were thinking of doing some sort of join statement or some python thing that worked directly with psql, then it would be faster. 
2018-03-04 15:08:59	Arun	Yeah, thats true too, alright then 
2018-03-04 20:08:59	jesse	arun, do you have a script for the medschool comparison? 
2018-03-04 21:03:00	Arun	Hey, I will send you in sometime, like half hour? I am on my way home now from outside 
2018-03-04 21:03:51	jesse	sounds good 
2018-03-04 22:23:18	Arun	Hi Jesse :slightly_smiling_face: 
2018-03-04 22:24:51	Arun	Can I send the script here? 
2018-03-04 22:27:56	Arun	@Arun uploaded a file: https://ncstateuniversityitng.slack.com/files/U95TJ10M9/F9JFZ3Z45/comparemednames.py (compareMedNames.py) and commented: Script that compares Medical School Names from pubmed data and physcian data 
2018-03-04 22:30:22	Arun	I ran this script by taking names manually form the pubmed csv and the physician data. And it worked fine for the names I used. 
2018-03-04 22:31:42	Arun	I wouldn't say this script works very fine.  There will definitely be some good amount of false positive. But since we are already comparing the names, and this is more like a second factor to affirm our decision if two persons are the same, I'm hoping this would work fine. 
2018-03-04 22:36:20	Arun	@Arun uploaded a file: https://ncstateuniversityitng.slack.com/files/U95TJ10M9/F9JBS09T6/pip_package_for_fuzzywuzzy.txt (pip package for fuzzywuzzy) and commented: Forgot to mention, you need to install the fuzzywuzzy package for this. 
2018-03-04 23:04:26	jesse	I'll take a look tomorrow. i appreciate it dude. i tried to run a script tonight but my computer froze again.... these files are just too big :( 
2018-03-05 00:21:37	Arun	Ah, I see. Yeah please run it tomorrow and let me know how it runs against our data. :slightly_smiling_face: Thanks Jesse 
2018-03-05 00:21:58	Arun	And also, do you want my script for name comparison as well? 
2018-03-05 07:13:07	jesse	yes plz. anything would help. 
2018-03-05 10:25:10	Arun	Okay, I will slightly modify whatever I’ve coded and send you in sometime. 
2018-03-05 10:25:10		I’m not working on it right now, but I’ll send you! Is that okay? 
2018-03-05 10:25:36	jesse	yeah. 
2018-03-05 10:25:40	jesse	Thanks

2018-03-06 14:54:17	Arun	Hey Jesse, I am so sorry, I have an important interview this Thursday and thus I am unable to work on it, as I have to prepare myself for the interview. I hope you understand and its alright. I will be back only by Thursday night. 
2018-03-06 14:56:03	jesse	yeah I got you. just means more money for me :stuck_out_tongue: 
2018-03-06 14:56:44	jesse	I might get Michael or meaghan to help code some of this up too. xD 
2018-03-08 18:51:24	Arun	Hi Jesse. 
2018-03-08 18:51:30	Arun	How you doing? 
2018-03-08 18:51:57	Arun	Is there anything that you want me to work on? I can work on it tomorrow 
2018-03-08 19:34:53	jesse	hey dude. ya know that list, YetAnotherMedicalSchoolList? 
2018-03-08 19:41:28	jesse	I would like the medical schools, all 404 of them  to have which state that they came from. This will be a big help with the comparisons.
2018-03-08 19:41:28		right now, I only have a program that gets the NC comparisons. this was done for the sake of efficiency... the program as it is takes 30 mins to run. with all 50 states, its gonna take 24 hours if we generate sql statements for all of them.... this is still far better than the estimated 600 days that a nested for loop would cause. 
2018-03-08 19:42:18	jesse	and I'm doing alright. i needed to run the pubmed data once more which kinda sucks. 
2018-03-09 02:45:49	Arun	YetAnotherMedicalSchoolList? I am not aware of that list 
2018-03-09 03:11:18	Arun	Oh, we have created all the databases now? 
2018-03-09 08:01:13	jesse	oh sorry i mustve spoken to sagar about that one 
2018-03-09 08:02:08	jesse	we dont have all the databases now since i got one generating right now. its the pubmed junk again. 
2018-03-09 08:03:20	jesse	YetAnotherMedicalSchoolList is something where I took all of the specialists medical schools and filtered out all the duplicates. its in the google drive 
2018-03-09 08:04:01	jesse	there were a few different lists of medical schools at this point, so thats what I decided to call it. 
2018-03-09 08:12:22	jesse	I've also got a program for checking for matches in the med schools. we need that program to match as many as possible without doing something complex like n grams... i think. if we do the ngrams, our program will take forever to run... although it may be feasible for just NC. 
2018-03-09 08:13:02	jesse	if you'd like to try to upgrade that program, feel free. 
2018-03-09 08:18:48	jesse	if you want to see those 2 programs, theyre in power6a under/home/jlsimps4/ForTheGreatAndPowerfulMichael/
2018-03-09 08:18:48		since michael was wanting to look into them.
2018-03-09 08:18:48		they require a database for the specialists and the pubmed stuff, so you can find those csvs in the ForMeaghan folder... to convert between the two, you can just use a psql \copy statement 
2018-03-09 19:23:01	Arun	Hey Jesse, I’m just checking out your messages. So comparing med schools, you have written a separate script? 
2018-03-09 19:24:02	Arun	And, you took the YetAnotherMedicalSchoolList from the already available specialist data ( that website you sent me previously) , I believe? 
2018-03-09 19:34:00	jesse	yep. the scripts are in the pubmed-crawler folder in the rarediseases repo 
2018-03-09 19:35:33	Arun	Okay I will look into it!  
2018-03-09 19:36:58	Arun	So, you want me to do which state does these universities/medical school come from eh?  
2018-03-09 19:38:46	jesse	yeah. preferably the two letter code. NC for north carolina. I asked sagar to look at the same thing so you may want to message him. And maybe put messages in the patientportalpeeps channel since I've had to repeat myself for both you and Sagar. 
2018-03-10 15:18:08	Arun	Alright I will talk to Sagar and check where he is 
2018-03-10 21:39:13	Arun	Hey. I checked with Sagar, he said he is good with doing that part. So, is there something else I could work on?  
2018-03-10 21:40:53	jesse	have you seen the script for the medschool comparisons ? 
2018-03-10 21:51:09	jesse	There are 2, getPhysicianPubmedConnection.py and compareMedSchools.py
2018-03-10 21:51:09		We are no longer deleting the duplicates from the pubmed dataset because we are keeping the disease ids with the articles... What this means is that it will take longer for the program  to run. We need to make it more efficient if possible.
2018-03-10 21:51:09		As for the second file, we need to do whatever we can to get more medical schools to match... this could be achieved by doing Ngrams or by removing more nonsense words. 
2018-03-10 21:51:09		and last of all, you can check if Janne needs help with the drug companies. I havent heard back from her.
2018-03-10 21:51:09		That is all I would know to do. There are also some issues you could look into on github. 
2018-03-10 21:55:19	jesse	Also stuff about Mesh terms when gathering the pubmed data... but I think we should hold off on that until we figure out  how to get these comparisons efficiently. [:+1:1] 
2018-03-11 14:39:29	Arun	I did check those scripts recently, but I will do go through it again today or tomorrow, to start looking into it. I will look at the compareMedSchools.py and see what we can we do it make it match better. 
2018-03-11 14:40:21	Arun	And yes, I will check with Janne too, and see if she is doing okay. 
2018-04-12 13:45:44	jesse	Hey Arun, in the meeting today, it seemed like you finished whatever you were doing, and the team wanted you to help me out with researching the Alternative Medicines. We don't really have any leads on that, just need to find out what sources are good for that and what we can scrape. 
2018-04-12 13:46:20	Arun	Hi Jesse, I was just about to ping you regarding the same  
2018-04-12 13:46:59	Arun	So, I need to look out for data on alternative medicines? 
2018-04-12 13:49:41	jesse	yep. do google searches, or whatever you can to build up a list of websites that we can scrape data from. 
2018-04-12 13:49:58	Arun	Yes, I can do that  
2018-04-12 13:51:01	jesse	I'll be doing the same thing, so let me know if you find anything, and I will let you know if I find anything. If we find something good enough to scrape, then we can focus on that, but for now, lets just get links. 
2018-04-12 15:08:33	Arun	Okaaay sure, sounds good  
2018-04-16 20:35:57	jesse	Hey Arun, have you been looking into alternative medicine resources? 
2018-04-17 03:47:28	Arun	Hey sorry Jesse, I was held up with my project work for the DevOps course and I am done with that just now. I will be working on it from today (Tuesday) evening  
2018-04-17 12:49:20	jesse	sorry I thought I responded to this. That's fine. I've found a few resources if you want me to give them to ya. However, I'm just trying to think about how we can turn that into something helpful to visitors of our websites, since terminology is very different in the herbal remedy world.

2018-04-20 21:42:42	Arun	I forgot to send you these links earlier. 
2018-04-20 21:43:08	Arun	Anyway, is the next step to check if the data from this website is scrap-able? 
2018-04-20 21:45:43	jesse	yeah. not just if its scrapable, but can we actually make a connection from the disease to the treatment or the symptoms to the treatment. I was looking into some other sites but the biggest issue Im finding is that the medical vocabulary doesnt match up with the herbal community vocabulary. 
2018-04-20 22:22:06	Arun	Oh yeah, that is there too. 
2018-04-20 22:22:34	Arun	We can try to do a mapping between the medical vocab and the herbal community vocab? 
2018-04-21 10:24:16	jesse	if you think thats possible, then yeah. I dont think it is. 
2018-04-23 09:15:25	jesse	I just checked out the megabionet resource which looks amazing! the only issue is the vocab problem. I'm in the lab now, and I might ask someone about it. 
2018-04-23 12:07:08	Arun	Megabionet? Can you share the link of it? I’ll just take a look at it  
2018-04-23 12:07:31	jesse	you linked it earlier. 
2018-04-23 12:08:17	Arun	Oh lol, sorry I didn’t remember the name of the links I sent you. Anyway, alright.  
2018-04-24 15:12:15	Arun	Hey, any updates on the mapping? You got any help from people at the lab? 
2018-04-24 15:13:01	jesse	no ive been handling other issues 
2018-04-27 14:07:12		getting channel history...
2018-02-18 14:40:01	Arun	Ah, I totally forgot about that! But I guess you can come inside if I'm with you 
2018-02-18 14:41:52	jesse	ok. are you there now or should i wait till 4? 
2018-02-18 14:42:16	Arun	I am here in library. We can meet now, sure! But the room is available only from 4 
2018-02-18 14:42:40	Arun	So, if you can find another room, I sure can come 
2018-02-18 14:46:44	jesse	I just checked. there is no room available that I can reserve.  
2018-02-18 14:47:03	Arun	Yeah, that's what I thought too! 
2018-02-18 14:47:29	Arun	Anyway, we can still meet now if you wish 
2018-02-18 14:52:32	jesse	sure. I'm just laying in my bed anyway. give me a few minutes to finish the current csv my computer is workin on and so I can make tea /get ready to leave 
2018-02-18 14:52:56	Arun	Yeah sure, take your time! :slightly_smiling_face: 
2018-02-18 15:03:18	jesse	im at the library now 
2018-02-18 15:03:46	Arun	Oh good. Can you come to 4th floor? I'll come near the lift 
2018-02-18 18:36:25	jesse	Did you specify in LibreOffice that the CSV's were comma separated when you opened it? 
2018-02-18 18:36:50	jesse	usually it says "separate by [] comma  [] semicolon [] space... etc 
2018-02-18 18:37:18	jesse	In the big CSV, I'm getting no entries that are overflowing. 
2018-02-18 18:39:05	jesse	Same with the little csv 
2018-02-18 18:40:22	Arun	Ah really? Damn, I didn’t notice that! But yeah, the next time I open it I’ll check that too 
2018-02-18 18:44:23	jesse	I'm gonna run the entire thing once more to try to locate the XML parsing error. hopefully I'll be able to narrow it down to a place and put a try/except thing around it to just skip the document if it fails to parse. 
2018-02-18 18:44:56	jesse	If you already have that stacktrace in your terminal, could you check the line number? 
2018-02-18 18:50:04	jesse	i think i'll just put an except around the search/query part. my guess is thats where the issue is. 
2018-02-18 18:58:01	Arun	Gimme sometime, I’ll check and let you know the line number  
2018-02-18 19:27:34	Arun	My new CSV is being generated now, and I cannot check back the stacktrace 
2018-02-18 19:27:51	jesse	thats ok. I've got a CSV generating myself. 
2018-02-18 19:28:38	jesse	quick trick: if you run "tmux" you can detach the terminal so that you can close out of the terminal and do other things while the program is being run in the background. [:+1:1 :heavy_check_mark:1] 
2018-02-18 21:16:47	jesse	I got the full csv and it's beautiful 
2018-02-18 21:17:20	jesse	i mean, its what you'd expect... a csv, but I've been working quite hard just to get it lol 
2018-02-18 21:23:57	jesse	also, I don't think I pulled your changes, since you removed the fun stuff like abstract and title 
2018-02-19 18:23:21	jesse	Hey Arun, you have yurika working on your computer right? 
2018-02-19 18:23:45	jesse	Janne was wanting to use it for getting info on drug companies. 
2018-02-19 20:40:41	Arun	Hey yeah, I have it in Running! Sorry, for the late reply  
2018-02-19 20:41:27	Arun	Janne wants to use it? Sure, we can try using it. But the websites that we use should allow crawling  
2018-02-19 20:42:18	jesse	cool. I'm not sure what Janne needs. I was working with her tonight and the drug company information is chaos. I'll try to ask Janne and get her to message 
2018-02-19 20:42:19	jesse	you 
2018-02-19 20:42:35	Arun	Or I can ping Janne right away and save some time :)  
2018-02-19 20:43:08	jesse	cool! I hope it works out. 
2018-02-19 20:43:22	Arun	Alright, pinged her now!  
2018-02-19 20:44:11	jesse	Thanks dude. i tried it on my computer but i think postgresql is forever broke on my computer from trying to mess with agensgraph 
2018-02-19 20:44:58	Arun	Ah, I see! Alright, not an issue! Let’s see if we are able to get the data using Yurika  
2018-02-26 12:51:32	Arun	Hey Jesse, I just realized that I have some work for today evening. Is it alright if we push today's meeting to tomorrow? 
2018-02-26 12:58:37	jesse	i guess that depends on everyone else. i could probably meet both today and tomorrow and not run out of things to do. 
2018-02-26 12:59:04	Arun	Okay, If others are making it, I'll try to make it too! 
2018-02-26 12:59:56	jesse	ok. if not, I can just let you know what happens, whether its by text or meeting up tomorrow. 
2018-02-26 13:00:39	Arun	Alright, that's great! I'll keep you posted :slightly_smiling_face: 
2018-02-27 09:06:59	jesse	Hey Arun, I met up with Sagar last night, and Janne separately. we've got a few issues with the pubmed stuff.
2018-02-27 09:06:59		I'll give ya a quick run down:
2018-02-27 09:06:59		our pubmed data filtered everyone who were affiliated with medical schools in NC
2018-02-27 09:06:59		our specialist data filtered everyone whos hospital was in NC.
2018-02-27 09:06:59		issue 1.   many people work in NC hospitals and have their medical degrees from places outside of NC.
2018-02-27 09:06:59		but lets ignore that for now.
2018-02-27 09:06:59		issue 2. the medical schools in the pubmed data is not uniform with the specialists data for schools they came from. matching UNC Chapel Hill would be fairly easy since Chapel Hill is unique... but take North Carolina State University... filter out the unnecessary words like "north carolina" and "university" and your left with ..."state"... which doesnt help. also consider that many pubmed researchers dont seem to be affiliated with a university or school of medicine... but rather just a lab...
2018-02-27 09:06:59		Back to Issue 1. If we want to fix this, we would be looking to scrape all of the pubmed data  rather than just NC (an estimated 300hr process with extra hours for filtering duplicates.)   alternatively, we could just  not filter the specialists at all but this comes with its own risks. (still preferable but it leads us back to issue 2.)
2018-02-27 09:06:59		As for Janne, she's been working hard scraping the drug company data. sadly a good amount of her work  must be done manually. 
2018-02-27 15:29:47	Arun	Hey Jesse, just seeing your message now. Thanks for the update! 
2018-02-27 15:31:00	Arun	Regarding issue 1, we can try to write a write to check if we are getting data properly, say upto 1000 or 10000 rows. Once we are sure about the script, we can request a machine to Meaghan and we can run our script in that machine, instead of running in our personal machine 
2018-02-27 15:42:01	jesse	that sounds reasonable, but it may be better if we could just download the entire pubmed data set rather than webscraping: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/databases/download/pubmed_medline.html
2018-02-27 15:42:01		I'm not sure if this would be too much memory or not, but they also have daily update files so we wouldn't have to re-download it every time... we would just need a way to convert the xml to postgresql... [:+1:1] 
2018-02-27 15:48:34	Arun	Oh yeah, I didnt know we could download the data directly. 
2018-02-27 15:49:28	Arun	Btw, for this week I am yet to clock in and start working on specialist-disease relation 
2018-02-27 15:49:48	jesse	ya wanna task? 
2018-02-27 15:50:02	Arun	I've been busy with my stuff. I guess I will be able to work a maximum of only 8-10 hours this week and next week 
2018-02-27 15:50:53	Arun	I will try writing the script to manipulate the name according to the pubmed data and see if I can find matches 
2018-02-27 15:51:03	Arun	Once I am done with that work, I can work on other task 
2018-02-27 15:51:28	jesse	hold on with that. 
2018-02-27 15:51:46	Arun	Are you sure about it? 
2018-02-27 15:52:01	Arun	I can hold on it and work on something more important if there is any 
2018-02-27 15:54:13	jesse	part of this past meeting was that since we cannot just match first and last name, since many first names are not full names... So we wanted to link them to their universities. So if a person with the last name of Hayes went to Chapel Hill in pubmed, we could say that they are the same person who is listed in specialists as Hayes who went to Chapel Hill. Do ya follow? 
2018-02-27 15:54:49	Arun	Okay, I get it. Yeah, it makes sense 
2018-02-27 15:56:05	jesse	Also, If we download the entire pubmed thing... and somehow make it into a pubmed database, we will need to modify whatever script you were planning on writing. 
2018-02-27 15:56:28	Arun	But, Is it the only way to confirm if two persons are the same? Is there other possibilities to confirm that. I was thinking something like, if the name is Mathew Hayes and we have M Hayes, chances that they both are same is quite high, whats your thought on that? 
2018-02-27 15:58:23	jesse	we could check firstname too... but ideally we would want M Hayes from Chapel Hill === Mathew Hayes from Chapel Hill... If we are opening up all of pubmed to all of the specialists in the united states... then first and last name is no longer accurate enough.. since there are a ton of mathew hayes from the united states whereas maybe not so much with just NC. 
2018-02-27 15:58:50	Arun	Yeah agreed! 
2018-02-27 16:00:22	Arun	But since there are way too many pubmed data and too many specialists too, the computation could take more time when we start comparing different fields simulatenously, I thought. 
2018-02-27 16:00:22		But nevertheless, what you said would definitely work :slightly_smiling_face: 
2018-02-27 16:04:28	jesse	it would take more time, but it would maybe be a couple hour process just from a rough estimate i think 
2018-02-27 16:04:46	jesse	I'll still need to confirm with Kowolenko before we actually try to do this [:+1:1] 
2018-02-27 16:25:19	Arun	Yeah thats right. And Okay, so meanwhile what do you want me to work on? 
2018-02-27 16:28:18	jesse	I think you should look into trying to find a way to compare the medical school names and see if the medical school names in the specialists match with the pubmed affiliations. 
2018-02-27 16:40:26	Arun	Okay, I will look at that today and let you know when I am done with it 
2018-02-27 16:41:25	jesse	xD I wouldn't expect you to be done with it. but let me know what your thinking about that problem. Also figured we should clarify that for the specialists, we are referring to the data from http://medicare.gov (medicare.gov) rather than the other specialist data we gathered. 
2018-02-27 16:43:07	Arun	Ahh, I see. Alright. I will look into that website and see what data we've got. And yeah, I will let you know my thoughts before I actually start coding it 
2018-02-27 16:46:31	jesse	https://data.medicare.gov/Physician-Compare/Physician-Compare-National-Downloadable-File/mj5m-pzi6

[:heavy_check_mark:1 :+1:1 :slightly_smiling_face:1] 
2018-02-27 20:13:11	jesse	Hey Arun, have you been working on that problem? ^^ 
2018-02-27 20:13:48	Arun	Not yet Jesse, I was planning to look at it tonight post dinner 
2018-02-27 20:14:50	jesse	ahh I gotcha. I was just wonderin. I'm trying to decide what I wanna do, whether it's eat dinner, work on this, or go back to my apartment and play a video game :stuck_out_tongue: 
2018-02-27 20:38:51	Arun	Haha, sometime  of video game wouldn't hurt anything I believe! :smile: 
2018-02-27 21:09:54	jesse	sadly I chose to work on another project :disappointed: 
2018-02-28 13:25:40	Arun	Hey Jesse, afternoon! So, I checked out the website and also the pubmed data. What you said makes sense. 
2018-02-28 13:25:40		And once we make all the necessary calculations, we could probably try to sort the list with current NC specialist coming on the top and then in the order of nearest states wrt NC 
2018-02-28 13:26:39	Arun	But we are expected to finish all this by next thursday? 
2018-02-28 13:29:05	jesse	did you read the messages on the rarediseases channel? 
2018-02-28 13:29:16	Arun	Yes I did 
2018-02-28 13:29:29	Arun	I just checked out the messages there 
2018-02-28 13:32:14	jesse	i gotcha. yeah we are supposed to have something to show off by next thursday. I'm thinking the only truly difficult task we will have to deal with is comparing the names of the medical schools.  If we have to download all of the pubmed data, we will have a lot more troubles, which is why I'm going to try to run the script without the NC filter and see if it takes significantly more time or not. 
2018-02-28 13:34:42	Arun	Okay that would be a start. Do you want us to meet anytime this week or weekend? I fear I won't be available next week starting Monday :disappointed: 
2018-02-28 13:35:34	jesse	I'm going to charlotte starting thursday night up until next sunday... I won't be able to meet. I can do google hangouts though... but thats not as helpful 
2018-02-28 13:37:12	Arun	Ah, I see. Alright then, we will figure it out. But let's split up the work and finish it off as much as possible. 
2018-02-28 13:38:05	Arun	One question, why do you want to strip out the University names? Like, you were saying NC State University will result in 'state' which is not of any use. But, why do we have to it? 
2018-02-28 13:44:01	jesse	agreed. I'll have more information tonight... so it'll be clearer what all we need to do by the meeting time tomorrow. No matter what though, we need to find a way to compare the University names.
2018-02-28 13:44:01		As for that, the names of the affiliations in the pubmed data are not the same as the medical schools in the specialists data. We need to find a way to connect people on first/lastname (easy) and then by the university... my thought was that we could strip away some of the meaningless words so that we could match the names of the schools... but that won't work for the above reason you mentioned. Ingrams aren't too great either since swapping North Carolina State University also could match University of North Carolina State.
2018-02-28 13:44:01		Don't get too fixated on things that I say. I'm just trying to get you to understand the problem.  If you can find a way to keep all of the words in and determine that two schools are the same, all power to ya. 
2018-02-28 13:47:57	Arun	Haha, agreed. I understand you are trying to explain me the problem. :slightly_smiling_face: 
2018-02-28 13:50:23	Arun	And alright, meanwhile, let me know if you need anything! 
2018-02-28 13:50:40	jesse	Sure thing. 
2018-03-01 14:03:57	jesse	I posted the notes/todo thing I made for the week. take a look at that and then you can ask me if you have any questions. 
2018-03-01 20:16:16	Arun	Hey, I just had a look at it now. 
2018-03-01 20:19:33	Arun	I see there are immediate stuffs to get done with regard to matching physicians with pubmed data. Will you be working on any task particularly? 
2018-03-01 21:17:22	jesse	i havent decided the order Ill start tackling these things yet. sorry i didnt respond. i was driving 
2018-03-01 21:18:27	Arun	No worries! :slightly_smiling_face: And, let me know how we can go about it, if you got any leads 
2018-03-04 01:18:58	Arun	Hey, so for comparing the affiliation from pubmed and physician's medical school name, we can probably just check if medical school name is present in pubmed affiliation. 
2018-03-04 01:18:58		For example, as far as I noticed, the Physician's medical school name is pretty organised, but pubmed affiliations seem to have lot of redundant names.
2018-03-04 01:18:58		In this method, we can convert the physician's medical school name to an array and check if all the elements of the array is in pubmed affiliation. If so, we can assure that they both are the same person. 
2018-03-04 01:18:58		What do you think about this? 
2018-03-04 01:22:05	Arun	And for us to match physicians data from pubmed and physician data, the fastest method would be to put it in a DB and then querying it. 
2018-03-04 09:12:58	jesse	Hey Arun, I agree that the pubmed data is scattered and that the physician data is more organized and condensed. however, I dont think it will be enough to just check if the physician med school is in the affiliation.
2018-03-04 09:12:58		Have you taken a look at certain schools that would and would not match under this scenario? If you have, and you are comfortable with the results that gives, then sure... but im thinking we may need to worry about ngrams and abbreviations.
2018-03-04 09:12:58		Ive been trying to compile a list of all schools contained in the pubmed data and sort them, but it's been running for twelve hours and I dont think itll finish. maybe i should try a much smaller dataset.. 
2018-03-04 09:18:25	jesse	I've got a list  of the affiliations that came from diseases beginning with X-Z 
2018-03-04 09:19:24	jesse	maybe we can use that and the list of med schools from the physician data to help us determine a good matching system. 
2018-03-04 09:30:50	jesse	I also had Sagar working a lil bit on this. I gave him a list of 400 med school names that came from the physician data and had him make abbreviations for each one. (i hope he wrote a program to do this lol) 
2018-03-04 12:00:15	Arun	Right, and for matching two med school names, I can probably write a script that would take care of abbreviations too. It will be very similar to the script I wrote for comparing names in any order 
2018-03-04 12:06:22	jesse	ok. if you can, try to make it so that we arent loading the entire CSVs into the script.
2018-03-04 12:06:22		many of these files are gigabytes of text, so we will run out of memory if we do that. 
2018-03-04 12:15:54	Arun	Right, well I’m sure of how to do that part. Like, I can read from the CSV and for each line in the CSV, I will have to read from the physician’s CSV. But, in this way, for each ‘row’ in the pubmed, I will be reading all the rows from the physician CSV, every time. 
2018-03-04 12:15:54		Is there any other way that you know of? 
2018-03-04 12:16:11	Arun	I mean, I’m *not sure of how to do that part 
2018-03-04 12:30:35	jesse	I'm not sure either. 
2018-03-04 12:39:42	jesse	I'm gonna try to filter out the duplicates out of the pubmed data once again and see what the file size is. 
2018-03-04 12:56:03	jesse	Are you working on raredx stuff right now? 
2018-03-04 12:58:02	Arun	I'm guessing the best way to go forward would be to put it on a DB and query data. 
2018-03-04 12:58:52	Arun	Anyway, I am not working on it right now. 
2018-03-04 13:07:09	jesse	put what specifically on the db? 
2018-03-04 13:07:34	Arun	Both, the pubmed data and the physician data. Instead of having it on a CSV 
2018-03-04 13:09:25	Arun	Do you believe our searching would be faster that way? 
2018-03-04 13:15:59	jesse	I'm not sure it would matter. once pandas loads it into memory, it doesn't matter. if you were thinking of doing some sort of join statement or some python thing that worked directly with psql, then it would be faster. 
2018-03-04 15:08:59	Arun	Yeah, thats true too, alright then 
2018-03-04 20:08:59	jesse	arun, do you have a script for the medschool comparison? 
2018-03-04 21:03:00	Arun	Hey, I will send you in sometime, like half hour? I am on my way home now from outside 
2018-03-04 21:03:51	jesse	sounds good 
2018-03-04 22:23:18	Arun	Hi Jesse :slightly_smiling_face: 
2018-03-04 22:24:51	Arun	Can I send the script here? 
2018-03-04 22:27:56	Arun	@Arun uploaded a file: https://ncstateuniversityitng.slack.com/files/U95TJ10M9/F9JFZ3Z45/comparemednames.py (compareMedNames.py) and commented: Script that compares Medical School Names from pubmed data and physcian data 
2018-03-04 22:30:22	Arun	I ran this script by taking names manually form the pubmed csv and the physician data. And it worked fine for the names I used. 
2018-03-04 22:31:42	Arun	I wouldn't say this script works very fine.  There will definitely be some good amount of false positive. But since we are already comparing the names, and this is more like a second factor to affirm our decision if two persons are the same, I'm hoping this would work fine. 
2018-03-04 22:36:20	Arun	@Arun uploaded a file: https://ncstateuniversityitng.slack.com/files/U95TJ10M9/F9JBS09T6/pip_package_for_fuzzywuzzy.txt (pip package for fuzzywuzzy) and commented: Forgot to mention, you need to install the fuzzywuzzy package for this. 
2018-03-04 23:04:26	jesse	I'll take a look tomorrow. i appreciate it dude. i tried to run a script tonight but my computer froze again.... these files are just too big :( 
2018-03-05 00:21:37	Arun	Ah, I see. Yeah please run it tomorrow and let me know how it runs against our data. :slightly_smiling_face: Thanks Jesse 
2018-03-05 00:21:58	Arun	And also, do you want my script for name comparison as well? 
2018-03-05 07:13:07	jesse	yes plz. anything would help. 
2018-03-05 10:25:10	Arun	Okay, I will slightly modify whatever I’ve coded and send you in sometime. 
2018-03-05 10:25:10		I’m not working on it right now, but I’ll send you! Is that okay? 
2018-03-05 10:25:36	jesse	yeah. 
2018-03-05 10:25:40	jesse	Thanks 
2018-03-05 16:44:45	Arun	@Arun uploaded a file: https://ncstateuniversityitng.slack.com/files/U95TJ10M9/F9JBZ2HND/comparenames.py (compareNames.py) 
2018-03-06 14:54:17	Arun	Hey Jesse, I am so sorry, I have an important interview this Thursday and thus I am unable to work on it, as I have to prepare myself for the interview. I hope you understand and its alright. I will be back only by Thursday night. 
2018-03-06 14:56:03	jesse	yeah I got you. just means more money for me :stuck_out_tongue: 
2018-03-06 14:56:44	jesse	I might get Michael or meaghan to help code some of this up too. xD 
2018-03-08 18:51:24	Arun	Hi Jesse. 
2018-03-08 18:51:30	Arun	How you doing? 
2018-03-08 18:51:57	Arun	Is there anything that you want me to work on? I can work on it tomorrow 
2018-03-08 19:34:53	jesse	hey dude. ya know that list, YetAnotherMedicalSchoolList? 
2018-03-08 19:41:28	jesse	I would like the medical schools, all 404 of them  to have which state that they came from. This will be a big help with the comparisons.
2018-03-08 19:41:28		right now, I only have a program that gets the NC comparisons. this was done for the sake of efficiency... the program as it is takes 30 mins to run. with all 50 states, its gonna take 24 hours if we generate sql statements for all of them.... this is still far better than the estimated 600 days that a nested for loop would cause. 
2018-03-08 19:42:18	jesse	and I'm doing alright. i needed to run the pubmed data once more which kinda sucks. 
2018-03-09 02:45:49	Arun	YetAnotherMedicalSchoolList? I am not aware of that list 
2018-03-09 03:11:18	Arun	Oh, we have created all the databases now? 
2018-03-09 08:01:13	jesse	oh sorry i mustve spoken to sagar about that one 
2018-03-09 08:02:08	jesse	we dont have all the databases now since i got one generating right now. its the pubmed junk again. 
2018-03-09 08:03:20	jesse	YetAnotherMedicalSchoolList is something where I took all of the specialists medical schools and filtered out all the duplicates. its in the google drive 
2018-03-09 08:04:01	jesse	there were a few different lists of medical schools at this point, so thats what I decided to call it. 
2018-03-09 08:12:22	jesse	I've also got a program for checking for matches in the med schools. we need that program to match as many as possible without doing something complex like n grams... i think. if we do the ngrams, our program will take forever to run... although it may be feasible for just NC. 
2018-03-09 08:13:02	jesse	if you'd like to try to upgrade that program, feel free. 
2018-03-09 08:18:48	jesse	if you want to see those 2 programs, theyre in power6a under/home/jlsimps4/ForTheGreatAndPowerfulMichael/
2018-03-09 08:18:48		since michael was wanting to look into them.
2018-03-09 08:18:48		they require a database for the specialists and the pubmed stuff, so you can find those csvs in the ForMeaghan folder... to convert between the two, you can just use a psql \copy statement 
2018-03-09 19:23:01	Arun	Hey Jesse, I’m just checking out your messages. So comparing med schools, you have written a separate script? 
2018-03-09 19:24:02	Arun	And, you took the YetAnotherMedicalSchoolList from the already available specialist data ( that website you sent me previously) , I believe? 
2018-03-09 19:34:00	jesse	yep. the scripts are in the pubmed-crawler folder in the rarediseases repo 
2018-03-09 19:35:33	Arun	Okay I will look into it!  
2018-03-09 19:36:58	Arun	So, you want me to do which state does these universities/medical school come from eh?  
2018-03-09 19:38:46	jesse	yeah. preferably the two letter code. NC for north carolina. I asked sagar to look at the same thing so you may want to message him. And maybe put messages in the patientportalpeeps channel since I've had to repeat myself for both you and Sagar. 
2018-03-10 15:18:08	Arun	Alright I will talk to Sagar and check where he is 
2018-03-10 21:39:13	Arun	Hey. I checked with Sagar, he said he is good with doing that part. So, is there something else I could work on?  
2018-03-10 21:40:53	jesse	have you seen the script for the medschool comparisons ? 
2018-03-10 21:51:09	jesse	There are 2, getPhysicianPubmedConnection.py and compareMedSchools.py
2018-03-10 21:51:09		We are no longer deleting the duplicates from the pubmed dataset because we are keeping the disease ids with the articles... What this means is that it will take longer for the program  to run. We need to make it more efficient if possible.
2018-03-10 21:51:09		As for the second file, we need to do whatever we can to get more medical schools to match... this could be achieved by doing Ngrams or by removing more nonsense words. 
2018-03-10 21:51:09		and last of all, you can check if Janne needs help with the drug companies. I havent heard back from her.
2018-03-10 21:51:09		That is all I would know to do. There are also some issues you could look into on github. 
2018-03-10 21:55:19	jesse	Also stuff about Mesh terms when gathering the pubmed data... but I think we should hold off on that until we figure out  how to get these comparisons efficiently. [:+1:1] 
2018-03-11 14:39:29	Arun	I did check those scripts recently, but I will do go through it again today or tomorrow, to start looking into it. I will look at the compareMedSchools.py and see what we can we do it make it match better. 
2018-03-11 14:40:21	Arun	And yes, I will check with Janne too, and see if she is doing okay. 
2018-04-12 13:45:44	jesse	Hey Arun, in the meeting today, it seemed like you finished whatever you were doing, and the team wanted you to help me out with researching the Alternative Medicines. We don't really have any leads on that, just need to find out what sources are good for that and what we can scrape. 
2018-04-12 13:46:20	Arun	Hi Jesse, I was just about to ping you regarding the same  
2018-04-12 13:46:59	Arun	So, I need to look out for data on alternative medicines? 
2018-04-12 13:49:41	jesse	yep. do google searches, or whatever you can to build up a list of websites that we can scrape data from. 
2018-04-12 13:49:58	Arun	Yes, I can do that  
2018-04-12 13:51:01	jesse	I'll be doing the same thing, so let me know if you find anything, and I will let you know if I find anything. If we find something good enough to scrape, then we can focus on that, but for now, lets just get links. 
2018-04-12 15:08:33	Arun	Okaaay sure, sounds good  
2018-04-16 20:35:57	jesse	Hey Arun, have you been looking into alternative medicine resources? 
2018-04-17 03:47:28	Arun	Hey sorry Jesse, I was held up with my project work for the DevOps course and I am done with that just now. I will be working on it from today (Tuesday) evening  
2018-04-17 12:49:20	jesse	sorry I thought I responded to this. That's fine. I've found a few resources if you want me to give them to ya. However, I'm just trying to think about how we can turn that into something helpful to visitors of our websites, since terminology is very different in the herbal remedy world. 
2018-04-17 12:49:43	jesse	Best resources I have seen

2018-04-20 21:43:08	Arun	Anyway, is the next step to check if the data from this website is scrap-able? 
2018-04-20 21:45:43	jesse	yeah. not just if its scrapable, but can we actually make a connection from the disease to the treatment or the symptoms to the treatment. I was looking into some other sites but the biggest issue Im finding is that the medical vocabulary doesnt match up with the herbal community vocabulary. 
2018-04-20 22:22:06	Arun	Oh yeah, that is there too. 
2018-04-20 22:22:34	Arun	We can try to do a mapping between the medical vocab and the herbal community vocab? 
2018-04-21 10:24:16	jesse	if you think thats possible, then yeah. I dont think it is. 
2018-04-23 09:15:25	jesse	I just checked out the megabionet resource which looks amazing! the only issue is the vocab problem. I'm in the lab now, and I might ask someone about it. 
2018-04-23 12:07:08	Arun	Megabionet? Can you share the link of it? I’ll just take a look at it  
2018-04-23 12:07:31	jesse	you linked it earlier. 
2018-04-23 12:08:17	Arun	Oh lol, sorry I didn’t remember the name of the links I sent you. Anyway, alright.  
2018-04-24 15:12:15	Arun	Hey, any updates on the mapping? You got any help from people at the lab? 
2018-04-24 15:13:01	jesse	no ive been handling other issues 
2018-04-26 17:11:06	Arun	Hi, any updates on that? I was looking up for links with the medical names, but I couldnt find any as such 
2018-04-26 17:13:55	Arun	I mean, I was looking for websites that has data with their medical names and not the herbal vocab, but I couldn't find anything useful. 
2018-04-26 17:18:11	jesse	nah, you would want to map the symptomatic words in the herbal data to organ systems and then map those organ systems to the phenotypes in the database. I havent done this yet.
2018-04-26 17:18:11		there might be other ways to do it manually though. 
2018-04-26 17:34:53	Arun	Okay, and Megan and co, are they okay doing this way? 
2018-04-26 17:54:15	jesse	they didn't say much. we can just do it and worry about their opinions later. 
2018-04-27 14:35:51	jesse	Hey Arun, I made a sample script that I'm going to push now for comparing herbal remedies to the phenotypes. obviously, we will need to find a way to refine the search than just checking if strings match, but itll at least give you something to work with. 
2018-04-28 10:28:13		getting channel history...
2018-02-18 14:41:52	jesse	ok. are you there now or should i wait till 4? 
2018-02-18 14:42:16	Arun	I am here in library. We can meet now, sure! But the room is available only from 4 
2018-02-18 14:42:40	Arun	So, if you can find another room, I sure can come 
2018-02-18 14:46:44	jesse	I just checked. there is no room available that I can reserve.  
2018-02-18 14:47:03	Arun	Yeah, that's what I thought too! 
2018-02-18 14:47:29	Arun	Anyway, we can still meet now if you wish 
2018-02-18 14:52:32	jesse	sure. I'm just laying in my bed anyway. give me a few minutes to finish the current csv my computer is workin on and so I can make tea /get ready to leave 
2018-02-18 14:52:56	Arun	Yeah sure, take your time! :slightly_smiling_face: 
2018-02-18 15:03:18	jesse	im at the library now 
2018-02-18 15:03:46	Arun	Oh good. Can you come to 4th floor? I'll come near the lift 
2018-02-18 18:36:25	jesse	Did you specify in LibreOffice that the CSV's were comma separated when you opened it? 
2018-02-18 18:36:50	jesse	usually it says "separate by [] comma  [] semicolon [] space... etc 
2018-02-18 18:37:18	jesse	In the big CSV, I'm getting no entries that are overflowing. 
2018-02-18 18:39:05	jesse	Same with the little csv 
2018-02-18 18:40:22	Arun	Ah really? Damn, I didn’t notice that! But yeah, the next time I open it I’ll check that too 
2018-02-18 18:44:23	jesse	I'm gonna run the entire thing once more to try to locate the XML parsing error. hopefully I'll be able to narrow it down to a place and put a try/except thing around it to just skip the document if it fails to parse. 
2018-02-18 18:44:56	jesse	If you already have that stacktrace in your terminal, could you check the line number? 
2018-02-18 18:50:04	jesse	i think i'll just put an except around the search/query part. my guess is thats where the issue is. 
2018-02-18 18:58:01	Arun	Gimme sometime, I’ll check and let you know the line number  
2018-02-18 19:27:34	Arun	My new CSV is being generated now, and I cannot check back the stacktrace 
2018-02-18 19:27:51	jesse	thats ok. I've got a CSV generating myself. 
2018-02-18 19:28:38	jesse	quick trick: if you run "tmux" you can detach the terminal so that you can close out of the terminal and do other things while the program is being run in the background. [:+1:1 :heavy_check_mark:1] 
2018-02-18 21:16:47	jesse	I got the full csv and it's beautiful 
2018-02-18 21:17:20	jesse	i mean, its what you'd expect... a csv, but I've been working quite hard just to get it lol 
2018-02-18 21:23:57	jesse	also, I don't think I pulled your changes, since you removed the fun stuff like abstract and title 
2018-02-19 18:23:21	jesse	Hey Arun, you have yurika working on your computer right? 
2018-02-19 18:23:45	jesse	Janne was wanting to use it for getting info on drug companies. 
2018-02-19 20:40:41	Arun	Hey yeah, I have it in Running! Sorry, for the late reply  
2018-02-19 20:41:27	Arun	Janne wants to use it? Sure, we can try using it. But the websites that we use should allow crawling  
2018-02-19 20:42:18	jesse	cool. I'm not sure what Janne needs. I was working with her tonight and the drug company information is chaos. I'll try to ask Janne and get her to message 
2018-02-19 20:42:19	jesse	you 
2018-02-19 20:42:35	Arun	Or I can ping Janne right away and save some time :)  
2018-02-19 20:43:08	jesse	cool! I hope it works out. 
2018-02-19 20:43:22	Arun	Alright, pinged her now!  
2018-02-19 20:44:11	jesse	Thanks dude. i tried it on my computer but i think postgresql is forever broke on my computer from trying to mess with agensgraph 
2018-02-19 20:44:58	Arun	Ah, I see! Alright, not an issue! Let’s see if we are able to get the data using Yurika  
2018-02-26 12:51:32	Arun	Hey Jesse, I just realized that I have some work for today evening. Is it alright if we push today's meeting to tomorrow? 
2018-02-26 12:58:37	jesse	i guess that depends on everyone else. i could probably meet both today and tomorrow and not run out of things to do. 
2018-02-26 12:59:04	Arun	Okay, If others are making it, I'll try to make it too! 
2018-02-26 12:59:56	jesse	ok. if not, I can just let you know what happens, whether its by text or meeting up tomorrow. 
2018-02-26 13:00:39	Arun	Alright, that's great! I'll keep you posted :slightly_smiling_face: 
2018-02-27 09:06:59	jesse	Hey Arun, I met up with Sagar last night, and Janne separately. we've got a few issues with the pubmed stuff.
2018-02-27 09:06:59		I'll give ya a quick run down:
2018-02-27 09:06:59		our pubmed data filtered everyone who were affiliated with medical schools in NC
2018-02-27 09:06:59		our specialist data filtered everyone whos hospital was in NC.
2018-02-27 09:06:59		issue 1.   many people work in NC hospitals and have their medical degrees from places outside of NC.
2018-02-27 09:06:59		but lets ignore that for now.
2018-02-27 09:06:59		issue 2. the medical schools in the pubmed data is not uniform with the specialists data for schools they came from. matching UNC Chapel Hill would be fairly easy since Chapel Hill is unique... but take North Carolina State University... filter out the unnecessary words like "north carolina" and "university" and your left with ..."state"... which doesnt help. also consider that many pubmed researchers dont seem to be affiliated with a university or school of medicine... but rather just a lab...
2018-02-27 09:06:59		Back to Issue 1. If we want to fix this, we would be looking to scrape all of the pubmed data  rather than just NC (an estimated 300hr process with extra hours for filtering duplicates.)   alternatively, we could just  not filter the specialists at all but this comes with its own risks. (still preferable but it leads us back to issue 2.)
2018-02-27 09:06:59		As for Janne, she's been working hard scraping the drug company data. sadly a good amount of her work  must be done manually. 
2018-02-27 15:29:47	Arun	Hey Jesse, just seeing your message now. Thanks for the update! 
2018-02-27 15:31:00	Arun	Regarding issue 1, we can try to write a write to check if we are getting data properly, say upto 1000 or 10000 rows. Once we are sure about the script, we can request a machine to Meaghan and we can run our script in that machine, instead of running in our personal machine 
2018-02-27 15:42:01	jesse	that sounds reasonable, but it may be better if we could just download the entire pubmed data set rather than webscraping: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/databases/download/pubmed_medline.html
2018-02-27 15:42:01		I'm not sure if this would be too much memory or not, but they also have daily update files so we wouldn't have to re-download it every time... we would just need a way to convert the xml to postgresql... [:+1:1] 
2018-02-27 15:48:34	Arun	Oh yeah, I didnt know we could download the data directly. 
2018-02-27 15:49:28	Arun	Btw, for this week I am yet to clock in and start working on specialist-disease relation 
2018-02-27 15:49:48	jesse	ya wanna task? 
2018-02-27 15:50:02	Arun	I've been busy with my stuff. I guess I will be able to work a maximum of only 8-10 hours this week and next week 
2018-02-27 15:50:53	Arun	I will try writing the script to manipulate the name according to the pubmed data and see if I can find matches 
2018-02-27 15:51:03	Arun	Once I am done with that work, I can work on other task 
2018-02-27 15:51:28	jesse	hold on with that. 
2018-02-27 15:51:46	Arun	Are you sure about it? 
2018-02-27 15:52:01	Arun	I can hold on it and work on something more important if there is any 
2018-02-27 15:54:13	jesse	part of this past meeting was that since we cannot just match first and last name, since many first names are not full names... So we wanted to link them to their universities. So if a person with the last name of Hayes went to Chapel Hill in pubmed, we could say that they are the same person who is listed in specialists as Hayes who went to Chapel Hill. Do ya follow? 
2018-02-27 15:54:49	Arun	Okay, I get it. Yeah, it makes sense 
2018-02-27 15:56:05	jesse	Also, If we download the entire pubmed thing... and somehow make it into a pubmed database, we will need to modify whatever script you were planning on writing. 
2018-02-27 15:56:28	Arun	But, Is it the only way to confirm if two persons are the same? Is there other possibilities to confirm that. I was thinking something like, if the name is Mathew Hayes and we have M Hayes, chances that they both are same is quite high, whats your thought on that? 
2018-02-27 15:58:23	jesse	we could check firstname too... but ideally we would want M Hayes from Chapel Hill === Mathew Hayes from Chapel Hill... If we are opening up all of pubmed to all of the specialists in the united states... then first and last name is no longer accurate enough.. since there are a ton of mathew hayes from the united states whereas maybe not so much with just NC. 
2018-02-27 15:58:50	Arun	Yeah agreed! 
2018-02-27 16:00:22	Arun	But since there are way too many pubmed data and too many specialists too, the computation could take more time when we start comparing different fields simulatenously, I thought. 
2018-02-27 16:00:22		But nevertheless, what you said would definitely work :slightly_smiling_face: 
2018-02-27 16:04:28	jesse	it would take more time, but it would maybe be a couple hour process just from a rough estimate i think 
2018-02-27 16:04:46	jesse	I'll still need to confirm with Kowolenko before we actually try to do this [:+1:1] 
2018-02-27 16:25:19	Arun	Yeah thats right. And Okay, so meanwhile what do you want me to work on? 
2018-02-27 16:28:18	jesse	I think you should look into trying to find a way to compare the medical school names and see if the medical school names in the specialists match with the pubmed affiliations. 
2018-02-27 16:40:26	Arun	Okay, I will look at that today and let you know when I am done with it 
2018-02-27 16:41:25	jesse	xD I wouldn't expect you to be done with it. but let me know what your thinking about that problem. Also figured we should clarify that for the specialists, we are referring to the data from http://medicare.gov (medicare.gov) rather than the other specialist data we gathered. 
2018-02-27 16:43:07	Arun	Ahh, I see. Alright. I will look into that website and see what data we've got. And yeah, I will let you know my thoughts before I actually start coding it 
2018-02-27 16:46:31	jesse	https://data.medicare.gov/Physician-Compare/Physician-Compare-National-Downloadable-File/mj5m-pzi6
2018-02-27 16:46:31		Physician Compare National Downloadable File | Data.Medicare.gov

[:heavy_check_mark:1 :+1:1 :slightly_smiling_face:1] 
2018-02-27 20:13:11	jesse	Hey Arun, have you been working on that problem? ^^ 
2018-02-27 20:13:48	Arun	Not yet Jesse, I was planning to look at it tonight post dinner 
2018-02-27 20:14:50	jesse	ahh I gotcha. I was just wonderin. I'm trying to decide what I wanna do, whether it's eat dinner, work on this, or go back to my apartment and play a video game :stuck_out_tongue: 
2018-02-27 20:38:51	Arun	Haha, sometime  of video game wouldn't hurt anything I believe! :smile: 
2018-02-27 21:09:54	jesse	sadly I chose to work on another project :disappointed: 
2018-02-28 13:25:40	Arun	Hey Jesse, afternoon! So, I checked out the website and also the pubmed data. What you said makes sense. 
2018-02-28 13:25:40		And once we make all the necessary calculations, we could probably try to sort the list with current NC specialist coming on the top and then in the order of nearest states wrt NC 
2018-02-28 13:26:39	Arun	But we are expected to finish all this by next thursday? 
2018-02-28 13:29:05	jesse	did you read the messages on the rarediseases channel? 
2018-02-28 13:29:16	Arun	Yes I did 
2018-02-28 13:29:29	Arun	I just checked out the messages there 
2018-02-28 13:32:14	jesse	i gotcha. yeah we are supposed to have something to show off by next thursday. I'm thinking the only truly difficult task we will have to deal with is comparing the names of the medical schools.  If we have to download all of the pubmed data, we will have a lot more troubles, which is why I'm going to try to run the script without the NC filter and see if it takes significantly more time or not. 
2018-02-28 13:34:42	Arun	Okay that would be a start. Do you want us to meet anytime this week or weekend? I fear I won't be available next week starting Monday :disappointed: 
2018-02-28 13:35:34	jesse	I'm going to charlotte starting thursday night up until next sunday... I won't be able to meet. I can do google hangouts though... but thats not as helpful 
2018-02-28 13:37:12	Arun	Ah, I see. Alright then, we will figure it out. But let's split up the work and finish it off as much as possible. 
2018-02-28 13:38:05	Arun	One question, why do you want to strip out the University names? Like, you were saying NC State University will result in 'state' which is not of any use. But, why do we have to it? 
2018-02-28 13:44:01	jesse	agreed. I'll have more information tonight... so it'll be clearer what all we need to do by the meeting time tomorrow. No matter what though, we need to find a way to compare the University names.
2018-02-28 13:44:01		As for that, the names of the affiliations in the pubmed data are not the same as the medical schools in the specialists data. We need to find a way to connect people on first/lastname (easy) and then by the university... my thought was that we could strip away some of the meaningless words so that we could match the names of the schools... but that won't work for the above reason you mentioned. Ingrams aren't too great either since swapping North Carolina State University also could match University of North Carolina State.
2018-02-28 13:44:01		Don't get too fixated on things that I say. I'm just trying to get you to understand the problem.  If you can find a way to keep all of the words in and determine that two schools are the same, all power to ya. 
2018-02-28 13:47:57	Arun	Haha, agreed. I understand you are trying to explain me the problem. :slightly_smiling_face: 
2018-02-28 13:50:23	Arun	And alright, meanwhile, let me know if you need anything! 
2018-02-28 13:50:40	jesse	Sure thing. 
2018-03-01 14:03:57	jesse	I posted the notes/todo thing I made for the week. take a look at that and then you can ask me if you have any questions. 
2018-03-01 20:16:16	Arun	Hey, I just had a look at it now. 
2018-03-01 20:19:33	Arun	I see there are immediate stuffs to get done with regard to matching physicians with pubmed data. Will you be working on any task particularly? 
2018-03-01 21:17:22	jesse	i havent decided the order Ill start tackling these things yet. sorry i didnt respond. i was driving 
2018-03-01 21:18:27	Arun	No worries! :slightly_smiling_face: And, let me know how we can go about it, if you got any leads 
2018-03-04 01:18:58	Arun	Hey, so for comparing the affiliation from pubmed and physician's medical school name, we can probably just check if medical school name is present in pubmed affiliation. 
2018-03-04 01:18:58		For example, as far as I noticed, the Physician's medical school name is pretty organised, but pubmed affiliations seem to have lot of redundant names.
2018-03-04 01:18:58		In this method, we can convert the physician's medical school name to an array and check if all the elements of the array is in pubmed affiliation. If so, we can assure that they both are the same person. 
2018-03-04 01:18:58		What do you think about this? 
2018-03-04 01:22:05	Arun	And for us to match physicians data from pubmed and physician data, the fastest method would be to put it in a DB and then querying it. 
2018-03-04 09:12:58	jesse	Hey Arun, I agree that the pubmed data is scattered and that the physician data is more organized and condensed. however, I dont think it will be enough to just check if the physician med school is in the affiliation.
2018-03-04 09:12:58		Have you taken a look at certain schools that would and would not match under this scenario? If you have, and you are comfortable with the results that gives, then sure... but im thinking we may need to worry about ngrams and abbreviations.
2018-03-04 09:12:58		Ive been trying to compile a list of all schools contained in the pubmed data and sort them, but it's been running for twelve hours and I dont think itll finish. maybe i should try a much smaller dataset.. 
2018-03-04 09:18:25	jesse	I've got a list  of the affiliations that came from diseases beginning with X-Z 
2018-03-04 09:19:24	jesse	maybe we can use that and the list of med schools from the physician data to help us determine a good matching system. 
2018-03-04 09:30:50	jesse	I also had Sagar working a lil bit on this. I gave him a list of 400 med school names that came from the physician data and had him make abbreviations for each one. (i hope he wrote a program to do this lol) 
2018-03-04 12:00:15	Arun	Right, and for matching two med school names, I can probably write a script that would take care of abbreviations too. It will be very similar to the script I wrote for comparing names in any order 
2018-03-04 12:06:22	jesse	ok. if you can, try to make it so that we arent loading the entire CSVs into the script.
2018-03-04 12:06:22		many of these files are gigabytes of text, so we will run out of memory if we do that. 
2018-03-04 12:15:54	Arun	Right, well I’m sure of how to do that part. Like, I can read from the CSV and for each line in the CSV, I will have to read from the physician’s CSV. But, in this way, for each ‘row’ in the pubmed, I will be reading all the rows from the physician CSV, every time. 
2018-03-04 12:15:54		Is there any other way that you know of? 
2018-03-04 12:16:11	Arun	I mean, I’m *not sure of how to do that part 
2018-03-04 12:30:35	jesse	I'm not sure either. 
2018-03-04 12:39:42	jesse	I'm gonna try to filter out the duplicates out of the pubmed data once again and see what the file size is. 
2018-03-04 12:56:03	jesse	Are you working on raredx stuff right now? 
2018-03-04 12:58:02	Arun	I'm guessing the best way to go forward would be to put it on a DB and query data. 
2018-03-04 12:58:52	Arun	Anyway, I am not working on it right now. 
2018-03-04 13:07:09	jesse	put what specifically on the db? 
2018-03-04 13:07:34	Arun	Both, the pubmed data and the physician data. Instead of having it on a CSV 
2018-03-04 13:09:25	Arun	Do you believe our searching would be faster that way? 
2018-03-04 13:15:59	jesse	I'm not sure it would matter. once pandas loads it into memory, it doesn't matter. if you were thinking of doing some sort of join statement or some python thing that worked directly with psql, then it would be faster. 
2018-03-04 15:08:59	Arun	Yeah, thats true too, alright then 
2018-03-04 20:08:59	jesse	arun, do you have a script for the medschool comparison? 
2018-03-04 21:03:00	Arun	Hey, I will send you in sometime, like half hour? I am on my way home now from outside 
2018-03-04 21:03:51	jesse	sounds good 
2018-03-04 22:23:18	Arun	Hi Jesse :slightly_smiling_face: 
2018-03-04 22:24:51	Arun	Can I send the script here? 
2018-03-04 22:27:56	Arun	@Arun uploaded a file: https://ncstateuniversityitng.slack.com/files/U95TJ10M9/F9JFZ3Z45/comparemednames.py (compareMedNames.py) and commented: Script that compares Medical School Names from pubmed data and physcian data 
2018-03-04 22:30:22	Arun	I ran this script by taking names manually form the pubmed csv and the physician data. And it worked fine for the names I used. 
2018-03-04 22:31:42	Arun	I wouldn't say this script works very fine.  There will definitely be some good amount of false positive. But since we are already comparing the names, and this is more like a second factor to affirm our decision if two persons are the same, I'm hoping this would work fine. 
2018-03-04 22:36:20	Arun	@Arun uploaded a file: https://ncstateuniversityitng.slack.com/files/U95TJ10M9/F9JBS09T6/pip_package_for_fuzzywuzzy.txt (pip package for fuzzywuzzy) and commented: Forgot to mention, you need to install the fuzzywuzzy package for this. 
2018-03-04 23:04:26	jesse	I'll take a look tomorrow. i appreciate it dude. i tried to run a script tonight but my computer froze again.... these files are just too big :( 
2018-03-05 00:21:37	Arun	Ah, I see. Yeah please run it tomorrow and let me know how it runs against our data. :slightly_smiling_face: Thanks Jesse 
2018-03-05 00:21:58	Arun	And also, do you want my script for name comparison as well? 
2018-03-05 07:13:07	jesse	yes plz. anything would help. 
2018-03-05 10:25:10	Arun	Okay, I will slightly modify whatever I’ve coded and send you in sometime. 
2018-03-05 10:25:10		I’m not working on it right now, but I’ll send you! Is that okay? 
2018-03-05 10:25:36	jesse	yeah. 
2018-03-05 10:25:40	jesse	Thanks

2018-03-06 14:54:17	Arun	Hey Jesse, I am so sorry, I have an important interview this Thursday and thus I am unable to work on it, as I have to prepare myself for the interview. I hope you understand and its alright. I will be back only by Thursday night. 
2018-03-06 14:56:03	jesse	yeah I got you. just means more money for me :stuck_out_tongue: 
2018-03-06 14:56:44	jesse	I might get Michael or meaghan to help code some of this up too. xD 
2018-03-08 18:51:24	Arun	Hi Jesse. 
2018-03-08 18:51:30	Arun	How you doing? 
2018-03-08 18:51:57	Arun	Is there anything that you want me to work on? I can work on it tomorrow 
2018-03-08 19:34:53	jesse	hey dude. ya know that list, YetAnotherMedicalSchoolList? 
2018-03-08 19:41:28	jesse	I would like the medical schools, all 404 of them  to have which state that they came from. This will be a big help with the comparisons.
2018-03-08 19:41:28		right now, I only have a program that gets the NC comparisons. this was done for the sake of efficiency... the program as it is takes 30 mins to run. with all 50 states, its gonna take 24 hours if we generate sql statements for all of them.... this is still far better than the estimated 600 days that a nested for loop would cause. 
2018-03-08 19:42:18	jesse	and I'm doing alright. i needed to run the pubmed data once more which kinda sucks. 
2018-03-09 02:45:49	Arun	YetAnotherMedicalSchoolList? I am not aware of that list 
2018-03-09 03:11:18	Arun	Oh, we have created all the databases now? 
2018-03-09 08:01:13	jesse	oh sorry i mustve spoken to sagar about that one 
2018-03-09 08:02:08	jesse	we dont have all the databases now since i got one generating right now. its the pubmed junk again. 
2018-03-09 08:03:20	jesse	YetAnotherMedicalSchoolList is something where I took all of the specialists medical schools and filtered out all the duplicates. its in the google drive 
2018-03-09 08:04:01	jesse	there were a few different lists of medical schools at this point, so thats what I decided to call it. 
2018-03-09 08:12:22	jesse	I've also got a program for checking for matches in the med schools. we need that program to match as many as possible without doing something complex like n grams... i think. if we do the ngrams, our program will take forever to run... although it may be feasible for just NC. 
2018-03-09 08:13:02	jesse	if you'd like to try to upgrade that program, feel free. 
2018-03-09 08:18:48	jesse	if you want to see those 2 programs, theyre in power6a under/home/jlsimps4/ForTheGreatAndPowerfulMichael/
2018-03-09 08:18:48		since michael was wanting to look into them.
2018-03-09 08:18:48		they require a database for the specialists and the pubmed stuff, so you can find those csvs in the ForMeaghan folder... to convert between the two, you can just use a psql \copy statement 
2018-03-09 19:23:01	Arun	Hey Jesse, I’m just checking out your messages. So comparing med schools, you have written a separate script? 
2018-03-09 19:24:02	Arun	And, you took the YetAnotherMedicalSchoolList from the already available specialist data ( that website you sent me previously) , I believe? 
2018-03-09 19:34:00	jesse	yep. the scripts are in the pubmed-crawler folder in the rarediseases repo 
2018-03-09 19:35:33	Arun	Okay I will look into it!  
2018-03-09 19:36:58	Arun	So, you want me to do which state does these universities/medical school come from eh?  
2018-03-09 19:38:46	jesse	yeah. preferably the two letter code. NC for north carolina. I asked sagar to look at the same thing so you may want to message him. And maybe put messages in the patientportalpeeps channel since I've had to repeat myself for both you and Sagar. 
2018-03-10 15:18:08	Arun	Alright I will talk to Sagar and check where he is 
2018-03-10 21:39:13	Arun	Hey. I checked with Sagar, he said he is good with doing that part. So, is there something else I could work on?  
2018-03-10 21:40:53	jesse	have you seen the script for the medschool comparisons ? 
2018-03-10 21:51:09	jesse	There are 2, getPhysicianPubmedConnection.py and compareMedSchools.py
2018-03-10 21:51:09		We are no longer deleting the duplicates from the pubmed dataset because we are keeping the disease ids with the articles... What this means is that it will take longer for the program  to run. We need to make it more efficient if possible.
2018-03-10 21:51:09		As for the second file, we need to do whatever we can to get more medical schools to match... this could be achieved by doing Ngrams or by removing more nonsense words. 
2018-03-10 21:51:09		and last of all, you can check if Janne needs help with the drug companies. I havent heard back from her.
2018-03-10 21:51:09		That is all I would know to do. There are also some issues you could look into on github. 
2018-03-10 21:55:19	jesse	Also stuff about Mesh terms when gathering the pubmed data... but I think we should hold off on that until we figure out  how to get these comparisons efficiently. [:+1:1] 
2018-03-11 14:39:29	Arun	I did check those scripts recently, but I will do go through it again today or tomorrow, to start looking into it. I will look at the compareMedSchools.py and see what we can we do it make it match better. 
2018-03-11 14:40:21	Arun	And yes, I will check with Janne too, and see if she is doing okay. 
2018-04-12 13:45:44	jesse	Hey Arun, in the meeting today, it seemed like you finished whatever you were doing, and the team wanted you to help me out with researching the Alternative Medicines. We don't really have any leads on that, just need to find out what sources are good for that and what we can scrape. 
2018-04-12 13:46:20	Arun	Hi Jesse, I was just about to ping you regarding the same  
2018-04-12 13:46:59	Arun	So, I need to look out for data on alternative medicines? 
2018-04-12 13:49:41	jesse	yep. do google searches, or whatever you can to build up a list of websites that we can scrape data from. 
2018-04-12 13:49:58	Arun	Yes, I can do that  
2018-04-12 13:51:01	jesse	I'll be doing the same thing, so let me know if you find anything, and I will let you know if I find anything. If we find something good enough to scrape, then we can focus on that, but for now, lets just get links. 
2018-04-12 15:08:33	Arun	Okaaay sure, sounds good  
2018-04-16 20:35:57	jesse	Hey Arun, have you been looking into alternative medicine resources? 
2018-04-17 03:47:28	Arun	Hey sorry Jesse, I was held up with my project work for the DevOps course and I am done with that just now. I will be working on it from today (Tuesday) evening  
2018-04-17 12:49:20	jesse	sorry I thought I responded to this. That's fine. I've found a few resources if you want me to give them to ya. However, I'm just trying to think about how we can turn that into something helpful to visitors of our websites, since terminology is very different in the herbal remedy world.

2018-04-20 21:42:42	Arun	I forgot to send you these links earlier. 
2018-04-20 21:43:08	Arun	Anyway, is the next step to check if the data from this website is scrap-able? 
2018-04-20 21:45:43	jesse	yeah. not just if its scrapable, but can we actually make a connection from the disease to the treatment or the symptoms to the treatment. I was looking into some other sites but the biggest issue Im finding is that the medical vocabulary doesnt match up with the herbal community vocabulary. 
2018-04-20 22:22:06	Arun	Oh yeah, that is there too. 
2018-04-20 22:22:34	Arun	We can try to do a mapping between the medical vocab and the herbal community vocab? 
2018-04-21 10:24:16	jesse	if you think thats possible, then yeah. I dont think it is. 
2018-04-23 09:15:25	jesse	I just checked out the megabionet resource which looks amazing! the only issue is the vocab problem. I'm in the lab now, and I might ask someone about it. 
2018-04-23 12:07:08	Arun	Megabionet? Can you share the link of it? I’ll just take a look at it  
2018-04-23 12:07:31	jesse	you linked it earlier. 
2018-04-23 12:08:17	Arun	Oh lol, sorry I didn’t remember the name of the links I sent you. Anyway, alright.  
2018-04-24 15:12:15	Arun	Hey, any updates on the mapping? You got any help from people at the lab? 
2018-04-24 15:13:01	jesse	no ive been handling other issues 
2018-04-26 17:11:06	Arun	Hi, any updates on that? I was looking up for links with the medical names, but I couldnt find any as such 
2018-04-26 17:13:55	Arun	I mean, I was looking for websites that has data with their medical names and not the herbal vocab, but I couldn't find anything useful. 
2018-04-26 17:18:11	jesse	nah, you would want to map the symptomatic words in the herbal data to organ systems and then map those organ systems to the phenotypes in the database. I havent done this yet.
2018-04-26 17:18:11		there might be other ways to do it manually though. 
2018-04-26 17:34:53	Arun	Okay, and Megan and co, are they okay doing this way? 
2018-04-26 17:54:15	jesse	they didn't say much. we can just do it and worry about their opinions later. 
2018-04-27 14:35:51	jesse	Hey Arun, I made a sample script that I'm going to push now for comparing herbal remedies to the phenotypes. obviously, we will need to find a way to refine the search than just checking if strings match, but itll at least give you something to work with.

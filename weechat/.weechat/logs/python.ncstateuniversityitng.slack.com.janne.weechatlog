2018-03-16 14:45:27		getting channel history...
2018-01-23 11:02:12	Janne	Hey jesse! I'm having trouble accessing power6a. I was wondering if I can get your help before consulting Meaghan. 
2018-01-23 11:02:42	jesse	Ahh good. I really dont wanna work on english right now :) 
2018-01-23 11:02:51	jesse	whats up? 
2018-01-23 11:03:33	Janne	I can't ssh into anything lol, I tried the passwords meaghan gave me but I've been denied permission everytime 
2018-01-23 11:04:08	jesse	youre prompted for a password? 
2018-01-23 11:05:06	Janne	Yeah for http://power6a.oscar.ncsu.edu (power6a.oscar.ncsu.edu) I am but for http://proxy.oscar.ncsu.edu (proxy.oscar.ncsu.edu) I am denied permision 
2018-01-23 11:05:12	Janne	Does it just log in for yours? 
2018-01-23 11:07:22	jesse	yep. Since I gave them my ssh key, all I need to do is run ssh oscar or ssh oscardb.... I also configured that command to connect to http://proxy.oscar.ncsu.edu (proxy.oscar.ncsu.edu)  and http://power6a.oscar.ncsu.edu (power6a.oscar.ncsu.edu) automatically 
2018-01-23 11:07:31	jesse	but no password prompt 
2018-01-23 11:07:39	Janne	yeahhhh that's not happening for me 
2018-01-23 11:07:57	jesse	so you can log into proxy but not power? 
2018-01-23 11:08:00	Janne	I gave her my ssh key but I think something is messed up in my set 
2018-01-23 11:08:06	Janne	I can't log into both 
2018-01-23 11:08:25	jesse	...did you give her your public key or private? 
2018-01-23 11:09:18	Janne	public 
2018-01-23 11:10:08	jesse	you should probably talk to meaghan then. 
2018-01-23 11:10:23	Janne	Oh i know what's happening, when I try to ssh my key that was used can't be found 
2018-01-23 11:10:40	jesse	is it not in the .ssh directory? 
2018-01-23 11:10:47	Janne	it is 
2018-01-23 11:11:05	Janne	but it the output logs when I ssh it doesn't know to search that key? 
2018-01-23 11:11:58	Janne	I'm in!!! :smile: 
2018-01-23 11:12:27	jesse	yeayy! 
2018-01-23 11:13:03	Janne	lol I'm sorry I bothered you 
2018-01-23 11:13:27	jesse	youre good. 
2018-01-23 14:32:27	jesse	Hey Janne, what are you currently working on as far as rare diseases? 
2018-01-23 15:01:46	Janne	I've been slacking on the organs but I'll get that done soon. I was also planning on starting to look at some of the websites we have to crawl, but I was hoping we could section out which websites each member was going to crawl before working on it. 
2018-01-23 15:09:30	jesse	I've been slacking  on this since Friday or something.  i was gonna start crawling  some time since yurika seems pretty simple. would you maybe wanna work on this some after plm? 
2018-01-23 15:26:16	Janne	Yeah sure! 
2018-01-23 15:26:39	jesse	cool! 
2018-01-23 17:49:09	jesse	wanna meet at the library? 
2018-01-23 18:06:41	jesse	Just noticed that there are some urls added with Yurika. I'm guessing you did that? I kinda expected that this would be running locally rather than one shared session between us. Since this is the case, do you think that we should run all of the links at once? 
2018-01-23 18:09:11	jesse	I'm also wondering if the output will be downloaded onto our system or if it will be saved onto their server/db. the latter may be problematic 
2018-01-23 18:13:45	Janne	I did not add them lol but I noticed that as well 
2018-01-23 18:13:59	jesse	it may have been me lol 
2018-01-23 18:14:24	Janne	lol how did that happen? were you able to use Yurika already? (outside of the web version) 
2018-01-23 18:14:53	jesse	pretty sure the web version is the only version 
2018-01-23 18:24:00	Janne	oh lol ohk :sweat_smile: 
2018-01-23 18:25:13	jesse	this things weird. 
2018-01-23 18:29:16	jesse	it seems like you have to know exactly what you want before you start scraping... usually, I would think you would want to get everything downloaded first and then start filtering. 
2018-01-23 18:31:08	jesse	ok so I put a blank mindmap and a query for 'pregnancy'. shall I run the thing and see what happens? 
2018-01-23 18:34:46	jesse	ok so nothing happened... not really surprised lol... is there something we could be doing that doesn't involve yurika? I'm thinkin we should just leave this for after thursdays meeting when they are gonna teach us the thing. [:+1::skin-tone-4:1] 
2018-01-23 18:48:27	jesse	should I go and make the databases? or does more stuff need to be done with the CSV's ? 
2018-01-23 21:41:34	Janne	Oh yeah we do have access to the database? 
2018-01-23 21:41:45	Janne	Oh where can we access the db btw? 
2018-01-23 21:42:00	Janne	Ummm idk if we should just yet 
2018-01-23 21:42:25	jesse	which one? 
2018-01-23 21:43:56	jesse	we have to make the databases for the hospitals and specialists. We have access to a few others but they don't have much important information for our part of the project 
2018-01-23 21:44:24	Janne	i guess the ones currently available 
2018-01-23 21:44:57	Janne	i know we do but i'm not sure if we have the schemas for all the tables yet (hospital and or specialists), or do we? 
2018-01-23 21:46:04	jesse	We don't have a set schema, it would just be whatever is on the csv's. 
2018-01-23 21:46:46	Janne	i figured, we haven't cleaned the other medical facilities yet right? 
2018-01-23 21:47:15	jesse	correct. 
2018-01-23 21:48:44	jesse	I didn't have permission to modify the google sheets so I couldn't do that. 
2018-01-23 21:49:56	Janne	oh ohk that's weird, I can try to give you access? 
2018-01-23 21:50:03	Janne	idk why that keeps happening 
2018-01-23 21:51:42	jesse	I'm not sure. I'll see if theres a way to fix it. 
2018-01-23 21:52:18	Janne	oh wait, did you say you're not using your ncsu acct? 
2018-01-23 21:52:33	jesse	i made the folder... that shouldnt matter 
2018-01-23 21:52:49	Janne	oh you right 
2018-01-23 21:53:18	Janne	which ones can't you acces? 
2018-01-23 21:53:21	Janne	access* 
2018-01-23 21:53:41	Janne	@Janne uploaded a file: https://ncstateuniversityitng.slack.com/files/U8QQDGG2C/F8X2Z0TG9/screen_shot_2018-01-23_at_9.53.11_pm.png (Screen Shot 2018-01-23 at 9.53.11 PM.png) 
2018-01-23 21:54:42	jesse	ahh maybe i was signed in as my ncsu account 
2018-01-23 21:54:59	jesse	i can edit now 
2018-01-23 21:55:50	Janne	yayyyy :smile: 
2018-01-23 21:56:23	jesse	so get this... im signed in as jesse.simpson and when I click a link, it says I'm jlsimps4... 
2018-01-23 21:56:29	Janne	can you note down which columns you remove if you remove any? 
2018-01-23 21:56:35	Janne	lol what link? 
2018-01-23 21:56:48	jesse	any spreadsheet... then I have to manually change the accounts 
2018-01-23 21:58:34	jesse	but yeah I can note down the columns I remove. Honestly, I'm thinkin about just modeling them all after the hospital one and making one ginormous table out of it. 
2018-01-23 21:59:02	Janne	That's what I wanted to do to, but there's seriously a lot more columns in some of the other tables 
2018-01-23 21:59:32	jesse	well we can keep them in separate tables then. 
2018-01-23 21:59:53	jesse	we don't even know how these are going to be used anyway :disappointed: 
2018-01-23 22:00:00	Janne	Sorry for reiterating this but I just want to make sure we aren't deleting any possible data that we don't know that meaning to 
2018-01-23 22:00:06	Janne	Exactly 
2018-01-23 22:00:35	Janne	it would be nice to have a better description that just "rare diseases" lol 
2018-01-23 22:00:40	Janne	it would help a lottt 
2018-01-23 22:01:33	jesse	yeah. We may get that after the meeting with the real people. 
2018-01-23 22:01:58	Janne	i can't go to that meeting :tired_face: 
2018-01-23 22:02:03	Janne	I have class during that time 
2018-01-23 22:02:45	jesse	shoot thats during PLM isn't it?! 
2018-01-23 22:03:54	Janne	yeahhh im pretty sure 
2018-01-23 22:04:08	jesse	Dang!! 
2018-01-23 22:04:20	Janne	I wish I could skip that class, but I cant risk it 
2018-01-23 22:05:42	jesse	it doesn't seem like a hard class, but since its team based, I don't wanna mess up my other team members. 
2018-01-23 22:09:41	jesse	ya know we could just keep all the columns as they are and just query for whatever we need. It's a little bit of a waste in memory tho 
2018-01-23 22:10:16	Janne	yeahh that's what we have to think about 
2018-01-23 22:12:19	jesse	If we keep all of the columns that we don't fully understand... then we are only able to remove columns that don't have a purpose (such as a column with the same value for every entry)... and there aren't many of those 
2018-01-23 22:15:07	jesse	website and ownership are both not available for every entry in nursing homes but in a way, it could be useful to know what information we would not be able to extract... but more than likely, its worthless data 
2018-01-23 22:20:17	jesse	As for the things we are unsure about; if we are unsure about what the data is, then I would imagine that kowolenko wouldn't understand either since he isn't a medical professional.. and then we wouldn't be able to use that data anyway. So we could go for the conservative approach or the trim everything approach. I think its best to keep everything until we know how hospitals and specialists will be used in the system. Its possible that most of this data is irrelevant anyway. [:+1::skin-tone-4:1] 
2018-01-23 22:23:50	jesse	Something more concerning is the fact that we don't yet have a way to match each specialist to a particular hospital... I'm looking at the specialist table now and those columns are mostly blank 
2018-01-30 20:07:42	jesse	Hey Janne, I found a table if ya wanted to join. Im on the 3rd floor. as you come up the stairs, just take a u turn on your left. 
2018-02-04 15:19:54	jesse	Hey Janne, do you have an idea of what you're gonna try to get done for raredx stuff this week? 
2018-02-04 15:20:35	Janne	As of right now I'm creating the attributes from tehrare dx companies to filter into yurika and my own crawler 
2018-02-04 15:20:56	Janne	Also that's what I'll mostly be using to create some sort of table of data 
2018-02-04 15:21:16	jesse	by raredx companies do you mean the list of pharmacies and whatever kowolenko sent us? 
2018-02-04 15:25:00	jesse	Also, I was considering asking meaghan if she could handle the AgensGraph/gephi stuff since Sagar won't be available... but I'm not too sure yet since I may have time to figure that out. 
2018-02-04 15:25:29	Janne	Yeah that's what I meant :slightly_smiling_face: 
2018-02-04 15:25:47	Janne	After I creating my basic tables I was also thinking of tackling that stuff 
2018-02-04 15:25:56	Janne	have you made any progress on that? 
2018-02-04 15:27:35	jesse	not really. I just installed the two programs... its a lil screwy cuz you have to uninstall postgresql for it to work... I think I'm going to try to extract the specialists relation to rare diseases from the pubmed website. and maybe i'll come back to that. 
2018-02-04 15:28:07	Janne	What I'm thinking is that we if we can find some way to have the gephi application work on our application we can import the data from our database as GEXF files. https://gephi.org/users/supported-graph-formats/ 
2018-02-04 15:31:10	Janne	Do you know who uploaded the list_of_rare_dx in our RareDiseases folder? 
2018-02-04 15:32:42	jesse	is that the one that starts with acquired hemophilia? 
2018-02-04 15:32:52	Janne	Yuppp 
2018-02-04 15:33:36	jesse	me. I took that from nords website with curl and used grep to filter the nonsense 
2018-02-04 15:43:33	Janne	Oh ohk. Dr. Kowolenko said that he created the rare diseases table using the data from NORD and GARD. 
2018-02-04 15:44:32	Janne	The disease_names_genes table contains around 30,000 specific diseases. If you want a more extensive list :slightly_smiling_face: 
2018-02-04 15:44:52	Janne	I'm thinking of just connecting to it in my python script to read it. 
2018-02-04 15:45:50	Janne	But in my opinion i think the table in the NCBI database is kinda organized funny. We haven't really be briefed about the whole structured so maybe if we had one we'll get a better understanding. 
2018-02-04 15:46:05	Janne	Thanks for uploading that list! 
2018-02-04 15:49:03	jesse	is that table what dr. kowolenko meant when he mentioned he made a list of the diseases? 
2018-02-04 15:50:06	Janne	There are several "disease" tables in the ncbi database but that one (disease_names...) is the only one I found where the "disease" column has actual disease values. 
2018-02-04 15:50:19	Janne	Other tabled like the pubmed db has a giant description of the database 
2018-02-04 15:51:05	jesse	qjk 
2018-02-04 15:51:13	jesse	didn't mean to send that lol 
2018-02-04 15:51:18	Janne	lololol 
2018-02-04 15:51:30	jesse	trying to do psql stuff in the terminal haha 
2018-02-04 16:13:57	jesse	the issue with the bigger lists of rare diseases is that I cant make yurika crawl 30,000 websites and the websites those queries link to... 
2018-02-04 16:14:46	Janne	true, but another argument is that you might miss some rare diseases 
2018-02-04 16:15:05	Janne	We can always section up the data we use in the crawler 
2018-02-04 16:15:16	Janne	Are you thinking of using your own crawler as well? 
2018-02-04 16:18:36	jesse	I'm using my instance of yurika right now. I might make my own script to specifically search for the authors of each article on pubmed. 
2018-02-04 16:20:45	jesse	its kinda complicated, trying to match up the rare disease to the specialist... and even when I get the information, I'll have no idea if that info is reliable since there are many people with the same name in the US. 
2018-02-04 16:22:51	jesse	maybe I can make a dictionary of the specialists and search on that dictionary with the queries of rare-dx's .... but that would be over 30,000 names 
2018-02-04 16:25:04	jesse	I feel really incompetent when it comes to this project  (-_-) 
2018-02-04 18:32:02	Janne	Me too :tired_face: 
2018-02-04 18:32:09	Janne	Are you running Yurika rn? 
2018-02-04 18:32:29	jesse	no 
2018-02-05 09:33:26	jesse	Let me know if you get around to trying to do the gephi/agensgraph stuff... i had a few dependency issues when I was trying to install and run it 
2018-02-05 12:23:25	Janne	Ohk :slightly_smiling_face: I probably wont be working on it until tomorrow. 
2018-02-05 12:23:33	Janne	Mainly working on Senior Design today 
2018-02-05 12:24:28	jesse	I gotcha. I probably won't do much of this today either. I'm getting kinda tired lol 
2018-02-05 15:10:39	Janne	Me too :disappointed: 
2018-02-05 15:10:47	Janne	But we can totally do this!! 
2018-02-05 21:19:49	jesse	@jesse uploaded a file: https://ncstateuniversityitng.slack.com/files/U8QQFV2GG/F94B5D9EE/sample_data_to_convert_to_csv.js (sample data to convert to csv) and commented: Hey Janne... I've got this big text file filled with rare disease info, and specialist name, but I'm kinda blanking on what the best way to process it. Could you take a look? each entry in the txt file looks like this... 
2018-02-05 21:23:50	jesse	I'd like to make a dataframe out of it all but theres multiple authors and multiple author locations which makes it confusing. 
2018-02-05 21:30:40	jesse	I think I got it. im just bein dumb. 
2018-02-06 08:18:41	Janne	I thought I ad sent this yesterday: "Yeah sure! I won't be working on this until tomorrow though :disappointed: I have a senior design tonight" 
2018-02-06 09:43:40	jesse	thats ok. i made a csv out of it. its ugly tho 
2018-02-07 19:25:40	Janne	Ohk I'm getting really frustrated at Sagar rn lol 
2018-02-07 19:31:56	jesse	whys that? im not lookin at the messages rn, im doin laundry 
2018-02-07 19:34:00	Janne	Lol it's all good. He's helping now but literally I was asking him for an example of one line of code and he gave me references to things I had that didn't have. But it's all good now lol I was getting frustrated for a little bit 
2018-02-07 19:36:29	jesse	gotcha. i tried understanding the question but I don't really understand the context. Glad it worked out. 
2018-02-11 09:13:30	jesse	Hey Janne, do you understand the PLM homework? 
2018-02-12 10:06:57	Janne	Hey! Sorry for the late response. No i dont really understand what's going on. 
2018-02-12 10:07:17	Janne	But i saw Alex Phelp's post 
2018-02-12 10:07:28	Janne	I think that'll help but I haven't read it yet 
2018-02-12 10:08:21	jesse	oh thats ok. i saw that too. i ended up just doing something that looks like it could be right and submitting it... i spent too much time trying to interpret it. 
2018-02-13 10:08:12	Janne	Rightt I'm on that problem now. 
2018-02-13 10:08:26	Janne	Do you think you have any time to meet before class starts? 
2018-02-13 10:09:10	jesse	about raredx stuff or the plm homework? 
2018-02-13 10:33:26	jesse	not that it changes my answer. I can meet up, but I wont be much use to you for the plm assignment 
2018-02-13 10:45:44	jesse	Just let me know if ya want to meet. I'm available all day except for plm class time. [:+1::skin-tone-4:1] 
2018-02-13 13:17:18	jesse	Hey Janne, how is crawling the drug companies going? and how is linking specialists with raredx from pubmed? 
2018-02-13 13:21:37	Janne	Can we meet after my senior design class? We get out around 2:40PM 
2018-02-13 13:21:44	jesse	Sure thing 
2018-02-13 14:44:34	jesse	I have a table on the 3rd floor behind the printers 
2018-02-15 13:10:10	jesse	Did you retain a lot of the last PLM lecture? All that stuff went completely over my head lol. 
2018-02-15 13:10:49	jesse	I'm looking over Menzies notes now 
2018-02-18 16:05:11	jesse	Hey Janne, I got to a point with the pubmed data where I gave the rest of the work to Arun and I'm free to do other things. How is the drug company stuff going? 
2018-02-18 17:14:30	jesse	Let me know if you want me to help. As for the pubmed data, I got the script to make a CSV. its about a gigabyte big and is mildly buggy so I let Arun handle it since there isn't a whole lot of work to do now that the CSV is populating. 
2018-02-19 08:32:00	Janne	Hey there! Would you be down to work on DrugCo later today? 
2018-02-19 09:23:08	jesse	I'll be free after 5pm. I've got some classes on main on Monday/Wednesday. 
2018-02-19 10:47:26	Janne	I can do after 5 on main :slightly_smiling_face: 
2018-02-19 10:48:36	jesse	ok. If it's on main, I'll be available as soon as 4:15 and will also be available 1 - 3 (but i usually use that time for homework.) 
2018-02-19 15:01:09	Janne	Would you want to work on Main or Hunt? 
2018-02-19 15:01:21	Janne	I can be there after 5. Better parking for both options :slightly_smiling_face: 
2018-02-19 15:42:20	jesse	I can be at either places. My preference would probably be hunt though 
2018-02-19 16:22:57	Janne	That's fine with me too! So I'm in durham and its about rush hour :expressionless: would it be cool if we meet closer to 6:-6:30 when the traffic has died. 
2018-02-19 16:35:52	jesse	Sounds good! I'm making dinner now so I was actually just about to text you that id be late 
2018-02-19 20:32:18	jesse	Hey Janne, I found a website you've probably already seen, but i'll share it anyway. https://clinicaltrials.gov for the clinical trials.  It wouldn't help with the other information we need though.
2018-02-19 20:32:18		Home - ClinicalTrials.gov 
2018-02-19 22:22:55	jesse	One of my group member completed his role of implementing crazy eight. so happy. pretty sure the solitaire guy hasnt started though. still though. its a nice feeling. Good luck with your group's meeting. 
2018-02-19 22:26:18	jesse	And my part of the project is almost done :slightly_smiling_face: 
2018-02-19 22:36:31	jesse	Oh, and Arun got back to me saying he can run stuff in yurika. I told him to contact you. Id be free to meet up again tomorrow after class or Wednesday night if you think i could be of assistance for anything drug company related... but i felt pretty worthless today haha. 
2018-02-19 22:36:31		If Arun's yurika thing doesn't work out, we should tell Meaghan we are struggling with the drug companies. 
2018-02-21 16:20:46	jesse	let me know if there's anything i can do to help with the pharma stuff. (if you're working on that.). i reached this strange point where all my homework is done and have nothing else to do but drink tea xD

2018-02-23 07:47:39	jesse	hey Janne, id be free to meet today before 4:30 if ya wanna do raredx stuff.  
2018-02-23 07:56:37	jesse	though that may be difficult if you need to park somewhere 
2018-02-23 13:08:48	Janne	Hey Jesse! I actually can't meet today. I just realized I have a test for my other class that I haven't studied for. That's my main priority today :disappointed: 
2018-02-23 13:22:05	jesse	that's alright. ive been doing other stuff anyway.  btw I'm not sure if i would use that lisp video you sent. The lisp that menzies is having us learn is kinda different than regular lisp. 
2018-02-23 15:22:14	Janne	Awww ohk /: 
2018-02-23 15:22:20	Janne	Yeah I haven't watched that video yet 
2018-02-23 15:22:29	Janne	Guess I need to just read the pdf he has on the site 
2018-02-23 15:41:16	jesse	i watched the first half of the video. it's pretty good and helped me get used to some of the look and feel for lisp as well as a few added functions that are nice to know.
2018-02-23 15:41:16		that pdf is what test questions will come from though... and that syntax is kinda different... some of it isn't even valid lisp such as the "label" function. 
2018-02-28 19:07:57	Janne	Hey there! Would you happen to know where the LISP pdf is? 
2018-02-28 19:25:52	jesse	i think i can find it.

2018-01-23 11:02:12	Janne	Hey jesse! I'm having trouble accessing power6a. I was wondering if I can get your help before consulting Meaghan. 
2018-01-23 11:02:42	jesse	Ahh good. I really dont wanna work on english right now :) 
2018-01-23 11:02:51	jesse	whats up? 
2018-01-23 11:03:33	Janne	I can't ssh into anything lol, I tried the passwords meaghan gave me but I've been denied permission everytime 
2018-01-23 11:04:08	jesse	youre prompted for a password? 
2018-01-23 11:05:06	Janne	Yeah for http://power6a.oscar.ncsu.edu (power6a.oscar.ncsu.edu) I am but for http://proxy.oscar.ncsu.edu (proxy.oscar.ncsu.edu) I am denied permision 
2018-01-23 11:05:12	Janne	Does it just log in for yours? 
2018-01-23 11:07:22	jesse	yep. Since I gave them my ssh key, all I need to do is run ssh oscar or ssh oscardb.... I also configured that command to connect to http://proxy.oscar.ncsu.edu (proxy.oscar.ncsu.edu)  and http://power6a.oscar.ncsu.edu (power6a.oscar.ncsu.edu) automatically 
2018-01-23 11:07:31	jesse	but no password prompt 
2018-01-23 11:07:39	Janne	yeahhhh that's not happening for me 
2018-01-23 11:07:57	jesse	so you can log into proxy but not power? 
2018-01-23 11:08:00	Janne	I gave her my ssh key but I think something is messed up in my set 
2018-01-23 11:08:06	Janne	I can't log into both 
2018-01-23 11:08:25	jesse	...did you give her your public key or private? 
2018-01-23 11:09:18	Janne	public 
2018-01-23 11:10:08	jesse	you should probably talk to meaghan then. 
2018-01-23 11:10:23	Janne	Oh i know what's happening, when I try to ssh my key that was used can't be found 
2018-01-23 11:10:40	jesse	is it not in the .ssh directory? 
2018-01-23 11:10:47	Janne	it is 
2018-01-23 11:11:05	Janne	but it the output logs when I ssh it doesn't know to search that key? 
2018-01-23 11:11:58	Janne	I'm in!!! :smile: 
2018-01-23 11:12:27	jesse	yeayy! 
2018-01-23 11:13:03	Janne	lol I'm sorry I bothered you 
2018-01-23 11:13:27	jesse	youre good. 
2018-01-23 14:32:27	jesse	Hey Janne, what are you currently working on as far as rare diseases? 
2018-01-23 15:01:46	Janne	I've been slacking on the organs but I'll get that done soon. I was also planning on starting to look at some of the websites we have to crawl, but I was hoping we could section out which websites each member was going to crawl before working on it. 
2018-01-23 15:09:30	jesse	I've been slacking  on this since Friday or something.  i was gonna start crawling  some time since yurika seems pretty simple. would you maybe wanna work on this some after plm? 
2018-01-23 15:26:16	Janne	Yeah sure! 
2018-01-23 15:26:39	jesse	cool! 
2018-01-23 17:49:09	jesse	wanna meet at the library? 
2018-01-23 18:06:41	jesse	Just noticed that there are some urls added with Yurika. I'm guessing you did that? I kinda expected that this would be running locally rather than one shared session between us. Since this is the case, do you think that we should run all of the links at once? 
2018-01-23 18:09:11	jesse	I'm also wondering if the output will be downloaded onto our system or if it will be saved onto their server/db. the latter may be problematic 
2018-01-23 18:13:45	Janne	I did not add them lol but I noticed that as well 
2018-01-23 18:13:59	jesse	it may have been me lol 
2018-01-23 18:14:24	Janne	lol how did that happen? were you able to use Yurika already? (outside of the web version) 
2018-01-23 18:14:53	jesse	pretty sure the web version is the only version 
2018-01-23 18:24:00	Janne	oh lol ohk :sweat_smile: 
2018-01-23 18:25:13	jesse	this things weird. 
2018-01-23 18:29:16	jesse	it seems like you have to know exactly what you want before you start scraping... usually, I would think you would want to get everything downloaded first and then start filtering. 
2018-01-23 18:31:08	jesse	ok so I put a blank mindmap and a query for 'pregnancy'. shall I run the thing and see what happens? 
2018-01-23 18:34:46	jesse	ok so nothing happened... not really surprised lol... is there something we could be doing that doesn't involve yurika? I'm thinkin we should just leave this for after thursdays meeting when they are gonna teach us the thing. [:+1::skin-tone-4:1] 
2018-01-23 18:48:27	jesse	should I go and make the databases? or does more stuff need to be done with the CSV's ? 
2018-01-23 21:41:34	Janne	Oh yeah we do have access to the database? 
2018-01-23 21:41:45	Janne	Oh where can we access the db btw? 
2018-01-23 21:42:00	Janne	Ummm idk if we should just yet 
2018-01-23 21:42:25	jesse	which one? 
2018-01-23 21:43:56	jesse	we have to make the databases for the hospitals and specialists. We have access to a few others but they don't have much important information for our part of the project 
2018-01-23 21:44:24	Janne	i guess the ones currently available 
2018-01-23 21:44:57	Janne	i know we do but i'm not sure if we have the schemas for all the tables yet (hospital and or specialists), or do we? 
2018-01-23 21:46:04	jesse	We don't have a set schema, it would just be whatever is on the csv's. 
2018-01-23 21:46:46	Janne	i figured, we haven't cleaned the other medical facilities yet right? 
2018-01-23 21:47:15	jesse	correct. 
2018-01-23 21:48:44	jesse	I didn't have permission to modify the google sheets so I couldn't do that. 
2018-01-23 21:49:56	Janne	oh ohk that's weird, I can try to give you access? 
2018-01-23 21:50:03	Janne	idk why that keeps happening 
2018-01-23 21:51:42	jesse	I'm not sure. I'll see if theres a way to fix it. 
2018-01-23 21:52:18	Janne	oh wait, did you say you're not using your ncsu acct? 
2018-01-23 21:52:33	jesse	i made the folder... that shouldnt matter 
2018-01-23 21:52:49	Janne	oh you right 
2018-01-23 21:53:18	Janne	which ones can't you acces? 
2018-01-23 21:53:21	Janne	access* 
2018-01-23 21:53:41	Janne	@Janne uploaded a file: https://ncstateuniversityitng.slack.com/files/U8QQDGG2C/F8X2Z0TG9/screen_shot_2018-01-23_at_9.53.11_pm.png (Screen Shot 2018-01-23 at 9.53.11 PM.png) 
2018-01-23 21:54:42	jesse	ahh maybe i was signed in as my ncsu account 
2018-01-23 21:54:59	jesse	i can edit now 
2018-01-23 21:55:50	Janne	yayyyy :smile: 
2018-01-23 21:56:23	jesse	so get this... im signed in as jesse.simpson and when I click a link, it says I'm jlsimps4... 
2018-01-23 21:56:29	Janne	can you note down which columns you remove if you remove any? 
2018-01-23 21:56:35	Janne	lol what link? 
2018-01-23 21:56:48	jesse	any spreadsheet... then I have to manually change the accounts 
2018-01-23 21:58:34	jesse	but yeah I can note down the columns I remove. Honestly, I'm thinkin about just modeling them all after the hospital one and making one ginormous table out of it. 
2018-01-23 21:59:02	Janne	That's what I wanted to do to, but there's seriously a lot more columns in some of the other tables 
2018-01-23 21:59:32	jesse	well we can keep them in separate tables then. 
2018-01-23 21:59:53	jesse	we don't even know how these are going to be used anyway :disappointed: 
2018-01-23 22:00:00	Janne	Sorry for reiterating this but I just want to make sure we aren't deleting any possible data that we don't know that meaning to 
2018-01-23 22:00:06	Janne	Exactly 
2018-01-23 22:00:35	Janne	it would be nice to have a better description that just "rare diseases" lol 
2018-01-23 22:00:40	Janne	it would help a lottt 
2018-01-23 22:01:33	jesse	yeah. We may get that after the meeting with the real people. 
2018-01-23 22:01:58	Janne	i can't go to that meeting :tired_face: 
2018-01-23 22:02:03	Janne	I have class during that time 
2018-01-23 22:02:45	jesse	shoot thats during PLM isn't it?! 
2018-01-23 22:03:54	Janne	yeahhh im pretty sure 
2018-01-23 22:04:08	jesse	Dang!! 
2018-01-23 22:04:20	Janne	I wish I could skip that class, but I cant risk it 
2018-01-23 22:05:42	jesse	it doesn't seem like a hard class, but since its team based, I don't wanna mess up my other team members. 
2018-01-23 22:09:41	jesse	ya know we could just keep all the columns as they are and just query for whatever we need. It's a little bit of a waste in memory tho 
2018-01-23 22:10:16	Janne	yeahh that's what we have to think about 
2018-01-23 22:12:19	jesse	If we keep all of the columns that we don't fully understand... then we are only able to remove columns that don't have a purpose (such as a column with the same value for every entry)... and there aren't many of those 
2018-01-23 22:15:07	jesse	website and ownership are both not available for every entry in nursing homes but in a way, it could be useful to know what information we would not be able to extract... but more than likely, its worthless data 
2018-01-23 22:20:17	jesse	As for the things we are unsure about; if we are unsure about what the data is, then I would imagine that kowolenko wouldn't understand either since he isn't a medical professional.. and then we wouldn't be able to use that data anyway. So we could go for the conservative approach or the trim everything approach. I think its best to keep everything until we know how hospitals and specialists will be used in the system. Its possible that most of this data is irrelevant anyway. [:+1::skin-tone-4:1] 
2018-01-23 22:23:50	jesse	Something more concerning is the fact that we don't yet have a way to match each specialist to a particular hospital... I'm looking at the specialist table now and those columns are mostly blank 
2018-01-30 20:07:42	jesse	Hey Janne, I found a table if ya wanted to join. Im on the 3rd floor. as you come up the stairs, just take a u turn on your left. 
2018-02-04 15:19:54	jesse	Hey Janne, do you have an idea of what you're gonna try to get done for raredx stuff this week? 
2018-02-04 15:20:35	Janne	As of right now I'm creating the attributes from tehrare dx companies to filter into yurika and my own crawler 
2018-02-04 15:20:56	Janne	Also that's what I'll mostly be using to create some sort of table of data 
2018-02-04 15:21:16	jesse	by raredx companies do you mean the list of pharmacies and whatever kowolenko sent us? 
2018-02-04 15:25:00	jesse	Also, I was considering asking meaghan if she could handle the AgensGraph/gephi stuff since Sagar won't be available... but I'm not too sure yet since I may have time to figure that out. 
2018-02-04 15:25:29	Janne	Yeah that's what I meant :slightly_smiling_face: 
2018-02-04 15:25:47	Janne	After I creating my basic tables I was also thinking of tackling that stuff 
2018-02-04 15:25:56	Janne	have you made any progress on that? 
2018-02-04 15:27:35	jesse	not really. I just installed the two programs... its a lil screwy cuz you have to uninstall postgresql for it to work... I think I'm going to try to extract the specialists relation to rare diseases from the pubmed website. and maybe i'll come back to that. 
2018-02-04 15:28:07	Janne	What I'm thinking is that we if we can find some way to have the gephi application work on our application we can import the data from our database as GEXF files. https://gephi.org/users/supported-graph-formats/ 
2018-02-04 15:31:10	Janne	Do you know who uploaded the list_of_rare_dx in our RareDiseases folder? 
2018-02-04 15:32:42	jesse	is that the one that starts with acquired hemophilia? 
2018-02-04 15:32:52	Janne	Yuppp 
2018-02-04 15:33:36	jesse	me. I took that from nords website with curl and used grep to filter the nonsense 
2018-02-04 15:43:33	Janne	Oh ohk. Dr. Kowolenko said that he created the rare diseases table using the data from NORD and GARD. 
2018-02-04 15:44:32	Janne	The disease_names_genes table contains around 30,000 specific diseases. If you want a more extensive list :slightly_smiling_face: 
2018-02-04 15:44:52	Janne	I'm thinking of just connecting to it in my python script to read it. 
2018-02-04 15:45:50	Janne	But in my opinion i think the table in the NCBI database is kinda organized funny. We haven't really be briefed about the whole structured so maybe if we had one we'll get a better understanding. 
2018-02-04 15:46:05	Janne	Thanks for uploading that list! 
2018-02-04 15:49:03	jesse	is that table what dr. kowolenko meant when he mentioned he made a list of the diseases? 
2018-02-04 15:50:06	Janne	There are several "disease" tables in the ncbi database but that one (disease_names...) is the only one I found where the "disease" column has actual disease values. 
2018-02-04 15:50:19	Janne	Other tabled like the pubmed db has a giant description of the database 
2018-02-04 15:51:05	jesse	qjk 
2018-02-04 15:51:13	jesse	didn't mean to send that lol 
2018-02-04 15:51:18	Janne	lololol 
2018-02-04 15:51:30	jesse	trying to do psql stuff in the terminal haha 
2018-02-04 16:13:57	jesse	the issue with the bigger lists of rare diseases is that I cant make yurika crawl 30,000 websites and the websites those queries link to... 
2018-02-04 16:14:46	Janne	true, but another argument is that you might miss some rare diseases 
2018-02-04 16:15:05	Janne	We can always section up the data we use in the crawler 
2018-02-04 16:15:16	Janne	Are you thinking of using your own crawler as well? 
2018-02-04 16:18:36	jesse	I'm using my instance of yurika right now. I might make my own script to specifically search for the authors of each article on pubmed. 
2018-02-04 16:20:45	jesse	its kinda complicated, trying to match up the rare disease to the specialist... and even when I get the information, I'll have no idea if that info is reliable since there are many people with the same name in the US. 
2018-02-04 16:22:51	jesse	maybe I can make a dictionary of the specialists and search on that dictionary with the queries of rare-dx's .... but that would be over 30,000 names 
2018-02-04 16:25:04	jesse	I feel really incompetent when it comes to this project  (-_-) 
2018-02-04 18:32:02	Janne	Me too :tired_face: 
2018-02-04 18:32:09	Janne	Are you running Yurika rn? 
2018-02-04 18:32:29	jesse	no 
2018-02-05 09:33:26	jesse	Let me know if you get around to trying to do the gephi/agensgraph stuff... i had a few dependency issues when I was trying to install and run it 
2018-02-05 12:23:25	Janne	Ohk :slightly_smiling_face: I probably wont be working on it until tomorrow. 
2018-02-05 12:23:33	Janne	Mainly working on Senior Design today 
2018-02-05 12:24:28	jesse	I gotcha. I probably won't do much of this today either. I'm getting kinda tired lol 
2018-02-05 15:10:39	Janne	Me too :disappointed: 
2018-02-05 15:10:47	Janne	But we can totally do this!! 
2018-02-05 21:19:49	jesse	@jesse uploaded a file: https://ncstateuniversityitng.slack.com/files/U8QQFV2GG/F94B5D9EE/sample_data_to_convert_to_csv.js (sample data to convert to csv) and commented: Hey Janne... I've got this big text file filled with rare disease info, and specialist name, but I'm kinda blanking on what the best way to process it. Could you take a look? each entry in the txt file looks like this... 
2018-02-05 21:23:50	jesse	I'd like to make a dataframe out of it all but theres multiple authors and multiple author locations which makes it confusing. 
2018-02-05 21:30:40	jesse	I think I got it. im just bein dumb. 
2018-02-06 08:18:41	Janne	I thought I ad sent this yesterday: "Yeah sure! I won't be working on this until tomorrow though :disappointed: I have a senior design tonight" 
2018-02-06 09:43:40	jesse	thats ok. i made a csv out of it. its ugly tho 
2018-02-07 19:25:40	Janne	Ohk I'm getting really frustrated at Sagar rn lol 
2018-02-07 19:31:56	jesse	whys that? im not lookin at the messages rn, im doin laundry 
2018-02-07 19:34:00	Janne	Lol it's all good. He's helping now but literally I was asking him for an example of one line of code and he gave me references to things I had that didn't have. But it's all good now lol I was getting frustrated for a little bit 
2018-02-07 19:36:29	jesse	gotcha. i tried understanding the question but I don't really understand the context. Glad it worked out. 
2018-02-11 09:13:30	jesse	Hey Janne, do you understand the PLM homework? 
2018-02-12 10:06:57	Janne	Hey! Sorry for the late response. No i dont really understand what's going on. 
2018-02-12 10:07:17	Janne	But i saw Alex Phelp's post 
2018-02-12 10:07:28	Janne	I think that'll help but I haven't read it yet 
2018-02-12 10:08:21	jesse	oh thats ok. i saw that too. i ended up just doing something that looks like it could be right and submitting it... i spent too much time trying to interpret it. 
2018-02-13 10:08:12	Janne	Rightt I'm on that problem now. 
2018-02-13 10:08:26	Janne	Do you think you have any time to meet before class starts? 
2018-02-13 10:09:10	jesse	about raredx stuff or the plm homework? 
2018-02-13 10:33:26	jesse	not that it changes my answer. I can meet up, but I wont be much use to you for the plm assignment 
2018-02-13 10:45:44	jesse	Just let me know if ya want to meet. I'm available all day except for plm class time. [:+1::skin-tone-4:1] 
2018-02-13 13:17:18	jesse	Hey Janne, how is crawling the drug companies going? and how is linking specialists with raredx from pubmed? 
2018-02-13 13:21:37	Janne	Can we meet after my senior design class? We get out around 2:40PM 
2018-02-13 13:21:44	jesse	Sure thing 
2018-02-13 14:44:34	jesse	I have a table on the 3rd floor behind the printers 
2018-02-15 13:10:10	jesse	Did you retain a lot of the last PLM lecture? All that stuff went completely over my head lol. 
2018-02-15 13:10:49	jesse	I'm looking over Menzies notes now 
2018-02-18 16:05:11	jesse	Hey Janne, I got to a point with the pubmed data where I gave the rest of the work to Arun and I'm free to do other things. How is the drug company stuff going? 
2018-02-18 17:14:30	jesse	Let me know if you want me to help. As for the pubmed data, I got the script to make a CSV. its about a gigabyte big and is mildly buggy so I let Arun handle it since there isn't a whole lot of work to do now that the CSV is populating. 
2018-02-19 08:32:00	Janne	Hey there! Would you be down to work on DrugCo later today? 
2018-02-19 09:23:08	jesse	I'll be free after 5pm. I've got some classes on main on Monday/Wednesday. 
2018-02-19 10:47:26	Janne	I can do after 5 on main :slightly_smiling_face: 
2018-02-19 10:48:36	jesse	ok. If it's on main, I'll be available as soon as 4:15 and will also be available 1 - 3 (but i usually use that time for homework.) 
2018-02-19 15:01:09	Janne	Would you want to work on Main or Hunt? 
2018-02-19 15:01:21	Janne	I can be there after 5. Better parking for both options :slightly_smiling_face: 
2018-02-19 15:42:20	jesse	I can be at either places. My preference would probably be hunt though 
2018-02-19 16:22:57	Janne	That's fine with me too! So I'm in durham and its about rush hour :expressionless: would it be cool if we meet closer to 6:-6:30 when the traffic has died. 
2018-02-19 16:35:52	jesse	Sounds good! I'm making dinner now so I was actually just about to text you that id be late 
2018-02-19 20:32:18	jesse	Hey Janne, I found a website you've probably already seen, but i'll share it anyway. https://clinicaltrials.gov for the clinical trials.  It wouldn't help with the other information we need though.
2018-02-19 20:32:18		Home - ClinicalTrials.gov 
2018-02-19 22:22:55	jesse	One of my group member completed his role of implementing crazy eight. so happy. pretty sure the solitaire guy hasnt started though. still though. its a nice feeling. Good luck with your group's meeting. 
2018-02-19 22:26:18	jesse	And my part of the project is almost done :slightly_smiling_face: 
2018-02-19 22:36:31	jesse	Oh, and Arun got back to me saying he can run stuff in yurika. I told him to contact you. Id be free to meet up again tomorrow after class or Wednesday night if you think i could be of assistance for anything drug company related... but i felt pretty worthless today haha. 
2018-02-19 22:36:31		If Arun's yurika thing doesn't work out, we should tell Meaghan we are struggling with the drug companies. 
2018-02-21 16:20:46	jesse	let me know if there's anything i can do to help with the pharma stuff. (if you're working on that.). i reached this strange point where all my homework is done and have nothing else to do but drink tea xD

2018-02-22 17:22:17		Derek Banas: Lisp Tutorial 
2018-02-23 07:47:39	jesse	hey Janne, id be free to meet today before 4:30 if ya wanna do raredx stuff.  
2018-02-23 07:56:37	jesse	though that may be difficult if you need to park somewhere 
2018-02-23 13:08:48	Janne	Hey Jesse! I actually can't meet today. I just realized I have a test for my other class that I haven't studied for. That's my main priority today :disappointed: 
2018-02-23 13:22:05	jesse	that's alright. ive been doing other stuff anyway.  btw I'm not sure if i would use that lisp video you sent. The lisp that menzies is having us learn is kinda different than regular lisp. 
2018-02-23 15:22:14	Janne	Awww ohk /: 
2018-02-23 15:22:20	Janne	Yeah I haven't watched that video yet 
2018-02-23 15:22:29	Janne	Guess I need to just read the pdf he has on the site 
2018-02-23 15:41:16	jesse	i watched the first half of the video. it's pretty good and helped me get used to some of the look and feel for lisp as well as a few added functions that are nice to know.
2018-02-23 15:41:16		that pdf is what test questions will come from though... and that syntax is kinda different... some of it isn't even valid lisp such as the "label" function. 
2018-02-28 19:07:57	Janne	Hey there! Would you happen to know where the LISP pdf is? 
2018-02-28 19:25:52	jesse	i think i can find it. 
2018-02-28 19:28:10	jesse	@jesse uploaded a file: https://ncstateuniversityitng.slack.com/files/U8QQFV2GG/F9GGEV0D9/jmc.ps (jmc.ps)

2018-01-23 11:02:12	Janne	Hey jesse! I'm having trouble accessing power6a. I was wondering if I can get your help before consulting Meaghan. 
2018-01-23 11:02:42	jesse	Ahh good. I really dont wanna work on english right now :) 
2018-01-23 11:02:51	jesse	whats up? 
2018-01-23 11:03:33	Janne	I can't ssh into anything lol, I tried the passwords meaghan gave me but I've been denied permission everytime 
2018-01-23 11:04:08	jesse	youre prompted for a password? 
2018-01-23 11:05:06	Janne	Yeah for http://power6a.oscar.ncsu.edu (power6a.oscar.ncsu.edu) I am but for http://proxy.oscar.ncsu.edu (proxy.oscar.ncsu.edu) I am denied permision 
2018-01-23 11:05:12	Janne	Does it just log in for yours? 
2018-01-23 11:07:22	jesse	yep. Since I gave them my ssh key, all I need to do is run ssh oscar or ssh oscardb.... I also configured that command to connect to http://proxy.oscar.ncsu.edu (proxy.oscar.ncsu.edu)  and http://power6a.oscar.ncsu.edu (power6a.oscar.ncsu.edu) automatically 
2018-01-23 11:07:31	jesse	but no password prompt 
2018-01-23 11:07:39	Janne	yeahhhh that's not happening for me 
2018-01-23 11:07:57	jesse	so you can log into proxy but not power? 
2018-01-23 11:08:00	Janne	I gave her my ssh key but I think something is messed up in my set 
2018-01-23 11:08:06	Janne	I can't log into both 
2018-01-23 11:08:25	jesse	...did you give her your public key or private? 
2018-01-23 11:09:18	Janne	public 
2018-01-23 11:10:08	jesse	you should probably talk to meaghan then. 
2018-01-23 11:10:23	Janne	Oh i know what's happening, when I try to ssh my key that was used can't be found 
2018-01-23 11:10:40	jesse	is it not in the .ssh directory? 
2018-01-23 11:10:47	Janne	it is 
2018-01-23 11:11:05	Janne	but it the output logs when I ssh it doesn't know to search that key? 
2018-01-23 11:11:58	Janne	I'm in!!! :smile: 
2018-01-23 11:12:27	jesse	yeayy! 
2018-01-23 11:13:03	Janne	lol I'm sorry I bothered you 
2018-01-23 11:13:27	jesse	youre good. 
2018-01-23 14:32:27	jesse	Hey Janne, what are you currently working on as far as rare diseases? 
2018-01-23 15:01:46	Janne	I've been slacking on the organs but I'll get that done soon. I was also planning on starting to look at some of the websites we have to crawl, but I was hoping we could section out which websites each member was going to crawl before working on it. 
2018-01-23 15:09:30	jesse	I've been slacking  on this since Friday or something.  i was gonna start crawling  some time since yurika seems pretty simple. would you maybe wanna work on this some after plm? 
2018-01-23 15:26:16	Janne	Yeah sure! 
2018-01-23 15:26:39	jesse	cool! 
2018-01-23 17:49:09	jesse	wanna meet at the library? 
2018-01-23 18:06:41	jesse	Just noticed that there are some urls added with Yurika. I'm guessing you did that? I kinda expected that this would be running locally rather than one shared session between us. Since this is the case, do you think that we should run all of the links at once? 
2018-01-23 18:09:11	jesse	I'm also wondering if the output will be downloaded onto our system or if it will be saved onto their server/db. the latter may be problematic 
2018-01-23 18:13:45	Janne	I did not add them lol but I noticed that as well 
2018-01-23 18:13:59	jesse	it may have been me lol 
2018-01-23 18:14:24	Janne	lol how did that happen? were you able to use Yurika already? (outside of the web version) 
2018-01-23 18:14:53	jesse	pretty sure the web version is the only version 
2018-01-23 18:24:00	Janne	oh lol ohk :sweat_smile: 
2018-01-23 18:25:13	jesse	this things weird. 
2018-01-23 18:29:16	jesse	it seems like you have to know exactly what you want before you start scraping... usually, I would think you would want to get everything downloaded first and then start filtering. 
2018-01-23 18:31:08	jesse	ok so I put a blank mindmap and a query for 'pregnancy'. shall I run the thing and see what happens? 
2018-01-23 18:34:46	jesse	ok so nothing happened... not really surprised lol... is there something we could be doing that doesn't involve yurika? I'm thinkin we should just leave this for after thursdays meeting when they are gonna teach us the thing. [:+1::skin-tone-4:1] 
2018-01-23 18:48:27	jesse	should I go and make the databases? or does more stuff need to be done with the CSV's ? 
2018-01-23 21:41:34	Janne	Oh yeah we do have access to the database? 
2018-01-23 21:41:45	Janne	Oh where can we access the db btw? 
2018-01-23 21:42:00	Janne	Ummm idk if we should just yet 
2018-01-23 21:42:25	jesse	which one? 
2018-01-23 21:43:56	jesse	we have to make the databases for the hospitals and specialists. We have access to a few others but they don't have much important information for our part of the project 
2018-01-23 21:44:24	Janne	i guess the ones currently available 
2018-01-23 21:44:57	Janne	i know we do but i'm not sure if we have the schemas for all the tables yet (hospital and or specialists), or do we? 
2018-01-23 21:46:04	jesse	We don't have a set schema, it would just be whatever is on the csv's. 
2018-01-23 21:46:46	Janne	i figured, we haven't cleaned the other medical facilities yet right? 
2018-01-23 21:47:15	jesse	correct. 
2018-01-23 21:48:44	jesse	I didn't have permission to modify the google sheets so I couldn't do that. 
2018-01-23 21:49:56	Janne	oh ohk that's weird, I can try to give you access? 
2018-01-23 21:50:03	Janne	idk why that keeps happening 
2018-01-23 21:51:42	jesse	I'm not sure. I'll see if theres a way to fix it. 
2018-01-23 21:52:18	Janne	oh wait, did you say you're not using your ncsu acct? 
2018-01-23 21:52:33	jesse	i made the folder... that shouldnt matter 
2018-01-23 21:52:49	Janne	oh you right 
2018-01-23 21:53:18	Janne	which ones can't you acces? 
2018-01-23 21:53:21	Janne	access* 
2018-01-23 21:53:41	Janne	@Janne uploaded a file: https://ncstateuniversityitng.slack.com/files/U8QQDGG2C/F8X2Z0TG9/screen_shot_2018-01-23_at_9.53.11_pm.png (Screen Shot 2018-01-23 at 9.53.11 PM.png) 
2018-01-23 21:54:42	jesse	ahh maybe i was signed in as my ncsu account 
2018-01-23 21:54:59	jesse	i can edit now 
2018-01-23 21:55:50	Janne	yayyyy :smile: 
2018-01-23 21:56:23	jesse	so get this... im signed in as jesse.simpson and when I click a link, it says I'm jlsimps4... 
2018-01-23 21:56:29	Janne	can you note down which columns you remove if you remove any? 
2018-01-23 21:56:35	Janne	lol what link? 
2018-01-23 21:56:48	jesse	any spreadsheet... then I have to manually change the accounts 
2018-01-23 21:58:34	jesse	but yeah I can note down the columns I remove. Honestly, I'm thinkin about just modeling them all after the hospital one and making one ginormous table out of it. 
2018-01-23 21:59:02	Janne	That's what I wanted to do to, but there's seriously a lot more columns in some of the other tables 
2018-01-23 21:59:32	jesse	well we can keep them in separate tables then. 
2018-01-23 21:59:53	jesse	we don't even know how these are going to be used anyway :disappointed: 
2018-01-23 22:00:00	Janne	Sorry for reiterating this but I just want to make sure we aren't deleting any possible data that we don't know that meaning to 
2018-01-23 22:00:06	Janne	Exactly 
2018-01-23 22:00:35	Janne	it would be nice to have a better description that just "rare diseases" lol 
2018-01-23 22:00:40	Janne	it would help a lottt 
2018-01-23 22:01:33	jesse	yeah. We may get that after the meeting with the real people. 
2018-01-23 22:01:58	Janne	i can't go to that meeting :tired_face: 
2018-01-23 22:02:03	Janne	I have class during that time 
2018-01-23 22:02:45	jesse	shoot thats during PLM isn't it?! 
2018-01-23 22:03:54	Janne	yeahhh im pretty sure 
2018-01-23 22:04:08	jesse	Dang!! 
2018-01-23 22:04:20	Janne	I wish I could skip that class, but I cant risk it 
2018-01-23 22:05:42	jesse	it doesn't seem like a hard class, but since its team based, I don't wanna mess up my other team members. 
2018-01-23 22:09:41	jesse	ya know we could just keep all the columns as they are and just query for whatever we need. It's a little bit of a waste in memory tho 
2018-01-23 22:10:16	Janne	yeahh that's what we have to think about 
2018-01-23 22:12:19	jesse	If we keep all of the columns that we don't fully understand... then we are only able to remove columns that don't have a purpose (such as a column with the same value for every entry)... and there aren't many of those 
2018-01-23 22:15:07	jesse	website and ownership are both not available for every entry in nursing homes but in a way, it could be useful to know what information we would not be able to extract... but more than likely, its worthless data 
2018-01-23 22:20:17	jesse	As for the things we are unsure about; if we are unsure about what the data is, then I would imagine that kowolenko wouldn't understand either since he isn't a medical professional.. and then we wouldn't be able to use that data anyway. So we could go for the conservative approach or the trim everything approach. I think its best to keep everything until we know how hospitals and specialists will be used in the system. Its possible that most of this data is irrelevant anyway. [:+1::skin-tone-4:1] 
2018-01-23 22:23:50	jesse	Something more concerning is the fact that we don't yet have a way to match each specialist to a particular hospital... I'm looking at the specialist table now and those columns are mostly blank 
2018-01-30 20:07:42	jesse	Hey Janne, I found a table if ya wanted to join. Im on the 3rd floor. as you come up the stairs, just take a u turn on your left. 
2018-02-04 15:19:54	jesse	Hey Janne, do you have an idea of what you're gonna try to get done for raredx stuff this week? 
2018-02-04 15:20:35	Janne	As of right now I'm creating the attributes from tehrare dx companies to filter into yurika and my own crawler 
2018-02-04 15:20:56	Janne	Also that's what I'll mostly be using to create some sort of table of data 
2018-02-04 15:21:16	jesse	by raredx companies do you mean the list of pharmacies and whatever kowolenko sent us? 
2018-02-04 15:25:00	jesse	Also, I was considering asking meaghan if she could handle the AgensGraph/gephi stuff since Sagar won't be available... but I'm not too sure yet since I may have time to figure that out. 
2018-02-04 15:25:29	Janne	Yeah that's what I meant :slightly_smiling_face: 
2018-02-04 15:25:47	Janne	After I creating my basic tables I was also thinking of tackling that stuff 
2018-02-04 15:25:56	Janne	have you made any progress on that? 
2018-02-04 15:27:35	jesse	not really. I just installed the two programs... its a lil screwy cuz you have to uninstall postgresql for it to work... I think I'm going to try to extract the specialists relation to rare diseases from the pubmed website. and maybe i'll come back to that. 
2018-02-04 15:28:07	Janne	What I'm thinking is that we if we can find some way to have the gephi application work on our application we can import the data from our database as GEXF files. https://gephi.org/users/supported-graph-formats/ 
2018-02-04 15:31:10	Janne	Do you know who uploaded the list_of_rare_dx in our RareDiseases folder? 
2018-02-04 15:32:42	jesse	is that the one that starts with acquired hemophilia? 
2018-02-04 15:32:52	Janne	Yuppp 
2018-02-04 15:33:36	jesse	me. I took that from nords website with curl and used grep to filter the nonsense 
2018-02-04 15:43:33	Janne	Oh ohk. Dr. Kowolenko said that he created the rare diseases table using the data from NORD and GARD. 
2018-02-04 15:44:32	Janne	The disease_names_genes table contains around 30,000 specific diseases. If you want a more extensive list :slightly_smiling_face: 
2018-02-04 15:44:52	Janne	I'm thinking of just connecting to it in my python script to read it. 
2018-02-04 15:45:50	Janne	But in my opinion i think the table in the NCBI database is kinda organized funny. We haven't really be briefed about the whole structured so maybe if we had one we'll get a better understanding. 
2018-02-04 15:46:05	Janne	Thanks for uploading that list! 
2018-02-04 15:49:03	jesse	is that table what dr. kowolenko meant when he mentioned he made a list of the diseases? 
2018-02-04 15:50:06	Janne	There are several "disease" tables in the ncbi database but that one (disease_names...) is the only one I found where the "disease" column has actual disease values. 
2018-02-04 15:50:19	Janne	Other tabled like the pubmed db has a giant description of the database 
2018-02-04 15:51:05	jesse	qjk 
2018-02-04 15:51:13	jesse	didn't mean to send that lol 
2018-02-04 15:51:18	Janne	lololol 
2018-02-04 15:51:30	jesse	trying to do psql stuff in the terminal haha 
2018-02-04 16:13:57	jesse	the issue with the bigger lists of rare diseases is that I cant make yurika crawl 30,000 websites and the websites those queries link to... 
2018-02-04 16:14:46	Janne	true, but another argument is that you might miss some rare diseases 
2018-02-04 16:15:05	Janne	We can always section up the data we use in the crawler 
2018-02-04 16:15:16	Janne	Are you thinking of using your own crawler as well? 
2018-02-04 16:18:36	jesse	I'm using my instance of yurika right now. I might make my own script to specifically search for the authors of each article on pubmed. 
2018-02-04 16:20:45	jesse	its kinda complicated, trying to match up the rare disease to the specialist... and even when I get the information, I'll have no idea if that info is reliable since there are many people with the same name in the US. 
2018-02-04 16:22:51	jesse	maybe I can make a dictionary of the specialists and search on that dictionary with the queries of rare-dx's .... but that would be over 30,000 names 
2018-02-04 16:25:04	jesse	I feel really incompetent when it comes to this project  (-_-) 
2018-02-04 18:32:02	Janne	Me too :tired_face: 
2018-02-04 18:32:09	Janne	Are you running Yurika rn? 
2018-02-04 18:32:29	jesse	no 
2018-02-05 09:33:26	jesse	Let me know if you get around to trying to do the gephi/agensgraph stuff... i had a few dependency issues when I was trying to install and run it 
2018-02-05 12:23:25	Janne	Ohk :slightly_smiling_face: I probably wont be working on it until tomorrow. 
2018-02-05 12:23:33	Janne	Mainly working on Senior Design today 
2018-02-05 12:24:28	jesse	I gotcha. I probably won't do much of this today either. I'm getting kinda tired lol 
2018-02-05 15:10:39	Janne	Me too :disappointed: 
2018-02-05 15:10:47	Janne	But we can totally do this!! 
2018-02-05 21:19:49	jesse	@jesse uploaded a file: https://ncstateuniversityitng.slack.com/files/U8QQFV2GG/F94B5D9EE/sample_data_to_convert_to_csv.js (sample data to convert to csv) and commented: Hey Janne... I've got this big text file filled with rare disease info, and specialist name, but I'm kinda blanking on what the best way to process it. Could you take a look? each entry in the txt file looks like this... 
2018-02-05 21:23:50	jesse	I'd like to make a dataframe out of it all but theres multiple authors and multiple author locations which makes it confusing. 
2018-02-05 21:30:40	jesse	I think I got it. im just bein dumb. 
2018-02-06 08:18:41	Janne	I thought I ad sent this yesterday: "Yeah sure! I won't be working on this until tomorrow though :disappointed: I have a senior design tonight" 
2018-02-06 09:43:40	jesse	thats ok. i made a csv out of it. its ugly tho 
2018-02-07 19:25:40	Janne	Ohk I'm getting really frustrated at Sagar rn lol 
2018-02-07 19:31:56	jesse	whys that? im not lookin at the messages rn, im doin laundry 
2018-02-07 19:34:00	Janne	Lol it's all good. He's helping now but literally I was asking him for an example of one line of code and he gave me references to things I had that didn't have. But it's all good now lol I was getting frustrated for a little bit 
2018-02-07 19:36:29	jesse	gotcha. i tried understanding the question but I don't really understand the context. Glad it worked out. 
2018-02-11 09:13:30	jesse	Hey Janne, do you understand the PLM homework? 
2018-02-12 10:06:57	Janne	Hey! Sorry for the late response. No i dont really understand what's going on. 
2018-02-12 10:07:17	Janne	But i saw Alex Phelp's post 
2018-02-12 10:07:28	Janne	I think that'll help but I haven't read it yet 
2018-02-12 10:08:21	jesse	oh thats ok. i saw that too. i ended up just doing something that looks like it could be right and submitting it... i spent too much time trying to interpret it. 
2018-02-13 10:08:12	Janne	Rightt I'm on that problem now. 
2018-02-13 10:08:26	Janne	Do you think you have any time to meet before class starts? 
2018-02-13 10:09:10	jesse	about raredx stuff or the plm homework? 
2018-02-13 10:33:26	jesse	not that it changes my answer. I can meet up, but I wont be much use to you for the plm assignment 
2018-02-13 10:45:44	jesse	Just let me know if ya want to meet. I'm available all day except for plm class time. [:+1::skin-tone-4:1] 
2018-02-13 13:17:18	jesse	Hey Janne, how is crawling the drug companies going? and how is linking specialists with raredx from pubmed? 
2018-02-13 13:21:37	Janne	Can we meet after my senior design class? We get out around 2:40PM 
2018-02-13 13:21:44	jesse	Sure thing 
2018-02-13 14:44:34	jesse	I have a table on the 3rd floor behind the printers 
2018-02-15 13:10:10	jesse	Did you retain a lot of the last PLM lecture? All that stuff went completely over my head lol. 
2018-02-15 13:10:49	jesse	I'm looking over Menzies notes now 
2018-02-18 16:05:11	jesse	Hey Janne, I got to a point with the pubmed data where I gave the rest of the work to Arun and I'm free to do other things. How is the drug company stuff going? 
2018-02-18 17:14:30	jesse	Let me know if you want me to help. As for the pubmed data, I got the script to make a CSV. its about a gigabyte big and is mildly buggy so I let Arun handle it since there isn't a whole lot of work to do now that the CSV is populating. 
2018-02-19 08:32:00	Janne	Hey there! Would you be down to work on DrugCo later today? 
2018-02-19 09:23:08	jesse	I'll be free after 5pm. I've got some classes on main on Monday/Wednesday. 
2018-02-19 10:47:26	Janne	I can do after 5 on main :slightly_smiling_face: 
2018-02-19 10:48:36	jesse	ok. If it's on main, I'll be available as soon as 4:15 and will also be available 1 - 3 (but i usually use that time for homework.) 
2018-02-19 15:01:09	Janne	Would you want to work on Main or Hunt? 
2018-02-19 15:01:21	Janne	I can be there after 5. Better parking for both options :slightly_smiling_face: 
2018-02-19 15:42:20	jesse	I can be at either places. My preference would probably be hunt though 
2018-02-19 16:22:57	Janne	That's fine with me too! So I'm in durham and its about rush hour :expressionless: would it be cool if we meet closer to 6:-6:30 when the traffic has died. 
2018-02-19 16:35:52	jesse	Sounds good! I'm making dinner now so I was actually just about to text you that id be late 
2018-02-19 20:32:18	jesse	Hey Janne, I found a website you've probably already seen, but i'll share it anyway. https://clinicaltrials.gov for the clinical trials.  It wouldn't help with the other information we need though.
2018-02-19 20:32:18		Home - ClinicalTrials.gov 
2018-02-19 22:22:55	jesse	One of my group member completed his role of implementing crazy eight. so happy. pretty sure the solitaire guy hasnt started though. still though. its a nice feeling. Good luck with your group's meeting. 
2018-02-19 22:26:18	jesse	And my part of the project is almost done :slightly_smiling_face: 
2018-02-19 22:36:31	jesse	Oh, and Arun got back to me saying he can run stuff in yurika. I told him to contact you. Id be free to meet up again tomorrow after class or Wednesday night if you think i could be of assistance for anything drug company related... but i felt pretty worthless today haha. 
2018-02-19 22:36:31		If Arun's yurika thing doesn't work out, we should tell Meaghan we are struggling with the drug companies. 
2018-02-21 16:20:46	jesse	let me know if there's anything i can do to help with the pharma stuff. (if you're working on that.). i reached this strange point where all my homework is done and have nothing else to do but drink tea xD

2018-02-22 17:22:17		Derek Banas: Lisp Tutorial 
2018-02-23 07:47:39	jesse	hey Janne, id be free to meet today before 4:30 if ya wanna do raredx stuff.  
2018-02-23 07:56:37	jesse	though that may be difficult if you need to park somewhere 
2018-02-23 13:08:48	Janne	Hey Jesse! I actually can't meet today. I just realized I have a test for my other class that I haven't studied for. That's my main priority today :disappointed: 
2018-02-23 13:22:05	jesse	that's alright. ive been doing other stuff anyway.  btw I'm not sure if i would use that lisp video you sent. The lisp that menzies is having us learn is kinda different than regular lisp. 
2018-02-23 15:22:14	Janne	Awww ohk /: 
2018-02-23 15:22:20	Janne	Yeah I haven't watched that video yet 
2018-02-23 15:22:29	Janne	Guess I need to just read the pdf he has on the site 
2018-02-23 15:41:16	jesse	i watched the first half of the video. it's pretty good and helped me get used to some of the look and feel for lisp as well as a few added functions that are nice to know.
2018-02-23 15:41:16		that pdf is what test questions will come from though... and that syntax is kinda different... some of it isn't even valid lisp such as the "label" function. 
2018-02-28 19:07:57	Janne	Hey there! Would you happen to know where the LISP pdf is? 
2018-02-28 19:25:52	jesse	i think i can find it. 
2018-02-28 19:28:10	jesse	@jesse uploaded a file: https://ncstateuniversityitng.slack.com/files/U8QQFV2GG/F9GGEV0D9/jmc.ps (jmc.ps)

2018-03-19 22:26:30	jesse	I'm not sure my task for the week is gonna be very fruitful.. so if ya need help with anything regarding the drug company data, just let me know. 
2018-04-01 10:53:10	jesse	Hey Janne, does any of the information you're gathering relate to the social groups for each raredx? And would I find that info on some of the websites you are searching through? 
2018-04-02 16:56:31		getting channel history...
2018-01-23 11:02:12	Janne	Hey jesse! I'm having trouble accessing power6a. I was wondering if I can get your help before consulting Meaghan. 
2018-01-23 11:02:42	jesse	Ahh good. I really dont wanna work on english right now :) 
2018-01-23 11:02:51	jesse	whats up? 
2018-01-23 11:03:33	Janne	I can't ssh into anything lol, I tried the passwords meaghan gave me but I've been denied permission everytime 
2018-01-23 11:04:08	jesse	youre prompted for a password? 
2018-01-23 11:05:06	Janne	Yeah for http://power6a.oscar.ncsu.edu (power6a.oscar.ncsu.edu) I am but for http://proxy.oscar.ncsu.edu (proxy.oscar.ncsu.edu) I am denied permision 
2018-01-23 11:05:12	Janne	Does it just log in for yours? 
2018-01-23 11:07:22	jesse	yep. Since I gave them my ssh key, all I need to do is run ssh oscar or ssh oscardb.... I also configured that command to connect to http://proxy.oscar.ncsu.edu (proxy.oscar.ncsu.edu)  and http://power6a.oscar.ncsu.edu (power6a.oscar.ncsu.edu) automatically 
2018-01-23 11:07:31	jesse	but no password prompt 
2018-01-23 11:07:39	Janne	yeahhhh that's not happening for me 
2018-01-23 11:07:57	jesse	so you can log into proxy but not power? 
2018-01-23 11:08:00	Janne	I gave her my ssh key but I think something is messed up in my set 
2018-01-23 11:08:06	Janne	I can't log into both 
2018-01-23 11:08:25	jesse	...did you give her your public key or private? 
2018-01-23 11:09:18	Janne	public 
2018-01-23 11:10:08	jesse	you should probably talk to meaghan then. 
2018-01-23 11:10:23	Janne	Oh i know what's happening, when I try to ssh my key that was used can't be found 
2018-01-23 11:10:40	jesse	is it not in the .ssh directory? 
2018-01-23 11:10:47	Janne	it is 
2018-01-23 11:11:05	Janne	but it the output logs when I ssh it doesn't know to search that key? 
2018-01-23 11:11:58	Janne	I'm in!!! :smile: 
2018-01-23 11:12:27	jesse	yeayy! 
2018-01-23 11:13:03	Janne	lol I'm sorry I bothered you 
2018-01-23 11:13:27	jesse	youre good. 
2018-01-23 14:32:27	jesse	Hey Janne, what are you currently working on as far as rare diseases? 
2018-01-23 15:01:46	Janne	I've been slacking on the organs but I'll get that done soon. I was also planning on starting to look at some of the websites we have to crawl, but I was hoping we could section out which websites each member was going to crawl before working on it. 
2018-01-23 15:09:30	jesse	I've been slacking  on this since Friday or something.  i was gonna start crawling  some time since yurika seems pretty simple. would you maybe wanna work on this some after plm? 
2018-01-23 15:26:16	Janne	Yeah sure! 
2018-01-23 15:26:39	jesse	cool! 
2018-01-23 17:49:09	jesse	wanna meet at the library? 
2018-01-23 18:06:41	jesse	Just noticed that there are some urls added with Yurika. I'm guessing you did that? I kinda expected that this would be running locally rather than one shared session between us. Since this is the case, do you think that we should run all of the links at once? 
2018-01-23 18:09:11	jesse	I'm also wondering if the output will be downloaded onto our system or if it will be saved onto their server/db. the latter may be problematic 
2018-01-23 18:13:45	Janne	I did not add them lol but I noticed that as well 
2018-01-23 18:13:59	jesse	it may have been me lol 
2018-01-23 18:14:24	Janne	lol how did that happen? were you able to use Yurika already? (outside of the web version) 
2018-01-23 18:14:53	jesse	pretty sure the web version is the only version 
2018-01-23 18:24:00	Janne	oh lol ohk :sweat_smile: 
2018-01-23 18:25:13	jesse	this things weird. 
2018-01-23 18:29:16	jesse	it seems like you have to know exactly what you want before you start scraping... usually, I would think you would want to get everything downloaded first and then start filtering. 
2018-01-23 18:31:08	jesse	ok so I put a blank mindmap and a query for 'pregnancy'. shall I run the thing and see what happens? 
2018-01-23 18:34:46	jesse	ok so nothing happened... not really surprised lol... is there something we could be doing that doesn't involve yurika? I'm thinkin we should just leave this for after thursdays meeting when they are gonna teach us the thing. [:+1::skin-tone-4:1] 
2018-01-23 18:48:27	jesse	should I go and make the databases? or does more stuff need to be done with the CSV's ? 
2018-01-23 21:41:34	Janne	Oh yeah we do have access to the database? 
2018-01-23 21:41:45	Janne	Oh where can we access the db btw? 
2018-01-23 21:42:00	Janne	Ummm idk if we should just yet 
2018-01-23 21:42:25	jesse	which one? 
2018-01-23 21:43:56	jesse	we have to make the databases for the hospitals and specialists. We have access to a few others but they don't have much important information for our part of the project 
2018-01-23 21:44:24	Janne	i guess the ones currently available 
2018-01-23 21:44:57	Janne	i know we do but i'm not sure if we have the schemas for all the tables yet (hospital and or specialists), or do we? 
2018-01-23 21:46:04	jesse	We don't have a set schema, it would just be whatever is on the csv's. 
2018-01-23 21:46:46	Janne	i figured, we haven't cleaned the other medical facilities yet right? 
2018-01-23 21:47:15	jesse	correct. 
2018-01-23 21:48:44	jesse	I didn't have permission to modify the google sheets so I couldn't do that. 
2018-01-23 21:49:56	Janne	oh ohk that's weird, I can try to give you access? 
2018-01-23 21:50:03	Janne	idk why that keeps happening 
2018-01-23 21:51:42	jesse	I'm not sure. I'll see if theres a way to fix it. 
2018-01-23 21:52:18	Janne	oh wait, did you say you're not using your ncsu acct? 
2018-01-23 21:52:33	jesse	i made the folder... that shouldnt matter 
2018-01-23 21:52:49	Janne	oh you right 
2018-01-23 21:53:18	Janne	which ones can't you acces? 
2018-01-23 21:53:21	Janne	access*

2018-01-23 21:54:42	jesse	ahh maybe i was signed in as my ncsu account 
2018-01-23 21:54:59	jesse	i can edit now 
2018-01-23 21:55:50	Janne	yayyyy :smile: 
2018-01-23 21:56:23	jesse	so get this... im signed in as jesse.simpson and when I click a link, it says I'm jlsimps4... 
2018-01-23 21:56:29	Janne	can you note down which columns you remove if you remove any? 
2018-01-23 21:56:35	Janne	lol what link? 
2018-01-23 21:56:48	jesse	any spreadsheet... then I have to manually change the accounts 
2018-01-23 21:58:34	jesse	but yeah I can note down the columns I remove. Honestly, I'm thinkin about just modeling them all after the hospital one and making one ginormous table out of it. 
2018-01-23 21:59:02	Janne	That's what I wanted to do to, but there's seriously a lot more columns in some of the other tables 
2018-01-23 21:59:32	jesse	well we can keep them in separate tables then. 
2018-01-23 21:59:53	jesse	we don't even know how these are going to be used anyway :disappointed: 
2018-01-23 22:00:00	Janne	Sorry for reiterating this but I just want to make sure we aren't deleting any possible data that we don't know that meaning to 
2018-01-23 22:00:06	Janne	Exactly 
2018-01-23 22:00:35	Janne	it would be nice to have a better description that just "rare diseases" lol 
2018-01-23 22:00:40	Janne	it would help a lottt 
2018-01-23 22:01:33	jesse	yeah. We may get that after the meeting with the real people. 
2018-01-23 22:01:58	Janne	i can't go to that meeting :tired_face: 
2018-01-23 22:02:03	Janne	I have class during that time 
2018-01-23 22:02:45	jesse	shoot thats during PLM isn't it?! 
2018-01-23 22:03:54	Janne	yeahhh im pretty sure 
2018-01-23 22:04:08	jesse	Dang!! 
2018-01-23 22:04:20	Janne	I wish I could skip that class, but I cant risk it 
2018-01-23 22:05:42	jesse	it doesn't seem like a hard class, but since its team based, I don't wanna mess up my other team members. 
2018-01-23 22:09:41	jesse	ya know we could just keep all the columns as they are and just query for whatever we need. It's a little bit of a waste in memory tho 
2018-01-23 22:10:16	Janne	yeahh that's what we have to think about 
2018-01-23 22:12:19	jesse	If we keep all of the columns that we don't fully understand... then we are only able to remove columns that don't have a purpose (such as a column with the same value for every entry)... and there aren't many of those 
2018-01-23 22:15:07	jesse	website and ownership are both not available for every entry in nursing homes but in a way, it could be useful to know what information we would not be able to extract... but more than likely, its worthless data 
2018-01-23 22:20:17	jesse	As for the things we are unsure about; if we are unsure about what the data is, then I would imagine that kowolenko wouldn't understand either since he isn't a medical professional.. and then we wouldn't be able to use that data anyway. So we could go for the conservative approach or the trim everything approach. I think its best to keep everything until we know how hospitals and specialists will be used in the system. Its possible that most of this data is irrelevant anyway. [:+1::skin-tone-4:1] 
2018-01-23 22:23:50	jesse	Something more concerning is the fact that we don't yet have a way to match each specialist to a particular hospital... I'm looking at the specialist table now and those columns are mostly blank 
2018-01-30 20:07:42	jesse	Hey Janne, I found a table if ya wanted to join. Im on the 3rd floor. as you come up the stairs, just take a u turn on your left. 
2018-02-04 15:19:54	jesse	Hey Janne, do you have an idea of what you're gonna try to get done for raredx stuff this week? 
2018-02-04 15:20:35	Janne	As of right now I'm creating the attributes from tehrare dx companies to filter into yurika and my own crawler 
2018-02-04 15:20:56	Janne	Also that's what I'll mostly be using to create some sort of table of data 
2018-02-04 15:21:16	jesse	by raredx companies do you mean the list of pharmacies and whatever kowolenko sent us? 
2018-02-04 15:25:00	jesse	Also, I was considering asking meaghan if she could handle the AgensGraph/gephi stuff since Sagar won't be available... but I'm not too sure yet since I may have time to figure that out. 
2018-02-04 15:25:29	Janne	Yeah that's what I meant :slightly_smiling_face: 
2018-02-04 15:25:47	Janne	After I creating my basic tables I was also thinking of tackling that stuff 
2018-02-04 15:25:56	Janne	have you made any progress on that? 
2018-02-04 15:27:35	jesse	not really. I just installed the two programs... its a lil screwy cuz you have to uninstall postgresql for it to work... I think I'm going to try to extract the specialists relation to rare diseases from the pubmed website. and maybe i'll come back to that. 
2018-02-04 15:28:07	Janne	What I'm thinking is that we if we can find some way to have the gephi application work on our application we can import the data from our database as GEXF files. https://gephi.org/users/supported-graph-formats/ 
2018-02-04 15:31:10	Janne	Do you know who uploaded the list_of_rare_dx in our RareDiseases folder? 
2018-02-04 15:32:42	jesse	is that the one that starts with acquired hemophilia? 
2018-02-04 15:32:52	Janne	Yuppp 
2018-02-04 15:33:36	jesse	me. I took that from nords website with curl and used grep to filter the nonsense 
2018-02-04 15:43:33	Janne	Oh ohk. Dr. Kowolenko said that he created the rare diseases table using the data from NORD and GARD. 
2018-02-04 15:44:32	Janne	The disease_names_genes table contains around 30,000 specific diseases. If you want a more extensive list :slightly_smiling_face: 
2018-02-04 15:44:52	Janne	I'm thinking of just connecting to it in my python script to read it. 
2018-02-04 15:45:50	Janne	But in my opinion i think the table in the NCBI database is kinda organized funny. We haven't really be briefed about the whole structured so maybe if we had one we'll get a better understanding. 
2018-02-04 15:46:05	Janne	Thanks for uploading that list! 
2018-02-04 15:49:03	jesse	is that table what dr. kowolenko meant when he mentioned he made a list of the diseases? 
2018-02-04 15:50:06	Janne	There are several "disease" tables in the ncbi database but that one (disease_names...) is the only one I found where the "disease" column has actual disease values. 
2018-02-04 15:50:19	Janne	Other tabled like the pubmed db has a giant description of the database 
2018-02-04 15:51:05	jesse	qjk 
2018-02-04 15:51:13	jesse	didn't mean to send that lol 
2018-02-04 15:51:18	Janne	lololol 
2018-02-04 15:51:30	jesse	trying to do psql stuff in the terminal haha 
2018-02-04 16:13:57	jesse	the issue with the bigger lists of rare diseases is that I cant make yurika crawl 30,000 websites and the websites those queries link to... 
2018-02-04 16:14:46	Janne	true, but another argument is that you might miss some rare diseases 
2018-02-04 16:15:05	Janne	We can always section up the data we use in the crawler 
2018-02-04 16:15:16	Janne	Are you thinking of using your own crawler as well? 
2018-02-04 16:18:36	jesse	I'm using my instance of yurika right now. I might make my own script to specifically search for the authors of each article on pubmed. 
2018-02-04 16:20:45	jesse	its kinda complicated, trying to match up the rare disease to the specialist... and even when I get the information, I'll have no idea if that info is reliable since there are many people with the same name in the US. 
2018-02-04 16:22:51	jesse	maybe I can make a dictionary of the specialists and search on that dictionary with the queries of rare-dx's .... but that would be over 30,000 names 
2018-02-04 16:25:04	jesse	I feel really incompetent when it comes to this project  (-_-) 
2018-02-04 18:32:02	Janne	Me too :tired_face: 
2018-02-04 18:32:09	Janne	Are you running Yurika rn? 
2018-02-04 18:32:29	jesse	no 
2018-02-05 09:33:26	jesse	Let me know if you get around to trying to do the gephi/agensgraph stuff... i had a few dependency issues when I was trying to install and run it 
2018-02-05 12:23:25	Janne	Ohk :slightly_smiling_face: I probably wont be working on it until tomorrow. 
2018-02-05 12:23:33	Janne	Mainly working on Senior Design today 
2018-02-05 12:24:28	jesse	I gotcha. I probably won't do much of this today either. I'm getting kinda tired lol 
2018-02-05 15:10:39	Janne	Me too :disappointed: 
2018-02-05 15:10:47	Janne	But we can totally do this!! 
2018-02-05 21:19:49	jesse	@jesse uploaded a file: https://ncstateuniversityitng.slack.com/files/U8QQFV2GG/F94B5D9EE/sample_data_to_convert_to_csv.js (sample data to convert to csv) and commented: Hey Janne... I've got this big text file filled with rare disease info, and specialist name, but I'm kinda blanking on what the best way to process it. Could you take a look? each entry in the txt file looks like this... 
2018-02-05 21:23:50	jesse	I'd like to make a dataframe out of it all but theres multiple authors and multiple author locations which makes it confusing. 
2018-02-05 21:30:40	jesse	I think I got it. im just bein dumb. 
2018-02-06 08:18:41	Janne	I thought I ad sent this yesterday: "Yeah sure! I won't be working on this until tomorrow though :disappointed: I have a senior design tonight" 
2018-02-06 09:43:40	jesse	thats ok. i made a csv out of it. its ugly tho 
2018-02-07 19:25:40	Janne	Ohk I'm getting really frustrated at Sagar rn lol 
2018-02-07 19:31:56	jesse	whys that? im not lookin at the messages rn, im doin laundry 
2018-02-07 19:34:00	Janne	Lol it's all good. He's helping now but literally I was asking him for an example of one line of code and he gave me references to things I had that didn't have. But it's all good now lol I was getting frustrated for a little bit 
2018-02-07 19:36:29	jesse	gotcha. i tried understanding the question but I don't really understand the context. Glad it worked out. 
2018-02-11 09:13:30	jesse	Hey Janne, do you understand the PLM homework? 
2018-02-12 10:06:57	Janne	Hey! Sorry for the late response. No i dont really understand what's going on. 
2018-02-12 10:07:17	Janne	But i saw Alex Phelp's post 
2018-02-12 10:07:28	Janne	I think that'll help but I haven't read it yet 
2018-02-12 10:08:21	jesse	oh thats ok. i saw that too. i ended up just doing something that looks like it could be right and submitting it... i spent too much time trying to interpret it. 
2018-02-13 10:08:12	Janne	Rightt I'm on that problem now. 
2018-02-13 10:08:26	Janne	Do you think you have any time to meet before class starts? 
2018-02-13 10:09:10	jesse	about raredx stuff or the plm homework? 
2018-02-13 10:33:26	jesse	not that it changes my answer. I can meet up, but I wont be much use to you for the plm assignment 
2018-02-13 10:45:44	jesse	Just let me know if ya want to meet. I'm available all day except for plm class time. [:+1::skin-tone-4:1] 
2018-02-13 13:17:18	jesse	Hey Janne, how is crawling the drug companies going? and how is linking specialists with raredx from pubmed? 
2018-02-13 13:21:37	Janne	Can we meet after my senior design class? We get out around 2:40PM 
2018-02-13 13:21:44	jesse	Sure thing 
2018-02-13 14:44:34	jesse	I have a table on the 3rd floor behind the printers 
2018-02-15 13:10:10	jesse	Did you retain a lot of the last PLM lecture? All that stuff went completely over my head lol. 
2018-02-15 13:10:49	jesse	I'm looking over Menzies notes now 
2018-02-18 16:05:11	jesse	Hey Janne, I got to a point with the pubmed data where I gave the rest of the work to Arun and I'm free to do other things. How is the drug company stuff going? 
2018-02-18 17:14:30	jesse	Let me know if you want me to help. As for the pubmed data, I got the script to make a CSV. its about a gigabyte big and is mildly buggy so I let Arun handle it since there isn't a whole lot of work to do now that the CSV is populating. 
2018-02-19 08:32:00	Janne	Hey there! Would you be down to work on DrugCo later today? 
2018-02-19 09:23:08	jesse	I'll be free after 5pm. I've got some classes on main on Monday/Wednesday. 
2018-02-19 10:47:26	Janne	I can do after 5 on main :slightly_smiling_face: 
2018-02-19 10:48:36	jesse	ok. If it's on main, I'll be available as soon as 4:15 and will also be available 1 - 3 (but i usually use that time for homework.) 
2018-02-19 15:01:09	Janne	Would you want to work on Main or Hunt? 
2018-02-19 15:01:21	Janne	I can be there after 5. Better parking for both options :slightly_smiling_face: 
2018-02-19 15:42:20	jesse	I can be at either places. My preference would probably be hunt though 
2018-02-19 16:22:57	Janne	That's fine with me too! So I'm in durham and its about rush hour :expressionless: would it be cool if we meet closer to 6:-6:30 when the traffic has died. 
2018-02-19 16:35:52	jesse	Sounds good! I'm making dinner now so I was actually just about to text you that id be late 
2018-02-19 20:32:18	jesse	Hey Janne, I found a website you've probably already seen, but i'll share it anyway. https://clinicaltrials.gov for the clinical trials.  It wouldn't help with the other information we need though.
2018-02-19 20:32:18		Home - ClinicalTrials.gov 
2018-02-19 22:22:55	jesse	One of my group member completed his role of implementing crazy eight. so happy. pretty sure the solitaire guy hasnt started though. still though. its a nice feeling. Good luck with your group's meeting. 
2018-02-19 22:26:18	jesse	And my part of the project is almost done :slightly_smiling_face: 
2018-02-19 22:36:31	jesse	Oh, and Arun got back to me saying he can run stuff in yurika. I told him to contact you. Id be free to meet up again tomorrow after class or Wednesday night if you think i could be of assistance for anything drug company related... but i felt pretty worthless today haha. 
2018-02-19 22:36:31		If Arun's yurika thing doesn't work out, we should tell Meaghan we are struggling with the drug companies. 
2018-02-21 16:20:46	jesse	let me know if there's anything i can do to help with the pharma stuff. (if you're working on that.). i reached this strange point where all my homework is done and have nothing else to do but drink tea xD

2018-02-22 17:22:17		Derek Banas: Lisp Tutorial 
2018-02-23 07:47:39	jesse	hey Janne, id be free to meet today before 4:30 if ya wanna do raredx stuff.  
2018-02-23 07:56:37	jesse	though that may be difficult if you need to park somewhere 
2018-02-23 13:08:48	Janne	Hey Jesse! I actually can't meet today. I just realized I have a test for my other class that I haven't studied for. That's my main priority today :disappointed: 
2018-02-23 13:22:05	jesse	that's alright. ive been doing other stuff anyway.  btw I'm not sure if i would use that lisp video you sent. The lisp that menzies is having us learn is kinda different than regular lisp. 
2018-02-23 15:22:14	Janne	Awww ohk /: 
2018-02-23 15:22:20	Janne	Yeah I haven't watched that video yet 
2018-02-23 15:22:29	Janne	Guess I need to just read the pdf he has on the site 
2018-02-23 15:41:16	jesse	i watched the first half of the video. it's pretty good and helped me get used to some of the look and feel for lisp as well as a few added functions that are nice to know.
2018-02-23 15:41:16		that pdf is what test questions will come from though... and that syntax is kinda different... some of it isn't even valid lisp such as the "label" function. 
2018-02-28 19:07:57	Janne	Hey there! Would you happen to know where the LISP pdf is? 
2018-02-28 19:25:52	jesse	i think i can find it. 
2018-02-28 19:28:10	jesse	@jesse uploaded a file: https://ncstateuniversityitng.slack.com/files/U8QQFV2GG/F9GGEV0D9/jmc.ps (jmc.ps)

2018-03-19 22:26:30	jesse	I'm not sure my task for the week is gonna be very fruitful.. so if ya need help with anything regarding the drug company data, just let me know. 
2018-04-01 10:53:10	jesse	Hey Janne, does any of the information you're gathering relate to the social groups for each raredx? And would I find that info on some of the websites you are searching through? 
2018-04-02 15:08:46	Janne	I have seen that some companies do have social groups 
2018-04-02 15:09:05	Janne	http://www.abbviepaf.org/ 
2018-04-02 15:09:23	Janne	I'm not able to get that information from the 10K file though 
2018-04-02 17:10:02	jesse	Thanks for letting me know 
2018-04-08 11:06:52		getting channel history...
2018-01-23 11:02:12	Janne	Hey jesse! I'm having trouble accessing power6a. I was wondering if I can get your help before consulting Meaghan. 
2018-01-23 11:02:42	jesse	Ahh good. I really dont wanna work on english right now :) 
2018-01-23 11:02:51	jesse	whats up? 
2018-01-23 11:03:33	Janne	I can't ssh into anything lol, I tried the passwords meaghan gave me but I've been denied permission everytime 
2018-01-23 11:04:08	jesse	youre prompted for a password? 
2018-01-23 11:05:06	Janne	Yeah for http://power6a.oscar.ncsu.edu (power6a.oscar.ncsu.edu) I am but for http://proxy.oscar.ncsu.edu (proxy.oscar.ncsu.edu) I am denied permision 
2018-01-23 11:05:12	Janne	Does it just log in for yours? 
2018-01-23 11:07:22	jesse	yep. Since I gave them my ssh key, all I need to do is run ssh oscar or ssh oscardb.... I also configured that command to connect to http://proxy.oscar.ncsu.edu (proxy.oscar.ncsu.edu)  and http://power6a.oscar.ncsu.edu (power6a.oscar.ncsu.edu) automatically 
2018-01-23 11:07:31	jesse	but no password prompt 
2018-01-23 11:07:39	Janne	yeahhhh that's not happening for me 
2018-01-23 11:07:57	jesse	so you can log into proxy but not power? 
2018-01-23 11:08:00	Janne	I gave her my ssh key but I think something is messed up in my set 
2018-01-23 11:08:06	Janne	I can't log into both 
2018-01-23 11:08:25	jesse	...did you give her your public key or private? 
2018-01-23 11:09:18	Janne	public 
2018-01-23 11:10:08	jesse	you should probably talk to meaghan then. 
2018-01-23 11:10:23	Janne	Oh i know what's happening, when I try to ssh my key that was used can't be found 
2018-01-23 11:10:40	jesse	is it not in the .ssh directory? 
2018-01-23 11:10:47	Janne	it is 
2018-01-23 11:11:05	Janne	but it the output logs when I ssh it doesn't know to search that key? 
2018-01-23 11:11:58	Janne	I'm in!!! :smile: 
2018-01-23 11:12:27	jesse	yeayy! 
2018-01-23 11:13:03	Janne	lol I'm sorry I bothered you 
2018-01-23 11:13:27	jesse	youre good. 
2018-01-23 14:32:27	jesse	Hey Janne, what are you currently working on as far as rare diseases? 
2018-01-23 15:01:46	Janne	I've been slacking on the organs but I'll get that done soon. I was also planning on starting to look at some of the websites we have to crawl, but I was hoping we could section out which websites each member was going to crawl before working on it. 
2018-01-23 15:09:30	jesse	I've been slacking  on this since Friday or something.  i was gonna start crawling  some time since yurika seems pretty simple. would you maybe wanna work on this some after plm? 
2018-01-23 15:26:16	Janne	Yeah sure! 
2018-01-23 15:26:39	jesse	cool! 
2018-01-23 17:49:09	jesse	wanna meet at the library? 
2018-01-23 18:06:41	jesse	Just noticed that there are some urls added with Yurika. I'm guessing you did that? I kinda expected that this would be running locally rather than one shared session between us. Since this is the case, do you think that we should run all of the links at once? 
2018-01-23 18:09:11	jesse	I'm also wondering if the output will be downloaded onto our system or if it will be saved onto their server/db. the latter may be problematic 
2018-01-23 18:13:45	Janne	I did not add them lol but I noticed that as well 
2018-01-23 18:13:59	jesse	it may have been me lol 
2018-01-23 18:14:24	Janne	lol how did that happen? were you able to use Yurika already? (outside of the web version) 
2018-01-23 18:14:53	jesse	pretty sure the web version is the only version 
2018-01-23 18:24:00	Janne	oh lol ohk :sweat_smile: 
2018-01-23 18:25:13	jesse	this things weird. 
2018-01-23 18:29:16	jesse	it seems like you have to know exactly what you want before you start scraping... usually, I would think you would want to get everything downloaded first and then start filtering. 
2018-01-23 18:31:08	jesse	ok so I put a blank mindmap and a query for 'pregnancy'. shall I run the thing and see what happens? 
2018-01-23 18:34:46	jesse	ok so nothing happened... not really surprised lol... is there something we could be doing that doesn't involve yurika? I'm thinkin we should just leave this for after thursdays meeting when they are gonna teach us the thing. [:+1::skin-tone-4:1] 
2018-01-23 18:48:27	jesse	should I go and make the databases? or does more stuff need to be done with the CSV's ? 
2018-01-23 21:41:34	Janne	Oh yeah we do have access to the database? 
2018-01-23 21:41:45	Janne	Oh where can we access the db btw? 
2018-01-23 21:42:00	Janne	Ummm idk if we should just yet 
2018-01-23 21:42:25	jesse	which one? 
2018-01-23 21:43:56	jesse	we have to make the databases for the hospitals and specialists. We have access to a few others but they don't have much important information for our part of the project 
2018-01-23 21:44:24	Janne	i guess the ones currently available 
2018-01-23 21:44:57	Janne	i know we do but i'm not sure if we have the schemas for all the tables yet (hospital and or specialists), or do we? 
2018-01-23 21:46:04	jesse	We don't have a set schema, it would just be whatever is on the csv's. 
2018-01-23 21:46:46	Janne	i figured, we haven't cleaned the other medical facilities yet right? 
2018-01-23 21:47:15	jesse	correct. 
2018-01-23 21:48:44	jesse	I didn't have permission to modify the google sheets so I couldn't do that. 
2018-01-23 21:49:56	Janne	oh ohk that's weird, I can try to give you access? 
2018-01-23 21:50:03	Janne	idk why that keeps happening 
2018-01-23 21:51:42	jesse	I'm not sure. I'll see if theres a way to fix it. 
2018-01-23 21:52:18	Janne	oh wait, did you say you're not using your ncsu acct? 
2018-01-23 21:52:33	jesse	i made the folder... that shouldnt matter 
2018-01-23 21:52:49	Janne	oh you right 
2018-01-23 21:53:18	Janne	which ones can't you acces? 
2018-01-23 21:53:21	Janne	access* 
2018-01-23 21:53:41	Janne	@Janne uploaded a file: https://ncstateuniversityitng.slack.com/files/U8QQDGG2C/F8X2Z0TG9/screen_shot_2018-01-23_at_9.53.11_pm.png (Screen Shot 2018-01-23 at 9.53.11 PM.png) 
2018-01-23 21:54:42	jesse	ahh maybe i was signed in as my ncsu account 
2018-01-23 21:54:59	jesse	i can edit now 
2018-01-23 21:55:50	Janne	yayyyy :smile: 
2018-01-23 21:56:23	jesse	so get this... im signed in as jesse.simpson and when I click a link, it says I'm jlsimps4... 
2018-01-23 21:56:29	Janne	can you note down which columns you remove if you remove any? 
2018-01-23 21:56:35	Janne	lol what link? 
2018-01-23 21:56:48	jesse	any spreadsheet... then I have to manually change the accounts 
2018-01-23 21:58:34	jesse	but yeah I can note down the columns I remove. Honestly, I'm thinkin about just modeling them all after the hospital one and making one ginormous table out of it. 
2018-01-23 21:59:02	Janne	That's what I wanted to do to, but there's seriously a lot more columns in some of the other tables 
2018-01-23 21:59:32	jesse	well we can keep them in separate tables then. 
2018-01-23 21:59:53	jesse	we don't even know how these are going to be used anyway :disappointed: 
2018-01-23 22:00:00	Janne	Sorry for reiterating this but I just want to make sure we aren't deleting any possible data that we don't know that meaning to 
2018-01-23 22:00:06	Janne	Exactly 
2018-01-23 22:00:35	Janne	it would be nice to have a better description that just "rare diseases" lol 
2018-01-23 22:00:40	Janne	it would help a lottt 
2018-01-23 22:01:33	jesse	yeah. We may get that after the meeting with the real people. 
2018-01-23 22:01:58	Janne	i can't go to that meeting :tired_face: 
2018-01-23 22:02:03	Janne	I have class during that time 
2018-01-23 22:02:45	jesse	shoot thats during PLM isn't it?! 
2018-01-23 22:03:54	Janne	yeahhh im pretty sure 
2018-01-23 22:04:08	jesse	Dang!! 
2018-01-23 22:04:20	Janne	I wish I could skip that class, but I cant risk it 
2018-01-23 22:05:42	jesse	it doesn't seem like a hard class, but since its team based, I don't wanna mess up my other team members. 
2018-01-23 22:09:41	jesse	ya know we could just keep all the columns as they are and just query for whatever we need. It's a little bit of a waste in memory tho 
2018-01-23 22:10:16	Janne	yeahh that's what we have to think about 
2018-01-23 22:12:19	jesse	If we keep all of the columns that we don't fully understand... then we are only able to remove columns that don't have a purpose (such as a column with the same value for every entry)... and there aren't many of those 
2018-01-23 22:15:07	jesse	website and ownership are both not available for every entry in nursing homes but in a way, it could be useful to know what information we would not be able to extract... but more than likely, its worthless data 
2018-01-23 22:20:17	jesse	As for the things we are unsure about; if we are unsure about what the data is, then I would imagine that kowolenko wouldn't understand either since he isn't a medical professional.. and then we wouldn't be able to use that data anyway. So we could go for the conservative approach or the trim everything approach. I think its best to keep everything until we know how hospitals and specialists will be used in the system. Its possible that most of this data is irrelevant anyway. [:+1::skin-tone-4:1] 
2018-01-23 22:23:50	jesse	Something more concerning is the fact that we don't yet have a way to match each specialist to a particular hospital... I'm looking at the specialist table now and those columns are mostly blank 
2018-01-30 20:07:42	jesse	Hey Janne, I found a table if ya wanted to join. Im on the 3rd floor. as you come up the stairs, just take a u turn on your left. 
2018-02-04 15:19:54	jesse	Hey Janne, do you have an idea of what you're gonna try to get done for raredx stuff this week? 
2018-02-04 15:20:35	Janne	As of right now I'm creating the attributes from tehrare dx companies to filter into yurika and my own crawler 
2018-02-04 15:20:56	Janne	Also that's what I'll mostly be using to create some sort of table of data 
2018-02-04 15:21:16	jesse	by raredx companies do you mean the list of pharmacies and whatever kowolenko sent us? 
2018-02-04 15:25:00	jesse	Also, I was considering asking meaghan if she could handle the AgensGraph/gephi stuff since Sagar won't be available... but I'm not too sure yet since I may have time to figure that out. 
2018-02-04 15:25:29	Janne	Yeah that's what I meant :slightly_smiling_face: 
2018-02-04 15:25:47	Janne	After I creating my basic tables I was also thinking of tackling that stuff 
2018-02-04 15:25:56	Janne	have you made any progress on that? 
2018-02-04 15:27:35	jesse	not really. I just installed the two programs... its a lil screwy cuz you have to uninstall postgresql for it to work... I think I'm going to try to extract the specialists relation to rare diseases from the pubmed website. and maybe i'll come back to that. 
2018-02-04 15:28:07	Janne	What I'm thinking is that we if we can find some way to have the gephi application work on our application we can import the data from our database as GEXF files. https://gephi.org/users/supported-graph-formats/ 
2018-02-04 15:31:10	Janne	Do you know who uploaded the list_of_rare_dx in our RareDiseases folder? 
2018-02-04 15:32:42	jesse	is that the one that starts with acquired hemophilia? 
2018-02-04 15:32:52	Janne	Yuppp 
2018-02-04 15:33:36	jesse	me. I took that from nords website with curl and used grep to filter the nonsense 
2018-02-04 15:43:33	Janne	Oh ohk. Dr. Kowolenko said that he created the rare diseases table using the data from NORD and GARD. 
2018-02-04 15:44:32	Janne	The disease_names_genes table contains around 30,000 specific diseases. If you want a more extensive list :slightly_smiling_face: 
2018-02-04 15:44:52	Janne	I'm thinking of just connecting to it in my python script to read it. 
2018-02-04 15:45:50	Janne	But in my opinion i think the table in the NCBI database is kinda organized funny. We haven't really be briefed about the whole structured so maybe if we had one we'll get a better understanding. 
2018-02-04 15:46:05	Janne	Thanks for uploading that list! 
2018-02-04 15:49:03	jesse	is that table what dr. kowolenko meant when he mentioned he made a list of the diseases? 
2018-02-04 15:50:06	Janne	There are several "disease" tables in the ncbi database but that one (disease_names...) is the only one I found where the "disease" column has actual disease values. 
2018-02-04 15:50:19	Janne	Other tabled like the pubmed db has a giant description of the database 
2018-02-04 15:51:05	jesse	qjk 
2018-02-04 15:51:13	jesse	didn't mean to send that lol 
2018-02-04 15:51:18	Janne	lololol 
2018-02-04 15:51:30	jesse	trying to do psql stuff in the terminal haha 
2018-02-04 16:13:57	jesse	the issue with the bigger lists of rare diseases is that I cant make yurika crawl 30,000 websites and the websites those queries link to... 
2018-02-04 16:14:46	Janne	true, but another argument is that you might miss some rare diseases 
2018-02-04 16:15:05	Janne	We can always section up the data we use in the crawler 
2018-02-04 16:15:16	Janne	Are you thinking of using your own crawler as well? 
2018-02-04 16:18:36	jesse	I'm using my instance of yurika right now. I might make my own script to specifically search for the authors of each article on pubmed. 
2018-02-04 16:20:45	jesse	its kinda complicated, trying to match up the rare disease to the specialist... and even when I get the information, I'll have no idea if that info is reliable since there are many people with the same name in the US. 
2018-02-04 16:22:51	jesse	maybe I can make a dictionary of the specialists and search on that dictionary with the queries of rare-dx's .... but that would be over 30,000 names 
2018-02-04 16:25:04	jesse	I feel really incompetent when it comes to this project  (-_-) 
2018-02-04 18:32:02	Janne	Me too :tired_face: 
2018-02-04 18:32:09	Janne	Are you running Yurika rn? 
2018-02-04 18:32:29	jesse	no 
2018-02-05 09:33:26	jesse	Let me know if you get around to trying to do the gephi/agensgraph stuff... i had a few dependency issues when I was trying to install and run it 
2018-02-05 12:23:25	Janne	Ohk :slightly_smiling_face: I probably wont be working on it until tomorrow. 
2018-02-05 12:23:33	Janne	Mainly working on Senior Design today 
2018-02-05 12:24:28	jesse	I gotcha. I probably won't do much of this today either. I'm getting kinda tired lol 
2018-02-05 15:10:39	Janne	Me too :disappointed: 
2018-02-05 15:10:47	Janne	But we can totally do this!! 
2018-02-05 21:19:49	jesse	@jesse uploaded a file: https://ncstateuniversityitng.slack.com/files/U8QQFV2GG/F94B5D9EE/sample_data_to_convert_to_csv.js (sample data to convert to csv) and commented: Hey Janne... I've got this big text file filled with rare disease info, and specialist name, but I'm kinda blanking on what the best way to process it. Could you take a look? each entry in the txt file looks like this... 
2018-02-05 21:23:50	jesse	I'd like to make a dataframe out of it all but theres multiple authors and multiple author locations which makes it confusing. 
2018-02-05 21:30:40	jesse	I think I got it. im just bein dumb. 
2018-02-06 08:18:41	Janne	I thought I ad sent this yesterday: "Yeah sure! I won't be working on this until tomorrow though :disappointed: I have a senior design tonight" 
2018-02-06 09:43:40	jesse	thats ok. i made a csv out of it. its ugly tho 
2018-02-07 19:25:40	Janne	Ohk I'm getting really frustrated at Sagar rn lol 
2018-02-07 19:31:56	jesse	whys that? im not lookin at the messages rn, im doin laundry 
2018-02-07 19:34:00	Janne	Lol it's all good. He's helping now but literally I was asking him for an example of one line of code and he gave me references to things I had that didn't have. But it's all good now lol I was getting frustrated for a little bit 
2018-02-07 19:36:29	jesse	gotcha. i tried understanding the question but I don't really understand the context. Glad it worked out. 
2018-02-11 09:13:30	jesse	Hey Janne, do you understand the PLM homework? 
2018-02-12 10:06:57	Janne	Hey! Sorry for the late response. No i dont really understand what's going on. 
2018-02-12 10:07:17	Janne	But i saw Alex Phelp's post 
2018-02-12 10:07:28	Janne	I think that'll help but I haven't read it yet 
2018-02-12 10:08:21	jesse	oh thats ok. i saw that too. i ended up just doing something that looks like it could be right and submitting it... i spent too much time trying to interpret it. 
2018-02-13 10:08:12	Janne	Rightt I'm on that problem now. 
2018-02-13 10:08:26	Janne	Do you think you have any time to meet before class starts? 
2018-02-13 10:09:10	jesse	about raredx stuff or the plm homework? 
2018-02-13 10:33:26	jesse	not that it changes my answer. I can meet up, but I wont be much use to you for the plm assignment 
2018-02-13 10:45:44	jesse	Just let me know if ya want to meet. I'm available all day except for plm class time. [:+1::skin-tone-4:1] 
2018-02-13 13:17:18	jesse	Hey Janne, how is crawling the drug companies going? and how is linking specialists with raredx from pubmed? 
2018-02-13 13:21:37	Janne	Can we meet after my senior design class? We get out around 2:40PM 
2018-02-13 13:21:44	jesse	Sure thing 
2018-02-13 14:44:34	jesse	I have a table on the 3rd floor behind the printers 
2018-02-15 13:10:10	jesse	Did you retain a lot of the last PLM lecture? All that stuff went completely over my head lol. 
2018-02-15 13:10:49	jesse	I'm looking over Menzies notes now 
2018-02-18 16:05:11	jesse	Hey Janne, I got to a point with the pubmed data where I gave the rest of the work to Arun and I'm free to do other things. How is the drug company stuff going? 
2018-02-18 17:14:30	jesse	Let me know if you want me to help. As for the pubmed data, I got the script to make a CSV. its about a gigabyte big and is mildly buggy so I let Arun handle it since there isn't a whole lot of work to do now that the CSV is populating. 
2018-02-19 08:32:00	Janne	Hey there! Would you be down to work on DrugCo later today? 
2018-02-19 09:23:08	jesse	I'll be free after 5pm. I've got some classes on main on Monday/Wednesday. 
2018-02-19 10:47:26	Janne	I can do after 5 on main :slightly_smiling_face: 
2018-02-19 10:48:36	jesse	ok. If it's on main, I'll be available as soon as 4:15 and will also be available 1 - 3 (but i usually use that time for homework.) 
2018-02-19 15:01:09	Janne	Would you want to work on Main or Hunt? 
2018-02-19 15:01:21	Janne	I can be there after 5. Better parking for both options :slightly_smiling_face: 
2018-02-19 15:42:20	jesse	I can be at either places. My preference would probably be hunt though 
2018-02-19 16:22:57	Janne	That's fine with me too! So I'm in durham and its about rush hour :expressionless: would it be cool if we meet closer to 6:-6:30 when the traffic has died. 
2018-02-19 16:35:52	jesse	Sounds good! I'm making dinner now so I was actually just about to text you that id be late 
2018-02-19 20:32:18	jesse	Hey Janne, I found a website you've probably already seen, but i'll share it anyway. https://clinicaltrials.gov for the clinical trials.  It wouldn't help with the other information we need though.
2018-02-19 20:32:18		Home - ClinicalTrials.gov 
2018-02-19 22:22:55	jesse	One of my group member completed his role of implementing crazy eight. so happy. pretty sure the solitaire guy hasnt started though. still though. its a nice feeling. Good luck with your group's meeting. 
2018-02-19 22:26:18	jesse	And my part of the project is almost done :slightly_smiling_face: 
2018-02-19 22:36:31	jesse	Oh, and Arun got back to me saying he can run stuff in yurika. I told him to contact you. Id be free to meet up again tomorrow after class or Wednesday night if you think i could be of assistance for anything drug company related... but i felt pretty worthless today haha. 
2018-02-19 22:36:31		If Arun's yurika thing doesn't work out, we should tell Meaghan we are struggling with the drug companies. 
2018-02-21 16:20:46	jesse	let me know if there's anything i can do to help with the pharma stuff. (if you're working on that.). i reached this strange point where all my homework is done and have nothing else to do but drink tea xD

2018-02-22 17:22:17		Derek Banas: Lisp Tutorial 
2018-02-23 07:47:39	jesse	hey Janne, id be free to meet today before 4:30 if ya wanna do raredx stuff.  
2018-02-23 07:56:37	jesse	though that may be difficult if you need to park somewhere 
2018-02-23 13:08:48	Janne	Hey Jesse! I actually can't meet today. I just realized I have a test for my other class that I haven't studied for. That's my main priority today :disappointed: 
2018-02-23 13:22:05	jesse	that's alright. ive been doing other stuff anyway.  btw I'm not sure if i would use that lisp video you sent. The lisp that menzies is having us learn is kinda different than regular lisp. 
2018-02-23 15:22:14	Janne	Awww ohk /: 
2018-02-23 15:22:20	Janne	Yeah I haven't watched that video yet 
2018-02-23 15:22:29	Janne	Guess I need to just read the pdf he has on the site 
2018-02-23 15:41:16	jesse	i watched the first half of the video. it's pretty good and helped me get used to some of the look and feel for lisp as well as a few added functions that are nice to know.
2018-02-23 15:41:16		that pdf is what test questions will come from though... and that syntax is kinda different... some of it isn't even valid lisp such as the "label" function. 
2018-02-28 19:07:57	Janne	Hey there! Would you happen to know where the LISP pdf is? 
2018-02-28 19:25:52	jesse	i think i can find it. 
2018-02-28 19:28:10	jesse	@jesse uploaded a file: https://ncstateuniversityitng.slack.com/files/U8QQFV2GG/F9GGEV0D9/jmc.ps (jmc.ps)

2018-03-19 22:26:30	jesse	I'm not sure my task for the week is gonna be very fruitful.. so if ya need help with anything regarding the drug company data, just let me know. 
2018-04-01 10:53:10	jesse	Hey Janne, does any of the information you're gathering relate to the social groups for each raredx? And would I find that info on some of the websites you are searching through? 
2018-04-02 15:08:46	Janne	I have seen that some companies do have social groups 
2018-04-02 15:09:05	Janne	http://www.abbviepaf.org/ 
2018-04-02 15:09:23	Janne	I'm not able to get that information from the 10K file though 
2018-04-02 17:10:02	jesse	Thanks for letting me know 
2018-04-08 11:07:52	jesse	I found a better progress bar. check out the progressbar2 pip package. it gives an estimated time, an index/total, percentage and progress bar  
2018-04-17 16:56:57	Janne	when is the final for this class 
2018-04-17 14:58:42		getting channel history...
2018-01-23 11:02:12	Janne	Hey jesse! I'm having trouble accessing power6a. I was wondering if I can get your help before consulting Meaghan. 
2018-01-23 11:02:42	jesse	Ahh good. I really dont wanna work on english right now :) 
2018-01-23 11:02:51	jesse	whats up? 
2018-01-23 11:03:33	Janne	I can't ssh into anything lol, I tried the passwords meaghan gave me but I've been denied permission everytime 
2018-01-23 11:04:08	jesse	youre prompted for a password? 
2018-01-23 11:05:06	Janne	Yeah for http://power6a.oscar.ncsu.edu (power6a.oscar.ncsu.edu) I am but for http://proxy.oscar.ncsu.edu (proxy.oscar.ncsu.edu) I am denied permision 
2018-01-23 11:05:12	Janne	Does it just log in for yours? 
2018-01-23 11:07:22	jesse	yep. Since I gave them my ssh key, all I need to do is run ssh oscar or ssh oscardb.... I also configured that command to connect to http://proxy.oscar.ncsu.edu (proxy.oscar.ncsu.edu)  and http://power6a.oscar.ncsu.edu (power6a.oscar.ncsu.edu) automatically 
2018-01-23 11:07:31	jesse	but no password prompt 
2018-01-23 11:07:39	Janne	yeahhhh that's not happening for me 
2018-01-23 11:07:57	jesse	so you can log into proxy but not power? 
2018-01-23 11:08:00	Janne	I gave her my ssh key but I think something is messed up in my set 
2018-01-23 11:08:06	Janne	I can't log into both 
2018-01-23 11:08:25	jesse	...did you give her your public key or private? 
2018-01-23 11:09:18	Janne	public 
2018-01-23 11:10:08	jesse	you should probably talk to meaghan then. 
2018-01-23 11:10:23	Janne	Oh i know what's happening, when I try to ssh my key that was used can't be found 
2018-01-23 11:10:40	jesse	is it not in the .ssh directory? 
2018-01-23 11:10:47	Janne	it is 
2018-01-23 11:11:05	Janne	but it the output logs when I ssh it doesn't know to search that key? 
2018-01-23 11:11:58	Janne	I'm in!!! :smile: 
2018-01-23 11:12:27	jesse	yeayy! 
2018-01-23 11:13:03	Janne	lol I'm sorry I bothered you 
2018-01-23 11:13:27	jesse	youre good. 
2018-01-23 14:32:27	jesse	Hey Janne, what are you currently working on as far as rare diseases? 
2018-01-23 15:01:46	Janne	I've been slacking on the organs but I'll get that done soon. I was also planning on starting to look at some of the websites we have to crawl, but I was hoping we could section out which websites each member was going to crawl before working on it. 
2018-01-23 15:09:30	jesse	I've been slacking  on this since Friday or something.  i was gonna start crawling  some time since yurika seems pretty simple. would you maybe wanna work on this some after plm? 
2018-01-23 15:26:16	Janne	Yeah sure! 
2018-01-23 15:26:39	jesse	cool! 
2018-01-23 17:49:09	jesse	wanna meet at the library? 
2018-01-23 18:06:41	jesse	Just noticed that there are some urls added with Yurika. I'm guessing you did that? I kinda expected that this would be running locally rather than one shared session between us. Since this is the case, do you think that we should run all of the links at once? 
2018-01-23 18:09:11	jesse	I'm also wondering if the output will be downloaded onto our system or if it will be saved onto their server/db. the latter may be problematic 
2018-01-23 18:13:45	Janne	I did not add them lol but I noticed that as well 
2018-01-23 18:13:59	jesse	it may have been me lol 
2018-01-23 18:14:24	Janne	lol how did that happen? were you able to use Yurika already? (outside of the web version) 
2018-01-23 18:14:53	jesse	pretty sure the web version is the only version 
2018-01-23 18:24:00	Janne	oh lol ohk :sweat_smile: 
2018-01-23 18:25:13	jesse	this things weird. 
2018-01-23 18:29:16	jesse	it seems like you have to know exactly what you want before you start scraping... usually, I would think you would want to get everything downloaded first and then start filtering. 
2018-01-23 18:31:08	jesse	ok so I put a blank mindmap and a query for 'pregnancy'. shall I run the thing and see what happens? 
2018-01-23 18:34:46	jesse	ok so nothing happened... not really surprised lol... is there something we could be doing that doesn't involve yurika? I'm thinkin we should just leave this for after thursdays meeting when they are gonna teach us the thing. [:+1::skin-tone-4:1] 
2018-01-23 18:48:27	jesse	should I go and make the databases? or does more stuff need to be done with the CSV's ? 
2018-01-23 21:41:34	Janne	Oh yeah we do have access to the database? 
2018-01-23 21:41:45	Janne	Oh where can we access the db btw? 
2018-01-23 21:42:00	Janne	Ummm idk if we should just yet 
2018-01-23 21:42:25	jesse	which one? 
2018-01-23 21:43:56	jesse	we have to make the databases for the hospitals and specialists. We have access to a few others but they don't have much important information for our part of the project 
2018-01-23 21:44:24	Janne	i guess the ones currently available 
2018-01-23 21:44:57	Janne	i know we do but i'm not sure if we have the schemas for all the tables yet (hospital and or specialists), or do we? 
2018-01-23 21:46:04	jesse	We don't have a set schema, it would just be whatever is on the csv's. 
2018-01-23 21:46:46	Janne	i figured, we haven't cleaned the other medical facilities yet right? 
2018-01-23 21:47:15	jesse	correct. 
2018-01-23 21:48:44	jesse	I didn't have permission to modify the google sheets so I couldn't do that. 
2018-01-23 21:49:56	Janne	oh ohk that's weird, I can try to give you access? 
2018-01-23 21:50:03	Janne	idk why that keeps happening 
2018-01-23 21:51:42	jesse	I'm not sure. I'll see if theres a way to fix it. 
2018-01-23 21:52:18	Janne	oh wait, did you say you're not using your ncsu acct? 
2018-01-23 21:52:33	jesse	i made the folder... that shouldnt matter 
2018-01-23 21:52:49	Janne	oh you right 
2018-01-23 21:53:18	Janne	which ones can't you acces? 
2018-01-23 21:53:21	Janne	access* 
2018-01-23 21:53:41	Janne	@Janne uploaded a file: https://ncstateuniversityitng.slack.com/files/U8QQDGG2C/F8X2Z0TG9/screen_shot_2018-01-23_at_9.53.11_pm.png (Screen Shot 2018-01-23 at 9.53.11 PM.png) 
2018-01-23 21:54:42	jesse	ahh maybe i was signed in as my ncsu account 
2018-01-23 21:54:59	jesse	i can edit now 
2018-01-23 21:55:50	Janne	yayyyy :smile: 
2018-01-23 21:56:23	jesse	so get this... im signed in as jesse.simpson and when I click a link, it says I'm jlsimps4... 
2018-01-23 21:56:29	Janne	can you note down which columns you remove if you remove any? 
2018-01-23 21:56:35	Janne	lol what link? 
2018-01-23 21:56:48	jesse	any spreadsheet... then I have to manually change the accounts 
2018-01-23 21:58:34	jesse	but yeah I can note down the columns I remove. Honestly, I'm thinkin about just modeling them all after the hospital one and making one ginormous table out of it. 
2018-01-23 21:59:02	Janne	That's what I wanted to do to, but there's seriously a lot more columns in some of the other tables 
2018-01-23 21:59:32	jesse	well we can keep them in separate tables then. 
2018-01-23 21:59:53	jesse	we don't even know how these are going to be used anyway :disappointed: 
2018-01-23 22:00:00	Janne	Sorry for reiterating this but I just want to make sure we aren't deleting any possible data that we don't know that meaning to 
2018-01-23 22:00:06	Janne	Exactly 
2018-01-23 22:00:35	Janne	it would be nice to have a better description that just "rare diseases" lol 
2018-01-23 22:00:40	Janne	it would help a lottt 
2018-01-23 22:01:33	jesse	yeah. We may get that after the meeting with the real people. 
2018-01-23 22:01:58	Janne	i can't go to that meeting :tired_face: 
2018-01-23 22:02:03	Janne	I have class during that time 
2018-01-23 22:02:45	jesse	shoot thats during PLM isn't it?! 
2018-01-23 22:03:54	Janne	yeahhh im pretty sure 
2018-01-23 22:04:08	jesse	Dang!! 
2018-01-23 22:04:20	Janne	I wish I could skip that class, but I cant risk it 
2018-01-23 22:05:42	jesse	it doesn't seem like a hard class, but since its team based, I don't wanna mess up my other team members. 
2018-01-23 22:09:41	jesse	ya know we could just keep all the columns as they are and just query for whatever we need. It's a little bit of a waste in memory tho 
2018-01-23 22:10:16	Janne	yeahh that's what we have to think about 
2018-01-23 22:12:19	jesse	If we keep all of the columns that we don't fully understand... then we are only able to remove columns that don't have a purpose (such as a column with the same value for every entry)... and there aren't many of those 
2018-01-23 22:15:07	jesse	website and ownership are both not available for every entry in nursing homes but in a way, it could be useful to know what information we would not be able to extract... but more than likely, its worthless data 
2018-01-23 22:20:17	jesse	As for the things we are unsure about; if we are unsure about what the data is, then I would imagine that kowolenko wouldn't understand either since he isn't a medical professional.. and then we wouldn't be able to use that data anyway. So we could go for the conservative approach or the trim everything approach. I think its best to keep everything until we know how hospitals and specialists will be used in the system. Its possible that most of this data is irrelevant anyway. [:+1::skin-tone-4:1] 
2018-01-23 22:23:50	jesse	Something more concerning is the fact that we don't yet have a way to match each specialist to a particular hospital... I'm looking at the specialist table now and those columns are mostly blank 
2018-01-30 20:07:42	jesse	Hey Janne, I found a table if ya wanted to join. Im on the 3rd floor. as you come up the stairs, just take a u turn on your left. 
2018-02-04 15:19:54	jesse	Hey Janne, do you have an idea of what you're gonna try to get done for raredx stuff this week? 
2018-02-04 15:20:35	Janne	As of right now I'm creating the attributes from tehrare dx companies to filter into yurika and my own crawler 
2018-02-04 15:20:56	Janne	Also that's what I'll mostly be using to create some sort of table of data 
2018-02-04 15:21:16	jesse	by raredx companies do you mean the list of pharmacies and whatever kowolenko sent us? 
2018-02-04 15:25:00	jesse	Also, I was considering asking meaghan if she could handle the AgensGraph/gephi stuff since Sagar won't be available... but I'm not too sure yet since I may have time to figure that out. 
2018-02-04 15:25:29	Janne	Yeah that's what I meant :slightly_smiling_face: 
2018-02-04 15:25:47	Janne	After I creating my basic tables I was also thinking of tackling that stuff 
2018-02-04 15:25:56	Janne	have you made any progress on that? 
2018-02-04 15:27:35	jesse	not really. I just installed the two programs... its a lil screwy cuz you have to uninstall postgresql for it to work... I think I'm going to try to extract the specialists relation to rare diseases from the pubmed website. and maybe i'll come back to that. 
2018-02-04 15:28:07	Janne	What I'm thinking is that we if we can find some way to have the gephi application work on our application we can import the data from our database as GEXF files. https://gephi.org/users/supported-graph-formats/ 
2018-02-04 15:31:10	Janne	Do you know who uploaded the list_of_rare_dx in our RareDiseases folder? 
2018-02-04 15:32:42	jesse	is that the one that starts with acquired hemophilia? 
2018-02-04 15:32:52	Janne	Yuppp 
2018-02-04 15:33:36	jesse	me. I took that from nords website with curl and used grep to filter the nonsense 
2018-02-04 15:43:33	Janne	Oh ohk. Dr. Kowolenko said that he created the rare diseases table using the data from NORD and GARD. 
2018-02-04 15:44:32	Janne	The disease_names_genes table contains around 30,000 specific diseases. If you want a more extensive list :slightly_smiling_face: 
2018-02-04 15:44:52	Janne	I'm thinking of just connecting to it in my python script to read it. 
2018-02-04 15:45:50	Janne	But in my opinion i think the table in the NCBI database is kinda organized funny. We haven't really be briefed about the whole structured so maybe if we had one we'll get a better understanding. 
2018-02-04 15:46:05	Janne	Thanks for uploading that list! 
2018-02-04 15:49:03	jesse	is that table what dr. kowolenko meant when he mentioned he made a list of the diseases? 
2018-02-04 15:50:06	Janne	There are several "disease" tables in the ncbi database but that one (disease_names...) is the only one I found where the "disease" column has actual disease values. 
2018-02-04 15:50:19	Janne	Other tabled like the pubmed db has a giant description of the database 
2018-02-04 15:51:05	jesse	qjk 
2018-02-04 15:51:13	jesse	didn't mean to send that lol 
2018-02-04 15:51:18	Janne	lololol 
2018-02-04 15:51:30	jesse	trying to do psql stuff in the terminal haha 
2018-02-04 16:13:57	jesse	the issue with the bigger lists of rare diseases is that I cant make yurika crawl 30,000 websites and the websites those queries link to... 
2018-02-04 16:14:46	Janne	true, but another argument is that you might miss some rare diseases 
2018-02-04 16:15:05	Janne	We can always section up the data we use in the crawler 
2018-02-04 16:15:16	Janne	Are you thinking of using your own crawler as well? 
2018-02-04 16:18:36	jesse	I'm using my instance of yurika right now. I might make my own script to specifically search for the authors of each article on pubmed. 
2018-02-04 16:20:45	jesse	its kinda complicated, trying to match up the rare disease to the specialist... and even when I get the information, I'll have no idea if that info is reliable since there are many people with the same name in the US. 
2018-02-04 16:22:51	jesse	maybe I can make a dictionary of the specialists and search on that dictionary with the queries of rare-dx's .... but that would be over 30,000 names 
2018-02-04 16:25:04	jesse	I feel really incompetent when it comes to this project  (-_-) 
2018-02-04 18:32:02	Janne	Me too :tired_face: 
2018-02-04 18:32:09	Janne	Are you running Yurika rn? 
2018-02-04 18:32:29	jesse	no 
2018-02-05 09:33:26	jesse	Let me know if you get around to trying to do the gephi/agensgraph stuff... i had a few dependency issues when I was trying to install and run it 
2018-02-05 12:23:25	Janne	Ohk :slightly_smiling_face: I probably wont be working on it until tomorrow. 
2018-02-05 12:23:33	Janne	Mainly working on Senior Design today 
2018-02-05 12:24:28	jesse	I gotcha. I probably won't do much of this today either. I'm getting kinda tired lol 
2018-02-05 15:10:39	Janne	Me too :disappointed: 
2018-02-05 15:10:47	Janne	But we can totally do this!! 
2018-02-05 21:19:49	jesse	@jesse uploaded a file: https://ncstateuniversityitng.slack.com/files/U8QQFV2GG/F94B5D9EE/sample_data_to_convert_to_csv.js (sample data to convert to csv) and commented: Hey Janne... I've got this big text file filled with rare disease info, and specialist name, but I'm kinda blanking on what the best way to process it. Could you take a look? each entry in the txt file looks like this... 
2018-02-05 21:23:50	jesse	I'd like to make a dataframe out of it all but theres multiple authors and multiple author locations which makes it confusing. 
2018-02-05 21:30:40	jesse	I think I got it. im just bein dumb. 
2018-02-06 08:18:41	Janne	I thought I ad sent this yesterday: "Yeah sure! I won't be working on this until tomorrow though :disappointed: I have a senior design tonight" 
2018-02-06 09:43:40	jesse	thats ok. i made a csv out of it. its ugly tho 
2018-02-07 19:25:40	Janne	Ohk I'm getting really frustrated at Sagar rn lol 
2018-02-07 19:31:56	jesse	whys that? im not lookin at the messages rn, im doin laundry 
2018-02-07 19:34:00	Janne	Lol it's all good. He's helping now but literally I was asking him for an example of one line of code and he gave me references to things I had that didn't have. But it's all good now lol I was getting frustrated for a little bit 
2018-02-07 19:36:29	jesse	gotcha. i tried understanding the question but I don't really understand the context. Glad it worked out. 
2018-02-11 09:13:30	jesse	Hey Janne, do you understand the PLM homework? 
2018-02-12 10:06:57	Janne	Hey! Sorry for the late response. No i dont really understand what's going on. 
2018-02-12 10:07:17	Janne	But i saw Alex Phelp's post 
2018-02-12 10:07:28	Janne	I think that'll help but I haven't read it yet 
2018-02-12 10:08:21	jesse	oh thats ok. i saw that too. i ended up just doing something that looks like it could be right and submitting it... i spent too much time trying to interpret it. 
2018-02-13 10:08:12	Janne	Rightt I'm on that problem now. 
2018-02-13 10:08:26	Janne	Do you think you have any time to meet before class starts? 
2018-02-13 10:09:10	jesse	about raredx stuff or the plm homework? 
2018-02-13 10:33:26	jesse	not that it changes my answer. I can meet up, but I wont be much use to you for the plm assignment 
2018-02-13 10:45:44	jesse	Just let me know if ya want to meet. I'm available all day except for plm class time. [:+1::skin-tone-4:1] 
2018-02-13 13:17:18	jesse	Hey Janne, how is crawling the drug companies going? and how is linking specialists with raredx from pubmed? 
2018-02-13 13:21:37	Janne	Can we meet after my senior design class? We get out around 2:40PM 
2018-02-13 13:21:44	jesse	Sure thing 
2018-02-13 14:44:34	jesse	I have a table on the 3rd floor behind the printers 
2018-02-15 13:10:10	jesse	Did you retain a lot of the last PLM lecture? All that stuff went completely over my head lol. 
2018-02-15 13:10:49	jesse	I'm looking over Menzies notes now 
2018-02-18 16:05:11	jesse	Hey Janne, I got to a point with the pubmed data where I gave the rest of the work to Arun and I'm free to do other things. How is the drug company stuff going? 
2018-02-18 17:14:30	jesse	Let me know if you want me to help. As for the pubmed data, I got the script to make a CSV. its about a gigabyte big and is mildly buggy so I let Arun handle it since there isn't a whole lot of work to do now that the CSV is populating. 
2018-02-19 08:32:00	Janne	Hey there! Would you be down to work on DrugCo later today? 
2018-02-19 09:23:08	jesse	I'll be free after 5pm. I've got some classes on main on Monday/Wednesday. 
2018-02-19 10:47:26	Janne	I can do after 5 on main :slightly_smiling_face: 
2018-02-19 10:48:36	jesse	ok. If it's on main, I'll be available as soon as 4:15 and will also be available 1 - 3 (but i usually use that time for homework.) 
2018-02-19 15:01:09	Janne	Would you want to work on Main or Hunt? 
2018-02-19 15:01:21	Janne	I can be there after 5. Better parking for both options :slightly_smiling_face: 
2018-02-19 15:42:20	jesse	I can be at either places. My preference would probably be hunt though 
2018-02-19 16:22:57	Janne	That's fine with me too! So I'm in durham and its about rush hour :expressionless: would it be cool if we meet closer to 6:-6:30 when the traffic has died. 
2018-02-19 16:35:52	jesse	Sounds good! I'm making dinner now so I was actually just about to text you that id be late 
2018-02-19 20:32:18	jesse	Hey Janne, I found a website you've probably already seen, but i'll share it anyway. https://clinicaltrials.gov for the clinical trials.  It wouldn't help with the other information we need though.
2018-02-19 20:32:18		Home - ClinicalTrials.gov 
2018-02-19 22:22:55	jesse	One of my group member completed his role of implementing crazy eight. so happy. pretty sure the solitaire guy hasnt started though. still though. its a nice feeling. Good luck with your group's meeting. 
2018-02-19 22:26:18	jesse	And my part of the project is almost done :slightly_smiling_face: 
2018-02-19 22:36:31	jesse	Oh, and Arun got back to me saying he can run stuff in yurika. I told him to contact you. Id be free to meet up again tomorrow after class or Wednesday night if you think i could be of assistance for anything drug company related... but i felt pretty worthless today haha. 
2018-02-19 22:36:31		If Arun's yurika thing doesn't work out, we should tell Meaghan we are struggling with the drug companies. 
2018-02-21 16:20:46	jesse	let me know if there's anything i can do to help with the pharma stuff. (if you're working on that.). i reached this strange point where all my homework is done and have nothing else to do but drink tea xD 
2018-02-22 17:22:17	Janne	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSq4wHrqyU
2018-02-22 17:22:17		Derek Banas: Lisp Tutorial 
2018-02-23 07:47:39	jesse	hey Janne, id be free to meet today before 4:30 if ya wanna do raredx stuff.  
2018-02-23 07:56:37	jesse	though that may be difficult if you need to park somewhere 
2018-02-23 13:08:48	Janne	Hey Jesse! I actually can't meet today. I just realized I have a test for my other class that I haven't studied for. That's my main priority today :disappointed: 
2018-02-23 13:22:05	jesse	that's alright. ive been doing other stuff anyway.  btw I'm not sure if i would use that lisp video you sent. The lisp that menzies is having us learn is kinda different than regular lisp. 
2018-02-23 15:22:14	Janne	Awww ohk /: 
2018-02-23 15:22:20	Janne	Yeah I haven't watched that video yet 
2018-02-23 15:22:29	Janne	Guess I need to just read the pdf he has on the site 
2018-02-23 15:41:16	jesse	i watched the first half of the video. it's pretty good and helped me get used to some of the look and feel for lisp as well as a few added functions that are nice to know.
2018-02-23 15:41:16		that pdf is what test questions will come from though... and that syntax is kinda different... some of it isn't even valid lisp such as the "label" function. 
2018-02-28 19:07:57	Janne	Hey there! Would you happen to know where the LISP pdf is? 
2018-02-28 19:25:52	jesse	i think i can find it. 
2018-02-28 19:28:10	jesse	@jesse uploaded a file: https://ncstateuniversityitng.slack.com/files/U8QQFV2GG/F9GGEV0D9/jmc.ps (jmc.ps)

2018-03-19 22:26:30	jesse	I'm not sure my task for the week is gonna be very fruitful.. so if ya need help with anything regarding the drug company data, just let me know. 
2018-04-01 10:53:10	jesse	Hey Janne, does any of the information you're gathering relate to the social groups for each raredx? And would I find that info on some of the websites you are searching through? 
2018-04-02 15:08:46	Janne	I have seen that some companies do have social groups 
2018-04-02 15:09:05	Janne	http://www.abbviepaf.org/ 
2018-04-02 15:09:23	Janne	I'm not able to get that information from the 10K file though 
2018-04-02 17:10:02	jesse	Thanks for letting me know 
2018-04-08 11:07:52	jesse	I found a better progress bar. check out the progressbar2 pip package. it gives an estimated time, an index/total, percentage and progress bar  
2018-04-08 16:59:46	Janne	Lol that's pretty awesome!

2018-04-17 16:56:57	Janne	when is the final for this class 
2018-04-17 17:58:29		getting channel history...
2018-01-23 11:02:12	Janne	Hey jesse! I'm having trouble accessing power6a. I was wondering if I can get your help before consulting Meaghan. 
2018-01-23 11:02:42	jesse	Ahh good. I really dont wanna work on english right now :) 
2018-01-23 11:02:51	jesse	whats up? 
2018-01-23 11:03:33	Janne	I can't ssh into anything lol, I tried the passwords meaghan gave me but I've been denied permission everytime 
2018-01-23 11:04:08	jesse	youre prompted for a password? 
2018-01-23 11:05:06	Janne	Yeah for http://power6a.oscar.ncsu.edu (power6a.oscar.ncsu.edu) I am but for http://proxy.oscar.ncsu.edu (proxy.oscar.ncsu.edu) I am denied permision 
2018-01-23 11:05:12	Janne	Does it just log in for yours? 
2018-01-23 11:07:22	jesse	yep. Since I gave them my ssh key, all I need to do is run ssh oscar or ssh oscardb.... I also configured that command to connect to http://proxy.oscar.ncsu.edu (proxy.oscar.ncsu.edu)  and http://power6a.oscar.ncsu.edu (power6a.oscar.ncsu.edu) automatically 
2018-01-23 11:07:31	jesse	but no password prompt 
2018-01-23 11:07:39	Janne	yeahhhh that's not happening for me 
2018-01-23 11:07:57	jesse	so you can log into proxy but not power? 
2018-01-23 11:08:00	Janne	I gave her my ssh key but I think something is messed up in my set 
2018-01-23 11:08:06	Janne	I can't log into both 
2018-01-23 11:08:25	jesse	...did you give her your public key or private? 
2018-01-23 11:09:18	Janne	public 
2018-01-23 11:10:08	jesse	you should probably talk to meaghan then. 
2018-01-23 11:10:23	Janne	Oh i know what's happening, when I try to ssh my key that was used can't be found 
2018-01-23 11:10:40	jesse	is it not in the .ssh directory? 
2018-01-23 11:10:47	Janne	it is 
2018-01-23 11:11:05	Janne	but it the output logs when I ssh it doesn't know to search that key? 
2018-01-23 11:11:58	Janne	I'm in!!! :smile: 
2018-01-23 11:12:27	jesse	yeayy! 
2018-01-23 11:13:03	Janne	lol I'm sorry I bothered you 
2018-01-23 11:13:27	jesse	youre good. 
2018-01-23 14:32:27	jesse	Hey Janne, what are you currently working on as far as rare diseases? 
2018-01-23 15:01:46	Janne	I've been slacking on the organs but I'll get that done soon. I was also planning on starting to look at some of the websites we have to crawl, but I was hoping we could section out which websites each member was going to crawl before working on it. 
2018-01-23 15:09:30	jesse	I've been slacking  on this since Friday or something.  i was gonna start crawling  some time since yurika seems pretty simple. would you maybe wanna work on this some after plm? 
2018-01-23 15:26:16	Janne	Yeah sure! 
2018-01-23 15:26:39	jesse	cool! 
2018-01-23 17:49:09	jesse	wanna meet at the library? 
2018-01-23 18:06:41	jesse	Just noticed that there are some urls added with Yurika. I'm guessing you did that? I kinda expected that this would be running locally rather than one shared session between us. Since this is the case, do you think that we should run all of the links at once? 
2018-01-23 18:09:11	jesse	I'm also wondering if the output will be downloaded onto our system or if it will be saved onto their server/db. the latter may be problematic 
2018-01-23 18:13:45	Janne	I did not add them lol but I noticed that as well 
2018-01-23 18:13:59	jesse	it may have been me lol 
2018-01-23 18:14:24	Janne	lol how did that happen? were you able to use Yurika already? (outside of the web version) 
2018-01-23 18:14:53	jesse	pretty sure the web version is the only version 
2018-01-23 18:24:00	Janne	oh lol ohk :sweat_smile: 
2018-01-23 18:25:13	jesse	this things weird. 
2018-01-23 18:29:16	jesse	it seems like you have to know exactly what you want before you start scraping... usually, I would think you would want to get everything downloaded first and then start filtering. 
2018-01-23 18:31:08	jesse	ok so I put a blank mindmap and a query for 'pregnancy'. shall I run the thing and see what happens? 
2018-01-23 18:34:46	jesse	ok so nothing happened... not really surprised lol... is there something we could be doing that doesn't involve yurika? I'm thinkin we should just leave this for after thursdays meeting when they are gonna teach us the thing. [:+1::skin-tone-4:1] 
2018-01-23 18:48:27	jesse	should I go and make the databases? or does more stuff need to be done with the CSV's ? 
2018-01-23 21:41:34	Janne	Oh yeah we do have access to the database? 
2018-01-23 21:41:45	Janne	Oh where can we access the db btw? 
2018-01-23 21:42:00	Janne	Ummm idk if we should just yet 
2018-01-23 21:42:25	jesse	which one? 
2018-01-23 21:43:56	jesse	we have to make the databases for the hospitals and specialists. We have access to a few others but they don't have much important information for our part of the project 
2018-01-23 21:44:24	Janne	i guess the ones currently available 
2018-01-23 21:44:57	Janne	i know we do but i'm not sure if we have the schemas for all the tables yet (hospital and or specialists), or do we? 
2018-01-23 21:46:04	jesse	We don't have a set schema, it would just be whatever is on the csv's. 
2018-01-23 21:46:46	Janne	i figured, we haven't cleaned the other medical facilities yet right? 
2018-01-23 21:47:15	jesse	correct. 
2018-01-23 21:48:44	jesse	I didn't have permission to modify the google sheets so I couldn't do that. 
2018-01-23 21:49:56	Janne	oh ohk that's weird, I can try to give you access? 
2018-01-23 21:50:03	Janne	idk why that keeps happening 
2018-01-23 21:51:42	jesse	I'm not sure. I'll see if theres a way to fix it. 
2018-01-23 21:52:18	Janne	oh wait, did you say you're not using your ncsu acct? 
2018-01-23 21:52:33	jesse	i made the folder... that shouldnt matter 
2018-01-23 21:52:49	Janne	oh you right 
2018-01-23 21:53:18	Janne	which ones can't you acces? 
2018-01-23 21:53:21	Janne	access* 
2018-01-23 21:53:41	Janne	@Janne uploaded a file: https://ncstateuniversityitng.slack.com/files/U8QQDGG2C/F8X2Z0TG9/screen_shot_2018-01-23_at_9.53.11_pm.png (Screen Shot 2018-01-23 at 9.53.11 PM.png) 
2018-01-23 21:54:42	jesse	ahh maybe i was signed in as my ncsu account 
2018-01-23 21:54:59	jesse	i can edit now 
2018-01-23 21:55:50	Janne	yayyyy :smile: 
2018-01-23 21:56:23	jesse	so get this... im signed in as jesse.simpson and when I click a link, it says I'm jlsimps4... 
2018-01-23 21:56:29	Janne	can you note down which columns you remove if you remove any? 
2018-01-23 21:56:35	Janne	lol what link? 
2018-01-23 21:56:48	jesse	any spreadsheet... then I have to manually change the accounts 
2018-01-23 21:58:34	jesse	but yeah I can note down the columns I remove. Honestly, I'm thinkin about just modeling them all after the hospital one and making one ginormous table out of it. 
2018-01-23 21:59:02	Janne	That's what I wanted to do to, but there's seriously a lot more columns in some of the other tables 
2018-01-23 21:59:32	jesse	well we can keep them in separate tables then. 
2018-01-23 21:59:53	jesse	we don't even know how these are going to be used anyway :disappointed: 
2018-01-23 22:00:00	Janne	Sorry for reiterating this but I just want to make sure we aren't deleting any possible data that we don't know that meaning to 
2018-01-23 22:00:06	Janne	Exactly 
2018-01-23 22:00:35	Janne	it would be nice to have a better description that just "rare diseases" lol 
2018-01-23 22:00:40	Janne	it would help a lottt 
2018-01-23 22:01:33	jesse	yeah. We may get that after the meeting with the real people. 
2018-01-23 22:01:58	Janne	i can't go to that meeting :tired_face: 
2018-01-23 22:02:03	Janne	I have class during that time 
2018-01-23 22:02:45	jesse	shoot thats during PLM isn't it?! 
2018-01-23 22:03:54	Janne	yeahhh im pretty sure 
2018-01-23 22:04:08	jesse	Dang!! 
2018-01-23 22:04:20	Janne	I wish I could skip that class, but I cant risk it 
2018-01-23 22:05:42	jesse	it doesn't seem like a hard class, but since its team based, I don't wanna mess up my other team members. 
2018-01-23 22:09:41	jesse	ya know we could just keep all the columns as they are and just query for whatever we need. It's a little bit of a waste in memory tho 
2018-01-23 22:10:16	Janne	yeahh that's what we have to think about 
2018-01-23 22:12:19	jesse	If we keep all of the columns that we don't fully understand... then we are only able to remove columns that don't have a purpose (such as a column with the same value for every entry)... and there aren't many of those 
2018-01-23 22:15:07	jesse	website and ownership are both not available for every entry in nursing homes but in a way, it could be useful to know what information we would not be able to extract... but more than likely, its worthless data 
2018-01-23 22:20:17	jesse	As for the things we are unsure about; if we are unsure about what the data is, then I would imagine that kowolenko wouldn't understand either since he isn't a medical professional.. and then we wouldn't be able to use that data anyway. So we could go for the conservative approach or the trim everything approach. I think its best to keep everything until we know how hospitals and specialists will be used in the system. Its possible that most of this data is irrelevant anyway. [:+1::skin-tone-4:1] 
2018-01-23 22:23:50	jesse	Something more concerning is the fact that we don't yet have a way to match each specialist to a particular hospital... I'm looking at the specialist table now and those columns are mostly blank 
2018-01-30 20:07:42	jesse	Hey Janne, I found a table if ya wanted to join. Im on the 3rd floor. as you come up the stairs, just take a u turn on your left. 
2018-02-04 15:19:54	jesse	Hey Janne, do you have an idea of what you're gonna try to get done for raredx stuff this week? 
2018-02-04 15:20:35	Janne	As of right now I'm creating the attributes from tehrare dx companies to filter into yurika and my own crawler 
2018-02-04 15:20:56	Janne	Also that's what I'll mostly be using to create some sort of table of data 
2018-02-04 15:21:16	jesse	by raredx companies do you mean the list of pharmacies and whatever kowolenko sent us? 
2018-02-04 15:25:00	jesse	Also, I was considering asking meaghan if she could handle the AgensGraph/gephi stuff since Sagar won't be available... but I'm not too sure yet since I may have time to figure that out. 
2018-02-04 15:25:29	Janne	Yeah that's what I meant :slightly_smiling_face: 
2018-02-04 15:25:47	Janne	After I creating my basic tables I was also thinking of tackling that stuff 
2018-02-04 15:25:56	Janne	have you made any progress on that? 
2018-02-04 15:27:35	jesse	not really. I just installed the two programs... its a lil screwy cuz you have to uninstall postgresql for it to work... I think I'm going to try to extract the specialists relation to rare diseases from the pubmed website. and maybe i'll come back to that. 
2018-02-04 15:28:07	Janne	What I'm thinking is that we if we can find some way to have the gephi application work on our application we can import the data from our database as GEXF files. https://gephi.org/users/supported-graph-formats/ 
2018-02-04 15:31:10	Janne	Do you know who uploaded the list_of_rare_dx in our RareDiseases folder? 
2018-02-04 15:32:42	jesse	is that the one that starts with acquired hemophilia? 
2018-02-04 15:32:52	Janne	Yuppp 
2018-02-04 15:33:36	jesse	me. I took that from nords website with curl and used grep to filter the nonsense 
2018-02-04 15:43:33	Janne	Oh ohk. Dr. Kowolenko said that he created the rare diseases table using the data from NORD and GARD. 
2018-02-04 15:44:32	Janne	The disease_names_genes table contains around 30,000 specific diseases. If you want a more extensive list :slightly_smiling_face: 
2018-02-04 15:44:52	Janne	I'm thinking of just connecting to it in my python script to read it. 
2018-02-04 15:45:50	Janne	But in my opinion i think the table in the NCBI database is kinda organized funny. We haven't really be briefed about the whole structured so maybe if we had one we'll get a better understanding. 
2018-02-04 15:46:05	Janne	Thanks for uploading that list! 
2018-02-04 15:49:03	jesse	is that table what dr. kowolenko meant when he mentioned he made a list of the diseases? 
2018-02-04 15:50:06	Janne	There are several "disease" tables in the ncbi database but that one (disease_names...) is the only one I found where the "disease" column has actual disease values. 
2018-02-04 15:50:19	Janne	Other tabled like the pubmed db has a giant description of the database 
2018-02-04 15:51:05	jesse	qjk 
2018-02-04 15:51:13	jesse	didn't mean to send that lol 
2018-02-04 15:51:18	Janne	lololol 
2018-02-04 15:51:30	jesse	trying to do psql stuff in the terminal haha 
2018-02-04 16:13:57	jesse	the issue with the bigger lists of rare diseases is that I cant make yurika crawl 30,000 websites and the websites those queries link to... 
2018-02-04 16:14:46	Janne	true, but another argument is that you might miss some rare diseases 
2018-02-04 16:15:05	Janne	We can always section up the data we use in the crawler 
2018-02-04 16:15:16	Janne	Are you thinking of using your own crawler as well? 
2018-02-04 16:18:36	jesse	I'm using my instance of yurika right now. I might make my own script to specifically search for the authors of each article on pubmed. 
2018-02-04 16:20:45	jesse	its kinda complicated, trying to match up the rare disease to the specialist... and even when I get the information, I'll have no idea if that info is reliable since there are many people with the same name in the US. 
2018-02-04 16:22:51	jesse	maybe I can make a dictionary of the specialists and search on that dictionary with the queries of rare-dx's .... but that would be over 30,000 names 
2018-02-04 16:25:04	jesse	I feel really incompetent when it comes to this project  (-_-) 
2018-02-04 18:32:02	Janne	Me too :tired_face: 
2018-02-04 18:32:09	Janne	Are you running Yurika rn? 
2018-02-04 18:32:29	jesse	no 
2018-02-05 09:33:26	jesse	Let me know if you get around to trying to do the gephi/agensgraph stuff... i had a few dependency issues when I was trying to install and run it 
2018-02-05 12:23:25	Janne	Ohk :slightly_smiling_face: I probably wont be working on it until tomorrow. 
2018-02-05 12:23:33	Janne	Mainly working on Senior Design today 
2018-02-05 12:24:28	jesse	I gotcha. I probably won't do much of this today either. I'm getting kinda tired lol 
2018-02-05 15:10:39	Janne	Me too :disappointed: 
2018-02-05 15:10:47	Janne	But we can totally do this!! 
2018-02-05 21:19:49	jesse	@jesse uploaded a file: https://ncstateuniversityitng.slack.com/files/U8QQFV2GG/F94B5D9EE/sample_data_to_convert_to_csv.js (sample data to convert to csv) and commented: Hey Janne... I've got this big text file filled with rare disease info, and specialist name, but I'm kinda blanking on what the best way to process it. Could you take a look? each entry in the txt file looks like this... 
2018-02-05 21:23:50	jesse	I'd like to make a dataframe out of it all but theres multiple authors and multiple author locations which makes it confusing. 
2018-02-05 21:30:40	jesse	I think I got it. im just bein dumb. 
2018-02-06 08:18:41	Janne	I thought I ad sent this yesterday: "Yeah sure! I won't be working on this until tomorrow though :disappointed: I have a senior design tonight" 
2018-02-06 09:43:40	jesse	thats ok. i made a csv out of it. its ugly tho 
2018-02-07 19:25:40	Janne	Ohk I'm getting really frustrated at Sagar rn lol 
2018-02-07 19:31:56	jesse	whys that? im not lookin at the messages rn, im doin laundry 
2018-02-07 19:34:00	Janne	Lol it's all good. He's helping now but literally I was asking him for an example of one line of code and he gave me references to things I had that didn't have. But it's all good now lol I was getting frustrated for a little bit 
2018-02-07 19:36:29	jesse	gotcha. i tried understanding the question but I don't really understand the context. Glad it worked out. 
2018-02-11 09:13:30	jesse	Hey Janne, do you understand the PLM homework? 
2018-02-12 10:06:57	Janne	Hey! Sorry for the late response. No i dont really understand what's going on. 
2018-02-12 10:07:17	Janne	But i saw Alex Phelp's post 
2018-02-12 10:07:28	Janne	I think that'll help but I haven't read it yet 
2018-02-12 10:08:21	jesse	oh thats ok. i saw that too. i ended up just doing something that looks like it could be right and submitting it... i spent too much time trying to interpret it. 
2018-02-13 10:08:12	Janne	Rightt I'm on that problem now. 
2018-02-13 10:08:26	Janne	Do you think you have any time to meet before class starts? 
2018-02-13 10:09:10	jesse	about raredx stuff or the plm homework? 
2018-02-13 10:33:26	jesse	not that it changes my answer. I can meet up, but I wont be much use to you for the plm assignment 
2018-02-13 10:45:44	jesse	Just let me know if ya want to meet. I'm available all day except for plm class time. [:+1::skin-tone-4:1] 
2018-02-13 13:17:18	jesse	Hey Janne, how is crawling the drug companies going? and how is linking specialists with raredx from pubmed? 
2018-02-13 13:21:37	Janne	Can we meet after my senior design class? We get out around 2:40PM 
2018-02-13 13:21:44	jesse	Sure thing 
2018-02-13 14:44:34	jesse	I have a table on the 3rd floor behind the printers 
2018-02-15 13:10:10	jesse	Did you retain a lot of the last PLM lecture? All that stuff went completely over my head lol. 
2018-02-15 13:10:49	jesse	I'm looking over Menzies notes now 
2018-02-18 16:05:11	jesse	Hey Janne, I got to a point with the pubmed data where I gave the rest of the work to Arun and I'm free to do other things. How is the drug company stuff going? 
2018-02-18 17:14:30	jesse	Let me know if you want me to help. As for the pubmed data, I got the script to make a CSV. its about a gigabyte big and is mildly buggy so I let Arun handle it since there isn't a whole lot of work to do now that the CSV is populating. 
2018-02-19 08:32:00	Janne	Hey there! Would you be down to work on DrugCo later today? 
2018-02-19 09:23:08	jesse	I'll be free after 5pm. I've got some classes on main on Monday/Wednesday. 
2018-02-19 10:47:26	Janne	I can do after 5 on main :slightly_smiling_face: 
2018-02-19 10:48:36	jesse	ok. If it's on main, I'll be available as soon as 4:15 and will also be available 1 - 3 (but i usually use that time for homework.) 
2018-02-19 15:01:09	Janne	Would you want to work on Main or Hunt? 
2018-02-19 15:01:21	Janne	I can be there after 5. Better parking for both options :slightly_smiling_face: 
2018-02-19 15:42:20	jesse	I can be at either places. My preference would probably be hunt though 
2018-02-19 16:22:57	Janne	That's fine with me too! So I'm in durham and its about rush hour :expressionless: would it be cool if we meet closer to 6:-6:30 when the traffic has died. 
2018-02-19 16:35:52	jesse	Sounds good! I'm making dinner now so I was actually just about to text you that id be late 
2018-02-19 20:32:18	jesse	Hey Janne, I found a website you've probably already seen, but i'll share it anyway. https://clinicaltrials.gov for the clinical trials.  It wouldn't help with the other information we need though.
2018-02-19 20:32:18		Home - ClinicalTrials.gov 
2018-02-19 22:22:55	jesse	One of my group member completed his role of implementing crazy eight. so happy. pretty sure the solitaire guy hasnt started though. still though. its a nice feeling. Good luck with your group's meeting. 
2018-02-19 22:26:18	jesse	And my part of the project is almost done :slightly_smiling_face: 
2018-02-19 22:36:31	jesse	Oh, and Arun got back to me saying he can run stuff in yurika. I told him to contact you. Id be free to meet up again tomorrow after class or Wednesday night if you think i could be of assistance for anything drug company related... but i felt pretty worthless today haha. 
2018-02-19 22:36:31		If Arun's yurika thing doesn't work out, we should tell Meaghan we are struggling with the drug companies. 
2018-02-21 16:20:46	jesse	let me know if there's anything i can do to help with the pharma stuff. (if you're working on that.). i reached this strange point where all my homework is done and have nothing else to do but drink tea xD

2018-02-23 07:47:39	jesse	hey Janne, id be free to meet today before 4:30 if ya wanna do raredx stuff.  
2018-02-23 07:56:37	jesse	though that may be difficult if you need to park somewhere 
2018-02-23 13:08:48	Janne	Hey Jesse! I actually can't meet today. I just realized I have a test for my other class that I haven't studied for. That's my main priority today :disappointed: 
2018-02-23 13:22:05	jesse	that's alright. ive been doing other stuff anyway.  btw I'm not sure if i would use that lisp video you sent. The lisp that menzies is having us learn is kinda different than regular lisp. 
2018-02-23 15:22:14	Janne	Awww ohk /: 
2018-02-23 15:22:20	Janne	Yeah I haven't watched that video yet 
2018-02-23 15:22:29	Janne	Guess I need to just read the pdf he has on the site 
2018-02-23 15:41:16	jesse	i watched the first half of the video. it's pretty good and helped me get used to some of the look and feel for lisp as well as a few added functions that are nice to know.
2018-02-23 15:41:16		that pdf is what test questions will come from though... and that syntax is kinda different... some of it isn't even valid lisp such as the "label" function. 
2018-02-28 19:07:57	Janne	Hey there! Would you happen to know where the LISP pdf is? 
2018-02-28 19:25:52	jesse	i think i can find it. 
2018-02-28 19:28:10	jesse	@jesse uploaded a file: https://ncstateuniversityitng.slack.com/files/U8QQFV2GG/F9GGEV0D9/jmc.ps (jmc.ps)

2018-03-19 22:26:30	jesse	I'm not sure my task for the week is gonna be very fruitful.. so if ya need help with anything regarding the drug company data, just let me know. 
2018-04-01 10:53:10	jesse	Hey Janne, does any of the information you're gathering relate to the social groups for each raredx? And would I find that info on some of the websites you are searching through? 
2018-04-02 15:08:46	Janne	I have seen that some companies do have social groups 
2018-04-02 15:09:05	Janne	http://www.abbviepaf.org/ 
2018-04-02 15:09:23	Janne	I'm not able to get that information from the 10K file though 
2018-04-02 17:10:02	jesse	Thanks for letting me know 
2018-04-08 11:07:52	jesse	I found a better progress bar. check out the progressbar2 pip package. it gives an estimated time, an index/total, percentage and progress bar  
2018-04-08 16:59:46	Janne	Lol that's pretty awesome!

2018-04-17 16:56:57	Janne	when is the final for this class 
2018-04-17 17:59:09	jesse	I emailed Dr. Adams about that regulation I showed you for PLM. I didn't wanna talk to menzies. 
2018-04-17 18:10:49		getting channel history...
2018-01-23 11:02:12	Janne	Hey jesse! I'm having trouble accessing power6a. I was wondering if I can get your help before consulting Meaghan. 
2018-01-23 11:02:42	jesse	Ahh good. I really dont wanna work on english right now :) 
2018-01-23 11:02:51	jesse	whats up? 
2018-01-23 11:03:33	Janne	I can't ssh into anything lol, I tried the passwords meaghan gave me but I've been denied permission everytime 
2018-01-23 11:04:08	jesse	youre prompted for a password? 
2018-01-23 11:05:06	Janne	Yeah for http://power6a.oscar.ncsu.edu (power6a.oscar.ncsu.edu) I am but for http://proxy.oscar.ncsu.edu (proxy.oscar.ncsu.edu) I am denied permision 
2018-01-23 11:05:12	Janne	Does it just log in for yours? 
2018-01-23 11:07:22	jesse	yep. Since I gave them my ssh key, all I need to do is run ssh oscar or ssh oscardb.... I also configured that command to connect to http://proxy.oscar.ncsu.edu (proxy.oscar.ncsu.edu)  and http://power6a.oscar.ncsu.edu (power6a.oscar.ncsu.edu) automatically 
2018-01-23 11:07:31	jesse	but no password prompt 
2018-01-23 11:07:39	Janne	yeahhhh that's not happening for me 
2018-01-23 11:07:57	jesse	so you can log into proxy but not power? 
2018-01-23 11:08:00	Janne	I gave her my ssh key but I think something is messed up in my set 
2018-01-23 11:08:06	Janne	I can't log into both 
2018-01-23 11:08:25	jesse	...did you give her your public key or private? 
2018-01-23 11:09:18	Janne	public 
2018-01-23 11:10:08	jesse	you should probably talk to meaghan then. 
2018-01-23 11:10:23	Janne	Oh i know what's happening, when I try to ssh my key that was used can't be found 
2018-01-23 11:10:40	jesse	is it not in the .ssh directory? 
2018-01-23 11:10:47	Janne	it is 
2018-01-23 11:11:05	Janne	but it the output logs when I ssh it doesn't know to search that key? 
2018-01-23 11:11:58	Janne	I'm in!!! :smile: 
2018-01-23 11:12:27	jesse	yeayy! 
2018-01-23 11:13:03	Janne	lol I'm sorry I bothered you 
2018-01-23 11:13:27	jesse	youre good. 
2018-01-23 14:32:27	jesse	Hey Janne, what are you currently working on as far as rare diseases? 
2018-01-23 15:01:46	Janne	I've been slacking on the organs but I'll get that done soon. I was also planning on starting to look at some of the websites we have to crawl, but I was hoping we could section out which websites each member was going to crawl before working on it. 
2018-01-23 15:09:30	jesse	I've been slacking  on this since Friday or something.  i was gonna start crawling  some time since yurika seems pretty simple. would you maybe wanna work on this some after plm? 
2018-01-23 15:26:16	Janne	Yeah sure! 
2018-01-23 15:26:39	jesse	cool! 
2018-01-23 17:49:09	jesse	wanna meet at the library? 
2018-01-23 18:06:41	jesse	Just noticed that there are some urls added with Yurika. I'm guessing you did that? I kinda expected that this would be running locally rather than one shared session between us. Since this is the case, do you think that we should run all of the links at once? 
2018-01-23 18:09:11	jesse	I'm also wondering if the output will be downloaded onto our system or if it will be saved onto their server/db. the latter may be problematic 
2018-01-23 18:13:45	Janne	I did not add them lol but I noticed that as well 
2018-01-23 18:13:59	jesse	it may have been me lol 
2018-01-23 18:14:24	Janne	lol how did that happen? were you able to use Yurika already? (outside of the web version) 
2018-01-23 18:14:53	jesse	pretty sure the web version is the only version 
2018-01-23 18:24:00	Janne	oh lol ohk :sweat_smile: 
2018-01-23 18:25:13	jesse	this things weird. 
2018-01-23 18:29:16	jesse	it seems like you have to know exactly what you want before you start scraping... usually, I would think you would want to get everything downloaded first and then start filtering. 
2018-01-23 18:31:08	jesse	ok so I put a blank mindmap and a query for 'pregnancy'. shall I run the thing and see what happens? 
2018-01-23 18:34:46	jesse	ok so nothing happened... not really surprised lol... is there something we could be doing that doesn't involve yurika? I'm thinkin we should just leave this for after thursdays meeting when they are gonna teach us the thing. [:+1::skin-tone-4:1] 
2018-01-23 18:48:27	jesse	should I go and make the databases? or does more stuff need to be done with the CSV's ? 
2018-01-23 21:41:34	Janne	Oh yeah we do have access to the database? 
2018-01-23 21:41:45	Janne	Oh where can we access the db btw? 
2018-01-23 21:42:00	Janne	Ummm idk if we should just yet 
2018-01-23 21:42:25	jesse	which one? 
2018-01-23 21:43:56	jesse	we have to make the databases for the hospitals and specialists. We have access to a few others but they don't have much important information for our part of the project 
2018-01-23 21:44:24	Janne	i guess the ones currently available 
2018-01-23 21:44:57	Janne	i know we do but i'm not sure if we have the schemas for all the tables yet (hospital and or specialists), or do we? 
2018-01-23 21:46:04	jesse	We don't have a set schema, it would just be whatever is on the csv's. 
2018-01-23 21:46:46	Janne	i figured, we haven't cleaned the other medical facilities yet right? 
2018-01-23 21:47:15	jesse	correct. 
2018-01-23 21:48:44	jesse	I didn't have permission to modify the google sheets so I couldn't do that. 
2018-01-23 21:49:56	Janne	oh ohk that's weird, I can try to give you access? 
2018-01-23 21:50:03	Janne	idk why that keeps happening 
2018-01-23 21:51:42	jesse	I'm not sure. I'll see if theres a way to fix it. 
2018-01-23 21:52:18	Janne	oh wait, did you say you're not using your ncsu acct? 
2018-01-23 21:52:33	jesse	i made the folder... that shouldnt matter 
2018-01-23 21:52:49	Janne	oh you right 
2018-01-23 21:53:18	Janne	which ones can't you acces? 
2018-01-23 21:53:21	Janne	access* 
2018-01-23 21:53:41	Janne	@Janne uploaded a file: https://ncstateuniversityitng.slack.com/files/U8QQDGG2C/F8X2Z0TG9/screen_shot_2018-01-23_at_9.53.11_pm.png (Screen Shot 2018-01-23 at 9.53.11 PM.png) 
2018-01-23 21:54:42	jesse	ahh maybe i was signed in as my ncsu account 
2018-01-23 21:54:59	jesse	i can edit now 
2018-01-23 21:55:50	Janne	yayyyy :smile: 
2018-01-23 21:56:23	jesse	so get this... im signed in as jesse.simpson and when I click a link, it says I'm jlsimps4... 
2018-01-23 21:56:29	Janne	can you note down which columns you remove if you remove any? 
2018-01-23 21:56:35	Janne	lol what link? 
2018-01-23 21:56:48	jesse	any spreadsheet... then I have to manually change the accounts 
2018-01-23 21:58:34	jesse	but yeah I can note down the columns I remove. Honestly, I'm thinkin about just modeling them all after the hospital one and making one ginormous table out of it. 
2018-01-23 21:59:02	Janne	That's what I wanted to do to, but there's seriously a lot more columns in some of the other tables 
2018-01-23 21:59:32	jesse	well we can keep them in separate tables then. 
2018-01-23 21:59:53	jesse	we don't even know how these are going to be used anyway :disappointed: 
2018-01-23 22:00:00	Janne	Sorry for reiterating this but I just want to make sure we aren't deleting any possible data that we don't know that meaning to 
2018-01-23 22:00:06	Janne	Exactly 
2018-01-23 22:00:35	Janne	it would be nice to have a better description that just "rare diseases" lol 
2018-01-23 22:00:40	Janne	it would help a lottt 
2018-01-23 22:01:33	jesse	yeah. We may get that after the meeting with the real people. 
2018-01-23 22:01:58	Janne	i can't go to that meeting :tired_face: 
2018-01-23 22:02:03	Janne	I have class during that time 
2018-01-23 22:02:45	jesse	shoot thats during PLM isn't it?! 
2018-01-23 22:03:54	Janne	yeahhh im pretty sure 
2018-01-23 22:04:08	jesse	Dang!! 
2018-01-23 22:04:20	Janne	I wish I could skip that class, but I cant risk it 
2018-01-23 22:05:42	jesse	it doesn't seem like a hard class, but since its team based, I don't wanna mess up my other team members. 
2018-01-23 22:09:41	jesse	ya know we could just keep all the columns as they are and just query for whatever we need. It's a little bit of a waste in memory tho 
2018-01-23 22:10:16	Janne	yeahh that's what we have to think about 
2018-01-23 22:12:19	jesse	If we keep all of the columns that we don't fully understand... then we are only able to remove columns that don't have a purpose (such as a column with the same value for every entry)... and there aren't many of those 
2018-01-23 22:15:07	jesse	website and ownership are both not available for every entry in nursing homes but in a way, it could be useful to know what information we would not be able to extract... but more than likely, its worthless data 
2018-01-23 22:20:17	jesse	As for the things we are unsure about; if we are unsure about what the data is, then I would imagine that kowolenko wouldn't understand either since he isn't a medical professional.. and then we wouldn't be able to use that data anyway. So we could go for the conservative approach or the trim everything approach. I think its best to keep everything until we know how hospitals and specialists will be used in the system. Its possible that most of this data is irrelevant anyway. [:+1::skin-tone-4:1] 
2018-01-23 22:23:50	jesse	Something more concerning is the fact that we don't yet have a way to match each specialist to a particular hospital... I'm looking at the specialist table now and those columns are mostly blank 
2018-01-30 20:07:42	jesse	Hey Janne, I found a table if ya wanted to join. Im on the 3rd floor. as you come up the stairs, just take a u turn on your left. 
2018-02-04 15:19:54	jesse	Hey Janne, do you have an idea of what you're gonna try to get done for raredx stuff this week? 
2018-02-04 15:20:35	Janne	As of right now I'm creating the attributes from tehrare dx companies to filter into yurika and my own crawler 
2018-02-04 15:20:56	Janne	Also that's what I'll mostly be using to create some sort of table of data 
2018-02-04 15:21:16	jesse	by raredx companies do you mean the list of pharmacies and whatever kowolenko sent us? 
2018-02-04 15:25:00	jesse	Also, I was considering asking meaghan if she could handle the AgensGraph/gephi stuff since Sagar won't be available... but I'm not too sure yet since I may have time to figure that out. 
2018-02-04 15:25:29	Janne	Yeah that's what I meant :slightly_smiling_face: 
2018-02-04 15:25:47	Janne	After I creating my basic tables I was also thinking of tackling that stuff 
2018-02-04 15:25:56	Janne	have you made any progress on that? 
2018-02-04 15:27:35	jesse	not really. I just installed the two programs... its a lil screwy cuz you have to uninstall postgresql for it to work... I think I'm going to try to extract the specialists relation to rare diseases from the pubmed website. and maybe i'll come back to that. 
2018-02-04 15:28:07	Janne	What I'm thinking is that we if we can find some way to have the gephi application work on our application we can import the data from our database as GEXF files. https://gephi.org/users/supported-graph-formats/ 
2018-02-04 15:31:10	Janne	Do you know who uploaded the list_of_rare_dx in our RareDiseases folder? 
2018-02-04 15:32:42	jesse	is that the one that starts with acquired hemophilia? 
2018-02-04 15:32:52	Janne	Yuppp 
2018-02-04 15:33:36	jesse	me. I took that from nords website with curl and used grep to filter the nonsense 
2018-02-04 15:43:33	Janne	Oh ohk. Dr. Kowolenko said that he created the rare diseases table using the data from NORD and GARD. 
2018-02-04 15:44:32	Janne	The disease_names_genes table contains around 30,000 specific diseases. If you want a more extensive list :slightly_smiling_face: 
2018-02-04 15:44:52	Janne	I'm thinking of just connecting to it in my python script to read it. 
2018-02-04 15:45:50	Janne	But in my opinion i think the table in the NCBI database is kinda organized funny. We haven't really be briefed about the whole structured so maybe if we had one we'll get a better understanding. 
2018-02-04 15:46:05	Janne	Thanks for uploading that list! 
2018-02-04 15:49:03	jesse	is that table what dr. kowolenko meant when he mentioned he made a list of the diseases? 
2018-02-04 15:50:06	Janne	There are several "disease" tables in the ncbi database but that one (disease_names...) is the only one I found where the "disease" column has actual disease values. 
2018-02-04 15:50:19	Janne	Other tabled like the pubmed db has a giant description of the database 
2018-02-04 15:51:05	jesse	qjk 
2018-02-04 15:51:13	jesse	didn't mean to send that lol 
2018-02-04 15:51:18	Janne	lololol 
2018-02-04 15:51:30	jesse	trying to do psql stuff in the terminal haha 
2018-02-04 16:13:57	jesse	the issue with the bigger lists of rare diseases is that I cant make yurika crawl 30,000 websites and the websites those queries link to... 
2018-02-04 16:14:46	Janne	true, but another argument is that you might miss some rare diseases 
2018-02-04 16:15:05	Janne	We can always section up the data we use in the crawler 
2018-02-04 16:15:16	Janne	Are you thinking of using your own crawler as well? 
2018-02-04 16:18:36	jesse	I'm using my instance of yurika right now. I might make my own script to specifically search for the authors of each article on pubmed. 
2018-02-04 16:20:45	jesse	its kinda complicated, trying to match up the rare disease to the specialist... and even when I get the information, I'll have no idea if that info is reliable since there are many people with the same name in the US. 
2018-02-04 16:22:51	jesse	maybe I can make a dictionary of the specialists and search on that dictionary with the queries of rare-dx's .... but that would be over 30,000 names 
2018-02-04 16:25:04	jesse	I feel really incompetent when it comes to this project  (-_-) 
2018-02-04 18:32:02	Janne	Me too :tired_face: 
2018-02-04 18:32:09	Janne	Are you running Yurika rn? 
2018-02-04 18:32:29	jesse	no 
2018-02-05 09:33:26	jesse	Let me know if you get around to trying to do the gephi/agensgraph stuff... i had a few dependency issues when I was trying to install and run it 
2018-02-05 12:23:25	Janne	Ohk :slightly_smiling_face: I probably wont be working on it until tomorrow. 
2018-02-05 12:23:33	Janne	Mainly working on Senior Design today 
2018-02-05 12:24:28	jesse	I gotcha. I probably won't do much of this today either. I'm getting kinda tired lol 
2018-02-05 15:10:39	Janne	Me too :disappointed: 
2018-02-05 15:10:47	Janne	But we can totally do this!! 
2018-02-05 21:19:49	jesse	@jesse uploaded a file: https://ncstateuniversityitng.slack.com/files/U8QQFV2GG/F94B5D9EE/sample_data_to_convert_to_csv.js (sample data to convert to csv) and commented: Hey Janne... I've got this big text file filled with rare disease info, and specialist name, but I'm kinda blanking on what the best way to process it. Could you take a look? each entry in the txt file looks like this... 
2018-02-05 21:23:50	jesse	I'd like to make a dataframe out of it all but theres multiple authors and multiple author locations which makes it confusing. 
2018-02-05 21:30:40	jesse	I think I got it. im just bein dumb. 
2018-02-06 08:18:41	Janne	I thought I ad sent this yesterday: "Yeah sure! I won't be working on this until tomorrow though :disappointed: I have a senior design tonight" 
2018-02-06 09:43:40	jesse	thats ok. i made a csv out of it. its ugly tho 
2018-02-07 19:25:40	Janne	Ohk I'm getting really frustrated at Sagar rn lol 
2018-02-07 19:31:56	jesse	whys that? im not lookin at the messages rn, im doin laundry 
2018-02-07 19:34:00	Janne	Lol it's all good. He's helping now but literally I was asking him for an example of one line of code and he gave me references to things I had that didn't have. But it's all good now lol I was getting frustrated for a little bit 
2018-02-07 19:36:29	jesse	gotcha. i tried understanding the question but I don't really understand the context. Glad it worked out. 
2018-02-11 09:13:30	jesse	Hey Janne, do you understand the PLM homework? 
2018-02-12 10:06:57	Janne	Hey! Sorry for the late response. No i dont really understand what's going on. 
2018-02-12 10:07:17	Janne	But i saw Alex Phelp's post 
2018-02-12 10:07:28	Janne	I think that'll help but I haven't read it yet 
2018-02-12 10:08:21	jesse	oh thats ok. i saw that too. i ended up just doing something that looks like it could be right and submitting it... i spent too much time trying to interpret it. 
2018-02-13 10:08:12	Janne	Rightt I'm on that problem now. 
2018-02-13 10:08:26	Janne	Do you think you have any time to meet before class starts? 
2018-02-13 10:09:10	jesse	about raredx stuff or the plm homework? 
2018-02-13 10:33:26	jesse	not that it changes my answer. I can meet up, but I wont be much use to you for the plm assignment 
2018-02-13 10:45:44	jesse	Just let me know if ya want to meet. I'm available all day except for plm class time. [:+1::skin-tone-4:1] 
2018-02-13 13:17:18	jesse	Hey Janne, how is crawling the drug companies going? and how is linking specialists with raredx from pubmed? 
2018-02-13 13:21:37	Janne	Can we meet after my senior design class? We get out around 2:40PM 
2018-02-13 13:21:44	jesse	Sure thing 
2018-02-13 14:44:34	jesse	I have a table on the 3rd floor behind the printers 
2018-02-15 13:10:10	jesse	Did you retain a lot of the last PLM lecture? All that stuff went completely over my head lol. 
2018-02-15 13:10:49	jesse	I'm looking over Menzies notes now 
2018-02-18 16:05:11	jesse	Hey Janne, I got to a point with the pubmed data where I gave the rest of the work to Arun and I'm free to do other things. How is the drug company stuff going? 
2018-02-18 17:14:30	jesse	Let me know if you want me to help. As for the pubmed data, I got the script to make a CSV. its about a gigabyte big and is mildly buggy so I let Arun handle it since there isn't a whole lot of work to do now that the CSV is populating. 
2018-02-19 08:32:00	Janne	Hey there! Would you be down to work on DrugCo later today? 
2018-02-19 09:23:08	jesse	I'll be free after 5pm. I've got some classes on main on Monday/Wednesday. 
2018-02-19 10:47:26	Janne	I can do after 5 on main :slightly_smiling_face: 
2018-02-19 10:48:36	jesse	ok. If it's on main, I'll be available as soon as 4:15 and will also be available 1 - 3 (but i usually use that time for homework.) 
2018-02-19 15:01:09	Janne	Would you want to work on Main or Hunt? 
2018-02-19 15:01:21	Janne	I can be there after 5. Better parking for both options :slightly_smiling_face: 
2018-02-19 15:42:20	jesse	I can be at either places. My preference would probably be hunt though 
2018-02-19 16:22:57	Janne	That's fine with me too! So I'm in durham and its about rush hour :expressionless: would it be cool if we meet closer to 6:-6:30 when the traffic has died. 
2018-02-19 16:35:52	jesse	Sounds good! I'm making dinner now so I was actually just about to text you that id be late 
2018-02-19 20:32:18	jesse	Hey Janne, I found a website you've probably already seen, but i'll share it anyway. https://clinicaltrials.gov for the clinical trials.  It wouldn't help with the other information we need though.
2018-02-19 20:32:18		Home - ClinicalTrials.gov 
2018-02-19 22:22:55	jesse	One of my group member completed his role of implementing crazy eight. so happy. pretty sure the solitaire guy hasnt started though. still though. its a nice feeling. Good luck with your group's meeting. 
2018-02-19 22:26:18	jesse	And my part of the project is almost done :slightly_smiling_face: 
2018-02-19 22:36:31	jesse	Oh, and Arun got back to me saying he can run stuff in yurika. I told him to contact you. Id be free to meet up again tomorrow after class or Wednesday night if you think i could be of assistance for anything drug company related... but i felt pretty worthless today haha. 
2018-02-19 22:36:31		If Arun's yurika thing doesn't work out, we should tell Meaghan we are struggling with the drug companies. 
2018-02-21 16:20:46	jesse	let me know if there's anything i can do to help with the pharma stuff. (if you're working on that.). i reached this strange point where all my homework is done and have nothing else to do but drink tea xD

2018-02-22 17:22:17		Derek Banas: Lisp Tutorial 
2018-02-23 07:47:39	jesse	hey Janne, id be free to meet today before 4:30 if ya wanna do raredx stuff.  
2018-02-23 07:56:37	jesse	though that may be difficult if you need to park somewhere 
2018-02-23 13:08:48	Janne	Hey Jesse! I actually can't meet today. I just realized I have a test for my other class that I haven't studied for. That's my main priority today :disappointed: 
2018-02-23 13:22:05	jesse	that's alright. ive been doing other stuff anyway.  btw I'm not sure if i would use that lisp video you sent. The lisp that menzies is having us learn is kinda different than regular lisp. 
2018-02-23 15:22:14	Janne	Awww ohk /: 
2018-02-23 15:22:20	Janne	Yeah I haven't watched that video yet 
2018-02-23 15:22:29	Janne	Guess I need to just read the pdf he has on the site 
2018-02-23 15:41:16	jesse	i watched the first half of the video. it's pretty good and helped me get used to some of the look and feel for lisp as well as a few added functions that are nice to know.
2018-02-23 15:41:16		that pdf is what test questions will come from though... and that syntax is kinda different... some of it isn't even valid lisp such as the "label" function. 
2018-02-28 19:07:57	Janne	Hey there! Would you happen to know where the LISP pdf is? 
2018-02-28 19:25:52	jesse	i think i can find it. 
2018-02-28 19:28:10	jesse	@jesse uploaded a file: https://ncstateuniversityitng.slack.com/files/U8QQFV2GG/F9GGEV0D9/jmc.ps (jmc.ps)

2018-03-19 22:26:30	jesse	I'm not sure my task for the week is gonna be very fruitful.. so if ya need help with anything regarding the drug company data, just let me know. 
2018-04-01 10:53:10	jesse	Hey Janne, does any of the information you're gathering relate to the social groups for each raredx? And would I find that info on some of the websites you are searching through? 
2018-04-02 15:08:46	Janne	I have seen that some companies do have social groups 
2018-04-02 15:09:05	Janne	http://www.abbviepaf.org/ 
2018-04-02 15:09:23	Janne	I'm not able to get that information from the 10K file though 
2018-04-02 17:10:02	jesse	Thanks for letting me know 
2018-04-08 11:07:52	jesse	I found a better progress bar. check out the progressbar2 pip package. it gives an estimated time, an index/total, percentage and progress bar  
2018-04-08 16:59:46	Janne	Lol that's pretty awesome! 
2018-04-12 10:15:20	Janne	https://www.mds-foundation.org/global-patient-support-groups/#US-MDS-Support-Groups 
2018-04-17 16:56:57	Janne	when is the final for this class 
2018-04-17 17:59:09	jesse	I emailed Dr. Adams about that regulation I showed you for PLM. I didn't wanna talk to menzies. 
2018-04-17 18:11:34	jesse	btw, what do you always talk to menzies about at the end of class? I can't imagine interacting as much as you do with a professor. 
2018-04-19 09:53:42		getting channel history...
2018-01-23 11:08:00	Janne	I gave her my ssh key but I think something is messed up in my set 
2018-01-23 11:08:06	Janne	I can't log into both 
2018-01-23 11:08:25	jesse	...did you give her your public key or private? 
2018-01-23 11:09:18	Janne	public 
2018-01-23 11:10:08	jesse	you should probably talk to meaghan then. 
2018-01-23 11:10:23	Janne	Oh i know what's happening, when I try to ssh my key that was used can't be found 
2018-01-23 11:10:40	jesse	is it not in the .ssh directory? 
2018-01-23 11:10:47	Janne	it is 
2018-01-23 11:11:05	Janne	but it the output logs when I ssh it doesn't know to search that key? 
2018-01-23 11:11:58	Janne	I'm in!!! :smile: 
2018-01-23 11:12:27	jesse	yeayy! 
2018-01-23 11:13:03	Janne	lol I'm sorry I bothered you 
2018-01-23 11:13:27	jesse	youre good. 
2018-01-23 14:32:27	jesse	Hey Janne, what are you currently working on as far as rare diseases? 
2018-01-23 15:01:46	Janne	I've been slacking on the organs but I'll get that done soon. I was also planning on starting to look at some of the websites we have to crawl, but I was hoping we could section out which websites each member was going to crawl before working on it. 
2018-01-23 15:09:30	jesse	I've been slacking  on this since Friday or something.  i was gonna start crawling  some time since yurika seems pretty simple. would you maybe wanna work on this some after plm? 
2018-01-23 15:26:16	Janne	Yeah sure! 
2018-01-23 15:26:39	jesse	cool! 
2018-01-23 17:49:09	jesse	wanna meet at the library? 
2018-01-23 18:06:41	jesse	Just noticed that there are some urls added with Yurika. I'm guessing you did that? I kinda expected that this would be running locally rather than one shared session between us. Since this is the case, do you think that we should run all of the links at once? 
2018-01-23 18:09:11	jesse	I'm also wondering if the output will be downloaded onto our system or if it will be saved onto their server/db. the latter may be problematic 
2018-01-23 18:13:45	Janne	I did not add them lol but I noticed that as well 
2018-01-23 18:13:59	jesse	it may have been me lol 
2018-01-23 18:14:24	Janne	lol how did that happen? were you able to use Yurika already? (outside of the web version) 
2018-01-23 18:14:53	jesse	pretty sure the web version is the only version 
2018-01-23 18:24:00	Janne	oh lol ohk :sweat_smile: 
2018-01-23 18:25:13	jesse	this things weird. 
2018-01-23 18:29:16	jesse	it seems like you have to know exactly what you want before you start scraping... usually, I would think you would want to get everything downloaded first and then start filtering. 
2018-01-23 18:31:08	jesse	ok so I put a blank mindmap and a query for 'pregnancy'. shall I run the thing and see what happens? 
2018-01-23 18:34:46	jesse	ok so nothing happened... not really surprised lol... is there something we could be doing that doesn't involve yurika? I'm thinkin we should just leave this for after thursdays meeting when they are gonna teach us the thing. [:+1::skin-tone-4:1] 
2018-01-23 18:48:27	jesse	should I go and make the databases? or does more stuff need to be done with the CSV's ? 
2018-01-23 21:41:34	Janne	Oh yeah we do have access to the database? 
2018-01-23 21:41:45	Janne	Oh where can we access the db btw? 
2018-01-23 21:42:00	Janne	Ummm idk if we should just yet 
2018-01-23 21:42:25	jesse	which one? 
2018-01-23 21:43:56	jesse	we have to make the databases for the hospitals and specialists. We have access to a few others but they don't have much important information for our part of the project 
2018-01-23 21:44:24	Janne	i guess the ones currently available 
2018-01-23 21:44:57	Janne	i know we do but i'm not sure if we have the schemas for all the tables yet (hospital and or specialists), or do we? 
2018-01-23 21:46:04	jesse	We don't have a set schema, it would just be whatever is on the csv's. 
2018-01-23 21:46:46	Janne	i figured, we haven't cleaned the other medical facilities yet right? 
2018-01-23 21:47:15	jesse	correct. 
2018-01-23 21:48:44	jesse	I didn't have permission to modify the google sheets so I couldn't do that. 
2018-01-23 21:49:56	Janne	oh ohk that's weird, I can try to give you access? 
2018-01-23 21:50:03	Janne	idk why that keeps happening 
2018-01-23 21:51:42	jesse	I'm not sure. I'll see if theres a way to fix it. 
2018-01-23 21:52:18	Janne	oh wait, did you say you're not using your ncsu acct? 
2018-01-23 21:52:33	jesse	i made the folder... that shouldnt matter 
2018-01-23 21:52:49	Janne	oh you right 
2018-01-23 21:53:18	Janne	which ones can't you acces? 
2018-01-23 21:53:21	Janne	access* 
2018-01-23 21:53:41	Janne	@Janne uploaded a file: https://ncstateuniversityitng.slack.com/files/U8QQDGG2C/F8X2Z0TG9/screen_shot_2018-01-23_at_9.53.11_pm.png (Screen Shot 2018-01-23 at 9.53.11 PM.png) 
2018-01-23 21:54:42	jesse	ahh maybe i was signed in as my ncsu account 
2018-01-23 21:54:59	jesse	i can edit now 
2018-01-23 21:55:50	Janne	yayyyy :smile: 
2018-01-23 21:56:23	jesse	so get this... im signed in as jesse.simpson and when I click a link, it says I'm jlsimps4... 
2018-01-23 21:56:29	Janne	can you note down which columns you remove if you remove any? 
2018-01-23 21:56:35	Janne	lol what link? 
2018-01-23 21:56:48	jesse	any spreadsheet... then I have to manually change the accounts 
2018-01-23 21:58:34	jesse	but yeah I can note down the columns I remove. Honestly, I'm thinkin about just modeling them all after the hospital one and making one ginormous table out of it. 
2018-01-23 21:59:02	Janne	That's what I wanted to do to, but there's seriously a lot more columns in some of the other tables 
2018-01-23 21:59:32	jesse	well we can keep them in separate tables then. 
2018-01-23 21:59:53	jesse	we don't even know how these are going to be used anyway :disappointed: 
2018-01-23 22:00:00	Janne	Sorry for reiterating this but I just want to make sure we aren't deleting any possible data that we don't know that meaning to 
2018-01-23 22:00:06	Janne	Exactly 
2018-01-23 22:00:35	Janne	it would be nice to have a better description that just "rare diseases" lol 
2018-01-23 22:00:40	Janne	it would help a lottt 
2018-01-23 22:01:33	jesse	yeah. We may get that after the meeting with the real people. 
2018-01-23 22:01:58	Janne	i can't go to that meeting :tired_face: 
2018-01-23 22:02:03	Janne	I have class during that time 
2018-01-23 22:02:45	jesse	shoot thats during PLM isn't it?! 
2018-01-23 22:03:54	Janne	yeahhh im pretty sure 
2018-01-23 22:04:08	jesse	Dang!! 
2018-01-23 22:04:20	Janne	I wish I could skip that class, but I cant risk it 
2018-01-23 22:05:42	jesse	it doesn't seem like a hard class, but since its team based, I don't wanna mess up my other team members. 
2018-01-23 22:09:41	jesse	ya know we could just keep all the columns as they are and just query for whatever we need. It's a little bit of a waste in memory tho 
2018-01-23 22:10:16	Janne	yeahh that's what we have to think about 
2018-01-23 22:12:19	jesse	If we keep all of the columns that we don't fully understand... then we are only able to remove columns that don't have a purpose (such as a column with the same value for every entry)... and there aren't many of those 
2018-01-23 22:15:07	jesse	website and ownership are both not available for every entry in nursing homes but in a way, it could be useful to know what information we would not be able to extract... but more than likely, its worthless data 
2018-01-23 22:20:17	jesse	As for the things we are unsure about; if we are unsure about what the data is, then I would imagine that kowolenko wouldn't understand either since he isn't a medical professional.. and then we wouldn't be able to use that data anyway. So we could go for the conservative approach or the trim everything approach. I think its best to keep everything until we know how hospitals and specialists will be used in the system. Its possible that most of this data is irrelevant anyway. [:+1::skin-tone-4:1] 
2018-01-23 22:23:50	jesse	Something more concerning is the fact that we don't yet have a way to match each specialist to a particular hospital... I'm looking at the specialist table now and those columns are mostly blank 
2018-01-30 20:07:42	jesse	Hey Janne, I found a table if ya wanted to join. Im on the 3rd floor. as you come up the stairs, just take a u turn on your left. 
2018-02-04 15:19:54	jesse	Hey Janne, do you have an idea of what you're gonna try to get done for raredx stuff this week? 
2018-02-04 15:20:35	Janne	As of right now I'm creating the attributes from tehrare dx companies to filter into yurika and my own crawler 
2018-02-04 15:20:56	Janne	Also that's what I'll mostly be using to create some sort of table of data 
2018-02-04 15:21:16	jesse	by raredx companies do you mean the list of pharmacies and whatever kowolenko sent us? 
2018-02-04 15:25:00	jesse	Also, I was considering asking meaghan if she could handle the AgensGraph/gephi stuff since Sagar won't be available... but I'm not too sure yet since I may have time to figure that out. 
2018-02-04 15:25:29	Janne	Yeah that's what I meant :slightly_smiling_face: 
2018-02-04 15:25:47	Janne	After I creating my basic tables I was also thinking of tackling that stuff 
2018-02-04 15:25:56	Janne	have you made any progress on that? 
2018-02-04 15:27:35	jesse	not really. I just installed the two programs... its a lil screwy cuz you have to uninstall postgresql for it to work... I think I'm going to try to extract the specialists relation to rare diseases from the pubmed website. and maybe i'll come back to that. 
2018-02-04 15:28:07	Janne	What I'm thinking is that we if we can find some way to have the gephi application work on our application we can import the data from our database as GEXF files. https://gephi.org/users/supported-graph-formats/ 
2018-02-04 15:31:10	Janne	Do you know who uploaded the list_of_rare_dx in our RareDiseases folder? 
2018-02-04 15:32:42	jesse	is that the one that starts with acquired hemophilia? 
2018-02-04 15:32:52	Janne	Yuppp 
2018-02-04 15:33:36	jesse	me. I took that from nords website with curl and used grep to filter the nonsense 
2018-02-04 15:43:33	Janne	Oh ohk. Dr. Kowolenko said that he created the rare diseases table using the data from NORD and GARD. 
2018-02-04 15:44:32	Janne	The disease_names_genes table contains around 30,000 specific diseases. If you want a more extensive list :slightly_smiling_face: 
2018-02-04 15:44:52	Janne	I'm thinking of just connecting to it in my python script to read it. 
2018-02-04 15:45:50	Janne	But in my opinion i think the table in the NCBI database is kinda organized funny. We haven't really be briefed about the whole structured so maybe if we had one we'll get a better understanding. 
2018-02-04 15:46:05	Janne	Thanks for uploading that list! 
2018-02-04 15:49:03	jesse	is that table what dr. kowolenko meant when he mentioned he made a list of the diseases? 
2018-02-04 15:50:06	Janne	There are several "disease" tables in the ncbi database but that one (disease_names...) is the only one I found where the "disease" column has actual disease values. 
2018-02-04 15:50:19	Janne	Other tabled like the pubmed db has a giant description of the database 
2018-02-04 15:51:05	jesse	qjk 
2018-02-04 15:51:13	jesse	didn't mean to send that lol 
2018-02-04 15:51:18	Janne	lololol 
2018-02-04 15:51:30	jesse	trying to do psql stuff in the terminal haha 
2018-02-04 16:13:57	jesse	the issue with the bigger lists of rare diseases is that I cant make yurika crawl 30,000 websites and the websites those queries link to... 
2018-02-04 16:14:46	Janne	true, but another argument is that you might miss some rare diseases 
2018-02-04 16:15:05	Janne	We can always section up the data we use in the crawler 
2018-02-04 16:15:16	Janne	Are you thinking of using your own crawler as well? 
2018-02-04 16:18:36	jesse	I'm using my instance of yurika right now. I might make my own script to specifically search for the authors of each article on pubmed. 
2018-02-04 16:20:45	jesse	its kinda complicated, trying to match up the rare disease to the specialist... and even when I get the information, I'll have no idea if that info is reliable since there are many people with the same name in the US. 
2018-02-04 16:22:51	jesse	maybe I can make a dictionary of the specialists and search on that dictionary with the queries of rare-dx's .... but that would be over 30,000 names 
2018-02-04 16:25:04	jesse	I feel really incompetent when it comes to this project  (-_-) 
2018-02-04 18:32:02	Janne	Me too :tired_face: 
2018-02-04 18:32:09	Janne	Are you running Yurika rn? 
2018-02-04 18:32:29	jesse	no 
2018-02-05 09:33:26	jesse	Let me know if you get around to trying to do the gephi/agensgraph stuff... i had a few dependency issues when I was trying to install and run it 
2018-02-05 12:23:25	Janne	Ohk :slightly_smiling_face: I probably wont be working on it until tomorrow. 
2018-02-05 12:23:33	Janne	Mainly working on Senior Design today 
2018-02-05 12:24:28	jesse	I gotcha. I probably won't do much of this today either. I'm getting kinda tired lol 
2018-02-05 15:10:39	Janne	Me too :disappointed: 
2018-02-05 15:10:47	Janne	But we can totally do this!! 
2018-02-05 21:19:49	jesse	@jesse uploaded a file: https://ncstateuniversityitng.slack.com/files/U8QQFV2GG/F94B5D9EE/sample_data_to_convert_to_csv.js (sample data to convert to csv) and commented: Hey Janne... I've got this big text file filled with rare disease info, and specialist name, but I'm kinda blanking on what the best way to process it. Could you take a look? each entry in the txt file looks like this... 
2018-02-05 21:23:50	jesse	I'd like to make a dataframe out of it all but theres multiple authors and multiple author locations which makes it confusing. 
2018-02-05 21:30:40	jesse	I think I got it. im just bein dumb. 
2018-02-06 08:18:41	Janne	I thought I ad sent this yesterday: "Yeah sure! I won't be working on this until tomorrow though :disappointed: I have a senior design tonight" 
2018-02-06 09:43:40	jesse	thats ok. i made a csv out of it. its ugly tho 
2018-02-07 19:25:40	Janne	Ohk I'm getting really frustrated at Sagar rn lol 
2018-02-07 19:31:56	jesse	whys that? im not lookin at the messages rn, im doin laundry 
2018-02-07 19:34:00	Janne	Lol it's all good. He's helping now but literally I was asking him for an example of one line of code and he gave me references to things I had that didn't have. But it's all good now lol I was getting frustrated for a little bit 
2018-02-07 19:36:29	jesse	gotcha. i tried understanding the question but I don't really understand the context. Glad it worked out. 
2018-02-11 09:13:30	jesse	Hey Janne, do you understand the PLM homework? 
2018-02-12 10:06:57	Janne	Hey! Sorry for the late response. No i dont really understand what's going on. 
2018-02-12 10:07:17	Janne	But i saw Alex Phelp's post 
2018-02-12 10:07:28	Janne	I think that'll help but I haven't read it yet 
2018-02-12 10:08:21	jesse	oh thats ok. i saw that too. i ended up just doing something that looks like it could be right and submitting it... i spent too much time trying to interpret it. 
2018-02-13 10:08:12	Janne	Rightt I'm on that problem now. 
2018-02-13 10:08:26	Janne	Do you think you have any time to meet before class starts? 
2018-02-13 10:09:10	jesse	about raredx stuff or the plm homework? 
2018-02-13 10:33:26	jesse	not that it changes my answer. I can meet up, but I wont be much use to you for the plm assignment 
2018-02-13 10:45:44	jesse	Just let me know if ya want to meet. I'm available all day except for plm class time. [:+1::skin-tone-4:1] 
2018-02-13 13:17:18	jesse	Hey Janne, how is crawling the drug companies going? and how is linking specialists with raredx from pubmed? 
2018-02-13 13:21:37	Janne	Can we meet after my senior design class? We get out around 2:40PM 
2018-02-13 13:21:44	jesse	Sure thing 
2018-02-13 14:44:34	jesse	I have a table on the 3rd floor behind the printers 
2018-02-15 13:10:10	jesse	Did you retain a lot of the last PLM lecture? All that stuff went completely over my head lol. 
2018-02-15 13:10:49	jesse	I'm looking over Menzies notes now 
2018-02-18 16:05:11	jesse	Hey Janne, I got to a point with the pubmed data where I gave the rest of the work to Arun and I'm free to do other things. How is the drug company stuff going? 
2018-02-18 17:14:30	jesse	Let me know if you want me to help. As for the pubmed data, I got the script to make a CSV. its about a gigabyte big and is mildly buggy so I let Arun handle it since there isn't a whole lot of work to do now that the CSV is populating. 
2018-02-19 08:32:00	Janne	Hey there! Would you be down to work on DrugCo later today? 
2018-02-19 09:23:08	jesse	I'll be free after 5pm. I've got some classes on main on Monday/Wednesday. 
2018-02-19 10:47:26	Janne	I can do after 5 on main :slightly_smiling_face: 
2018-02-19 10:48:36	jesse	ok. If it's on main, I'll be available as soon as 4:15 and will also be available 1 - 3 (but i usually use that time for homework.) 
2018-02-19 15:01:09	Janne	Would you want to work on Main or Hunt? 
2018-02-19 15:01:21	Janne	I can be there after 5. Better parking for both options :slightly_smiling_face: 
2018-02-19 15:42:20	jesse	I can be at either places. My preference would probably be hunt though 
2018-02-19 16:22:57	Janne	That's fine with me too! So I'm in durham and its about rush hour :expressionless: would it be cool if we meet closer to 6:-6:30 when the traffic has died. 
2018-02-19 16:35:52	jesse	Sounds good! I'm making dinner now so I was actually just about to text you that id be late 
2018-02-19 20:32:18	jesse	Hey Janne, I found a website you've probably already seen, but i'll share it anyway. https://clinicaltrials.gov for the clinical trials.  It wouldn't help with the other information we need though.
2018-02-19 20:32:18		Home - ClinicalTrials.gov 
2018-02-19 22:22:55	jesse	One of my group member completed his role of implementing crazy eight. so happy. pretty sure the solitaire guy hasnt started though. still though. its a nice feeling. Good luck with your group's meeting. 
2018-02-19 22:26:18	jesse	And my part of the project is almost done :slightly_smiling_face: 
2018-02-19 22:36:31	jesse	Oh, and Arun got back to me saying he can run stuff in yurika. I told him to contact you. Id be free to meet up again tomorrow after class or Wednesday night if you think i could be of assistance for anything drug company related... but i felt pretty worthless today haha. 
2018-02-19 22:36:31		If Arun's yurika thing doesn't work out, we should tell Meaghan we are struggling with the drug companies. 
2018-02-21 16:20:46	jesse	let me know if there's anything i can do to help with the pharma stuff. (if you're working on that.). i reached this strange point where all my homework is done and have nothing else to do but drink tea xD

2018-02-22 17:22:17		Derek Banas: Lisp Tutorial 
2018-02-23 07:47:39	jesse	hey Janne, id be free to meet today before 4:30 if ya wanna do raredx stuff.  
2018-02-23 07:56:37	jesse	though that may be difficult if you need to park somewhere 
2018-02-23 13:08:48	Janne	Hey Jesse! I actually can't meet today. I just realized I have a test for my other class that I haven't studied for. That's my main priority today :disappointed: 
2018-02-23 13:22:05	jesse	that's alright. ive been doing other stuff anyway.  btw I'm not sure if i would use that lisp video you sent. The lisp that menzies is having us learn is kinda different than regular lisp. 
2018-02-23 15:22:14	Janne	Awww ohk /: 
2018-02-23 15:22:20	Janne	Yeah I haven't watched that video yet 
2018-02-23 15:22:29	Janne	Guess I need to just read the pdf he has on the site 
2018-02-23 15:41:16	jesse	i watched the first half of the video. it's pretty good and helped me get used to some of the look and feel for lisp as well as a few added functions that are nice to know.
2018-02-23 15:41:16		that pdf is what test questions will come from though... and that syntax is kinda different... some of it isn't even valid lisp such as the "label" function. 
2018-02-28 19:07:57	Janne	Hey there! Would you happen to know where the LISP pdf is? 
2018-02-28 19:25:52	jesse	i think i can find it. 
2018-02-28 19:28:10	jesse	@jesse uploaded a file: https://ncstateuniversityitng.slack.com/files/U8QQFV2GG/F9GGEV0D9/jmc.ps (jmc.ps)

2018-03-19 22:26:30	jesse	I'm not sure my task for the week is gonna be very fruitful.. so if ya need help with anything regarding the drug company data, just let me know. 
2018-04-01 10:53:10	jesse	Hey Janne, does any of the information you're gathering relate to the social groups for each raredx? And would I find that info on some of the websites you are searching through? 
2018-04-02 15:08:46	Janne	I have seen that some companies do have social groups 
2018-04-02 15:09:05	Janne	http://www.abbviepaf.org/ 
2018-04-02 15:09:23	Janne	I'm not able to get that information from the 10K file though 
2018-04-02 17:10:02	jesse	Thanks for letting me know 
2018-04-08 11:07:52	jesse	I found a better progress bar. check out the progressbar2 pip package. it gives an estimated time, an index/total, percentage and progress bar  
2018-04-08 16:59:46	Janne	Lol that's pretty awesome!

2018-04-17 16:56:57	Janne	when is the final for this class 
2018-04-17 17:59:09	jesse	I emailed Dr. Adams about that regulation I showed you for PLM. I didn't wanna talk to menzies. 
2018-04-17 18:11:34	jesse	btw, what do you always talk to menzies about at the end of class? I can't imagine interacting as much as you do with a professor. 
2018-04-18 08:38:31	Janne	Oh I mentioned that regulation to him lol 
2018-04-18 08:39:03	jesse	did he dismiss it as rubbish? 
2018-04-18 08:39:18	Janne	I was going to ask him about AI stuff lol 
2018-04-18 08:39:34	jesse	aww. sorry i took ya from that 
2018-04-18 08:39:58	Janne	Lol i still talked to him about that 
2018-04-18 08:40:24	Janne	But he didn't he's working with Patrick on setting a correct date 
2018-04-18 08:41:30	jesse	but there cant be a correct date, unless its due this week. 
2018-04-18 08:43:25	Janne	yeah that's what he was also saying 
2018-04-18 08:45:47	jesse	well, thanks for talking with him about it. I'll let you know if dr adams emails me back but more than likely, nothing will happen. 
2018-04-18 08:46:12	Janne	Yeah, it's pretty late for something to hapen

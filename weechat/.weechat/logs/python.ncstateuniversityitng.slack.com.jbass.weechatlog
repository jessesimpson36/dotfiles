2018-04-19 14:28:23	jesse	hey John, I've looked at my calendar, and I'm free during May and Id be happy to keep helping with rare stuff. I'll be in Charlotte after may 8th  and i might be in Charlotte the week up until may 4th, but I can slack message you guys. I hope that me not coming to the meetings doesn't mess up you guys' work flow. 
2018-04-19 14:28:23		ps.   when we were talking earlier, I had thought I was forgetting something important that was happening during that time, but Im not. It was just a sticky note telling me to be sure I read up on mongodb/ .net more. lol 
2018-04-19 14:30:09	jesse	In June, Ill be back in Raleigh, but I wont be able to clock in any hours since schwab has a rule against doing multiple jobs.

2018-01-17 14:07:21	jesse	Hey Dr. Kowolenko, I saw an email saying that all non-mandatory employees were not allowed to report in for work today... I wanted to ask you if this includes us, who don't need to be physically present to do stuff. 
2018-01-17 14:07:48	mdkowole	no, don't come in - you can work from home on this. 
2018-01-17 14:07:59	jesse	So we can still clock hours? 
2018-01-17 14:08:06	mdkowole	yup 
2018-01-17 14:08:09	jesse	Yeayy! 
2018-01-17 14:08:16	jesse	I'll let the others know 
2018-01-18 09:00:56	mdkowole	meeting today by hangout 
2018-01-18 09:01:17	jesse	sweet! 
2018-01-26 11:07:57	jesse	Hey Dr. Kowolenko, I just saw an email about your Data Driven Decision Making homework assignment. Since I got this message and I'm not in your class anymore, I worry that some of your students for this semester may not have gotten it. 
2018-01-26 11:33:10	mdkowole	thanks Jesse - Yeah, I realized I sent it to the wrong group - 
2018-01-27 15:59:44	jesse	Hey Dr. Kowolenko, I'm working on the Django frontend for the databases for the specialists and hospitals and that's all going well. However, for me to continue, I need to be able to create and modify databases on http://power6a.oscar.ncsu.edu (power6a.oscar.ncsu.edu). Would you be able to grant me this power? (I asked Meaghan this as well, but shes offline). 
2018-01-27 16:00:25	mdkowole	give me a couple of minutes 
2018-01-27 16:00:41	jesse	:slightly_smiling_face: 
2018-01-27 16:04:34	mdkowole	which databases do you want access to? 
2018-01-27 16:05:09	jesse	Well I'd like to make one for the hospitals and the specialists. 
2018-01-27 16:08:01	mdkowole	try now 
2018-01-27 16:09:23	jesse	createdb works (^.^) 
2018-01-27 16:10:04	mdkowole	she gave you permission to add tables to the ncbi database (not really what I wanted).  I just gave you superuser priv.  I wanted a separate db - just what you?re doing. 
2018-01-27 16:10:39	jesse	Sweet thanks!! I will not abuse your gift. 
2018-01-27 16:11:17	mdkowole	:beers::+1: 
2018-02-12 19:35:08	jesse	Hey Dr. Kowolenko, I noticed in the specialists table, there are some entries for pharmacies. Do you want me to remove these entries? or maybe move them into their own table? 
2018-02-12 19:35:47	jesse	Under one of the columns, it clearly labels them as "Pharmacy" so it would be very easy for me to move or remove them. 
2018-02-13 09:29:04	mdkowole	Move them  
2018-02-13 09:29:27	jesse	Will do 
2018-03-05 10:03:01	jesse	Dr. Kowolenko, have you had issues with importing data into a dataframe where some of the data comes back as None or nan but it wasnt none or nan in the data that it was imported from? 
2018-03-05 10:08:20	mdkowole	No, haven?t seen that  
2018-03-05 10:11:12	jesse	alright. I appreciate it anyway. I'll find a way around it. 
2018-03-19 09:40:20	jesse	Hey Dr. Kowolenko,
2018-03-19 09:40:20		I was reading through the state by state chart you sent me, but it does not include the benefits that people who have a disability might receive. There were a few other documents on the Social Security Administrations website that I looked into, but they ended up just referring to a link to apply for benefits rather than actually listing it out for us to see.
2018-03-19 09:40:20		Is there some other way you know of to get this kind of data? For now, I can just put in some placeholder. 
2018-03-19 16:12:28	mdkowole	The idea would be to link to their benefits site.  
2018-03-19 17:03:48	jesse	I've checked a few different web pages for state's benefits sites and it doesn't give much information other than a link to SSA's site on applying for disability benefits. I haven't found any resource that listed the benefits that a person with disability may receive, which I had thought was the purpose of this feature. Are you sure this information is out there? 
2018-03-20 13:11:11	jesse	I wrote the program to search through the symptoms and check for words that would correspond to what that state pdf document would consider a disability. Just some common things like walking, speaking, seeing, hearing, etc for now. I also used the SSA's website as a placeholder for the disability page, since most of the states are just linking to that one.

2018-04-05 18:05:13	jesse	Hey Dr. Kowolenko, you sent an email with the title "order of presentations" to the Fall 2017 DDDM class again.  :P   Be sure the Spring guys get that message too. 
2018-04-05 18:18:11	mdkowole	Damn. Did it again!

2018-02-25 16:38:57	AlexPhelps	Odd question, but do we need a laptop for the exam?  I'm afraid my screen just went out and I doubt I'll have time to acquire a replacement before the test.

2018-02-27 13:45:03	ejgillia	so when you select 4 at random, is the mandatory one always going to be included? 
2018-02-27 17:45:47	timm	3. one mandatory and 3 others 
2018-02-27 17:46:11	camara	Is review #7 stuff fair game for the exam on Thursday? 
2018-03-01 11:48:56	AlexPhelps	On Question 13 of Review 6, is the carat denoting an AND?  Or is that a "to the power of"?  If A, B, C, D were 1, 2, 3, 4 respectively, what would the answer here be? 
2018-03-01 13:30:13	patrick_xia	It means "to the power of", so 1 * 2 ^ 3 + 4 = 12 
2018-03-01 13:58:31	AlexPhelps	Ok cool, thanks.

2018-01-09 17:35:15		Computers are now essential in all branches of science, but most researchers are never taught the equivalent of basic lab skills for research computing. As a result, data can get lost, analyses can take much longer than necessary, and researchers are ... 
2018-01-10 15:48:05	SamuelHenderson	Just for confirmation, we are supposed to use Python 3.0 for this course? Does the version matter? 
2018-01-10 15:49:48	patrick_xia	Yes, we will use Python 3, for the actual version, I suggest to use 3.6+ for the new features 
2018-01-11 12:06:48	cmthomp7	Are there outlets for each row in the class?  
2018-01-11 14:06:18	patrick_xia	Not sure, but some of them are not working though 
2018-01-11 14:31:45	asuh	Should we download Anaconda for python 3.6? 
2018-01-11 15:23:35	patrick_xia	Yes anaconda is a good option but not mandatory 
2018-01-11 17:04:33	adbishel	Is anyone else from group C here?

2018-01-12 11:58:14	riestell	Use a list comprehension to square each odd number in a list. The list is input by a sequence of comma-separated numbers.
2018-01-12 11:58:14		Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:
2018-01-12 11:58:14		1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9
2018-01-12 11:58:14		Then, the output should be:
2018-01-12 11:58:14		1,3,5,7,9 
2018-01-12 11:58:49	riestell	I am confused by question sixteen it says to square the odd numbers but the example shows odd numbers that are not squared 
2018-01-12 15:45:11	timm	Hey @riestell:  you are right. the output would should be [1,9,15,42,81]. 
2018-01-12 15:45:11		but no worries. when we look at everyone's work we will be looking more at  "can you bang the rocks together"

2018-01-14 17:38:53	schan3	And should the output type be list? or just string. i.e. [1, 9, 25, 49, 81] or 1, 9, 25, 49, 81 
2018-01-14 18:00:21	patrick_xia	You can do either way  
2018-01-15 14:58:15	cmthomp7	should we strictly time the exercises to be completed in 90 minutes? Is it okay if not all of them are completed then 
2018-01-15 15:02:39	patrick_xia	Yes, please try to finish the entire problem set in 90 minutes, but it's OK if you can't complete all of them, this is a exercise for programming skill evaluation.

2018-01-09 17:35:15		Good enough practices in scientific computing
2018-01-09 17:35:15		Computers are now essential in all branches of science, but most researchers are never taught the equivalent of basic lab skills for research computing. As a result, data can get lost, analyses can take much longer than necessary, and researchers are ... 
2018-01-10 15:48:05	SamuelHenderson	Just for confirmation, we are supposed to use Python 3.0 for this course? Does the version matter? 
2018-01-10 15:49:48	patrick_xia	Yes, we will use Python 3, for the actual version, I suggest to use 3.6+ for the new features 
2018-01-11 12:06:48	cmthomp7	Are there outlets for each row in the class?  
2018-01-11 14:06:18	patrick_xia	Not sure, but some of them are not working though 
2018-01-11 14:31:45	asuh	Should we download Anaconda for python 3.6? 
2018-01-11 15:23:35	patrick_xia	Yes anaconda is a good option but not mandatory 
2018-01-11 17:04:33	adbishel	Is anyone else from group C here? 
2018-01-11 17:05:31	AlexPhelps	Anaconda is great and lets you switch between Python 2 and Python 3 easily! 
2018-01-11 19:24:25	Dan.Grochmal	Will there be a link on Moodle to the Python problems? Or is it posted somewhere else? Thanks. [:+1:1] 
2018-01-11 19:32:45	patrick_xia	I think professor will post them soon

2018-01-12 11:58:14	riestell	Use a list comprehension to square each odd number in a list. The list is input by a sequence of comma-separated numbers.
2018-01-12 11:58:14		Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:
2018-01-12 11:58:14		1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9
2018-01-12 11:58:14		Then, the output should be:
2018-01-12 11:58:14		1,3,5,7,9 
2018-01-12 11:58:49	riestell	I am confused by question sixteen it says to square the odd numbers but the example shows odd numbers that are not squared 
2018-01-12 15:45:11	timm	Hey @riestell:  you are right. the output would should be [1,9,15,42,81]. 
2018-01-12 15:45:11		but no worries. when we look at everyone's work we will be looking more at  "can you bang the rocks together" 
2018-01-14 17:37:48	schan3	[1,9, 25, 49, 81] ? 
2018-01-14 17:38:46	jkayani	^ yeah I think that's what he meant 
2018-01-14 17:38:53	schan3	And should the output type be list? or just string. i.e. [1, 9, 25, 49, 81] or 1, 9, 25, 49, 81 
2018-01-14 18:00:21	patrick_xia	You can do either way  
2018-01-15 14:58:15	cmthomp7	should we strictly time the exercises to be completed in 90 minutes? Is it okay if not all of them are completed then 
2018-01-15 15:02:39	patrick_xia	Yes, please try to finish the entire problem set in 90 minutes, but it's OK if you can't complete all of them, this is a exercise for programming skill evaluation.

2018-01-10 15:48:05	SamuelHenderson	Just for confirmation, we are supposed to use Python 3.0 for this course? Does the version matter? 
2018-01-10 15:49:48	patrick_xia	Yes, we will use Python 3, for the actual version, I suggest to use 3.6+ for the new features 
2018-01-11 12:06:48	cmthomp7	Are there outlets for each row in the class?  
2018-01-11 14:06:18	patrick_xia	Not sure, but some of them are not working though 
2018-01-11 14:31:45	asuh	Should we download Anaconda for python 3.6? 
2018-01-11 15:23:35	patrick_xia	Yes anaconda is a good option but not mandatory

2018-01-12 11:58:14	riestell	Use a list comprehension to square each odd number in a list. The list is input by a sequence of comma-separated numbers.
2018-01-12 11:58:14		Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:
2018-01-12 11:58:14		1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9
2018-01-12 11:58:14		Then, the output should be:

2018-01-12 11:58:49	riestell	I am confused by question sixteen it says to square the odd numbers but the example shows odd numbers that are not squared 
2018-01-12 15:45:11	timm	Hey @riestell:  you are right. the output would should be [1,9,15,42,81].

2018-01-09 17:35:15		Good enough practices in scientific computing
2018-01-09 17:35:15		Computers are now essential in all branches of science, but most researchers are never taught the equivalent of basic lab skills for research computing. As a result, data can get lost, analyses can take much longer than necessary, and researchers are ... 
2018-01-10 15:48:05	SamuelHenderson	Just for confirmation, we are supposed to use Python 3.0 for this course? Does the version matter? 
2018-01-10 15:49:48	patrick_xia	Yes, we will use Python 3, for the actual version, I suggest to use 3.6+ for the new features 
2018-01-11 12:06:48	cmthomp7	Are there outlets for each row in the class?  
2018-01-11 14:06:18	patrick_xia	Not sure, but some of them are not working though 
2018-01-11 14:31:45	asuh	Should we download Anaconda for python 3.6? 
2018-01-11 15:23:35	patrick_xia	Yes anaconda is a good option but not mandatory 
2018-01-11 17:04:33	adbishel	Is anyone else from group C here? 
2018-01-11 17:05:31	AlexPhelps	Anaconda is great and lets you switch between Python 2 and Python 3 easily! 
2018-01-11 19:24:25	Dan.Grochmal	Will there be a link on Moodle to the Python problems? Or is it posted somewhere else? Thanks. [:+1:1] 
2018-01-11 19:32:45	patrick_xia	I think professor will post them soon

2018-01-12 11:58:14	riestell	Use a list comprehension to square each odd number in a list. The list is input by a sequence of comma-separated numbers.
2018-01-12 11:58:14		Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:
2018-01-12 11:58:14		1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9
2018-01-12 11:58:14		Then, the output should be:
2018-01-12 11:58:14		1,3,5,7,9 
2018-01-12 11:58:49	riestell	I am confused by question sixteen it says to square the odd numbers but the example shows odd numbers that are not squared 
2018-01-12 15:45:11	timm	Hey @riestell:  you are right. the output would should be [1,9,15,42,81]. 
2018-01-12 15:45:11		but no worries. when we look at everyone's work we will be looking more at  "can you bang the rocks together" 
2018-01-14 17:37:48	schan3	[1,9, 25, 49, 81] ? 
2018-01-14 17:38:46	jkayani	^ yeah I think that's what he meant 
2018-01-14 17:38:53	schan3	And should the output type be list? or just string. i.e. [1, 9, 25, 49, 81] or 1, 9, 25, 49, 81 
2018-01-14 18:00:21	patrick_xia	You can do either way  
2018-01-15 14:58:15	cmthomp7	should we strictly time the exercises to be completed in 90 minutes? Is it okay if not all of them are completed then 
2018-01-15 15:02:39	patrick_xia	Yes, please try to finish the entire problem set in 90 minutes, but it's OK if you can't complete all of them, this is a exercise for programming skill evaluation.

2018-01-09 17:35:15		Good enough practices in scientific computing
2018-01-09 17:35:15		Computers are now essential in all branches of science, but most researchers are never taught the equivalent of basic lab skills for research computing. As a result, data can get lost, analyses can take much longer than necessary, and researchers are ... 
2018-01-10 15:48:05	SamuelHenderson	Just for confirmation, we are supposed to use Python 3.0 for this course? Does the version matter? 
2018-01-10 15:49:48	patrick_xia	Yes, we will use Python 3, for the actual version, I suggest to use 3.6+ for the new features 
2018-01-11 12:06:48	cmthomp7	Are there outlets for each row in the class?  
2018-01-11 14:06:18	patrick_xia	Not sure, but some of them are not working though 
2018-01-11 14:31:45	asuh	Should we download Anaconda for python 3.6? 
2018-01-11 15:23:35	patrick_xia	Yes anaconda is a good option but not mandatory 
2018-01-11 17:04:33	adbishel	Is anyone else from group C here? 
2018-01-11 17:05:31	AlexPhelps	Anaconda is great and lets you switch between Python 2 and Python 3 easily! 
2018-01-11 19:24:25	Dan.Grochmal	Will there be a link on Moodle to the Python problems? Or is it posted somewhere else? Thanks. [:+1:1] 
2018-01-11 19:32:45	patrick_xia	I think professor will post them soon

2018-01-12 11:58:14	riestell	Use a list comprehension to square each odd number in a list. The list is input by a sequence of comma-separated numbers.
2018-01-12 11:58:14		Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:
2018-01-12 11:58:14		1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9
2018-01-12 11:58:14		Then, the output should be:
2018-01-12 11:58:14		1,3,5,7,9 
2018-01-12 11:58:49	riestell	I am confused by question sixteen it says to square the odd numbers but the example shows odd numbers that are not squared 
2018-01-12 15:45:11	timm	Hey @riestell:  you are right. the output would should be [1,9,15,42,81]. 
2018-01-12 15:45:11		but no worries. when we look at everyone's work we will be looking more at  "can you bang the rocks together" 
2018-01-14 17:37:48	schan3	[1,9, 25, 49, 81] ? 
2018-01-14 17:38:46	jkayani	^ yeah I think that's what he meant 
2018-01-14 17:38:53	schan3	And should the output type be list? or just string. i.e. [1, 9, 25, 49, 81] or 1, 9, 25, 49, 81 
2018-01-14 18:00:21	patrick_xia	You can do either way  
2018-01-15 14:58:15	cmthomp7	should we strictly time the exercises to be completed in 90 minutes? Is it okay if not all of them are completed then 
2018-01-15 15:02:39	patrick_xia	Yes, please try to finish the entire problem set in 90 minutes, but it's OK if you can't complete all of them, this is a exercise for programming skill evaluation.

2018-01-10 15:48:05	SamuelHenderson	Just for confirmation, we are supposed to use Python 3.0 for this course? Does the version matter? 
2018-01-10 15:49:48	patrick_xia	Yes, we will use Python 3, for the actual version, I suggest to use 3.6+ for the new features 
2018-01-11 12:06:48	cmthomp7	Are there outlets for each row in the class?  
2018-01-11 14:06:18	patrick_xia	Not sure, but some of them are not working though 
2018-01-11 14:31:45	asuh	Should we download Anaconda for python 3.6? 
2018-01-11 15:23:35	patrick_xia	Yes anaconda is a good option but not mandatory 
2018-01-11 17:04:33	adbishel	Is anyone else from group C here? 
2018-01-11 17:05:31	AlexPhelps	Anaconda is great and lets you switch between Python 2 and Python 3 easily!

2018-01-12 11:58:14	riestell	Use a list comprehension to square each odd number in a list. The list is input by a sequence of comma-separated numbers.
2018-01-12 11:58:14		Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:
2018-01-12 11:58:14		1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9
2018-01-12 11:58:14		Then, the output should be:
2018-01-12 11:58:14		1,3,5,7,9 
2018-01-12 11:58:49	riestell	I am confused by question sixteen it says to square the odd numbers but the example shows odd numbers that are not squared 
2018-01-12 15:45:11	timm	Hey @riestell:  you are right. the output would should be [1,9,15,42,81]. 
2018-01-12 15:45:11		but no worries. when we look at everyone's work we will be looking more at  "can you bang the rocks together" 
2018-01-14 17:37:48	schan3	[1,9, 25, 49, 81] ? 
2018-01-14 17:38:46	jkayani	^ yeah I think that's what he meant 
2018-01-14 17:38:53	schan3	And should the output type be list? or just string. i.e. [1, 9, 25, 49, 81] or 1, 9, 25, 49, 81 
2018-01-14 18:00:21	patrick_xia	You can do either way  
2018-01-15 14:58:15	cmthomp7	should we strictly time the exercises to be completed in 90 minutes? Is it okay if not all of them are completed then 
2018-01-15 15:02:39	patrick_xia	Yes, please try to finish the entire problem set in 90 minutes, but it's OK if you can't complete all of them, this is a exercise for programming skill evaluation.

2018-01-11 12:06:48	cmthomp7	Are there outlets for each row in the class?  
2018-01-11 14:06:18	patrick_xia	Not sure, but some of them are not working though 
2018-01-11 14:31:45	asuh	Should we download Anaconda for python 3.6? 
2018-01-11 15:23:35	patrick_xia	Yes anaconda is a good option but not mandatory 
2018-01-11 17:04:33	adbishel	Is anyone else from group C here? 
2018-01-11 17:05:31	AlexPhelps	Anaconda is great and lets you switch between Python 2 and Python 3 easily! 
2018-01-11 19:24:25	Dan.Grochmal	Will there be a link on Moodle to the Python problems? Or is it posted somewhere else? Thanks. [:+1:1]

2018-01-12 11:58:14	riestell	Use a list comprehension to square each odd number in a list. The list is input by a sequence of comma-separated numbers.
2018-01-12 11:58:14		Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:
2018-01-12 11:58:14		1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9
2018-01-12 11:58:14		Then, the output should be:
2018-01-12 11:58:14		1,3,5,7,9 
2018-01-12 11:58:49	riestell	I am confused by question sixteen it says to square the odd numbers but the example shows odd numbers that are not squared 
2018-01-12 15:45:11	timm	Hey @riestell:  you are right. the output would should be [1,9,15,42,81]. 
2018-01-12 15:45:11		but no worries. when we look at everyone's work we will be looking more at  "can you bang the rocks together" 
2018-01-14 17:37:48	schan3	[1,9, 25, 49, 81] ? 
2018-01-14 17:38:46	jkayani	^ yeah I think that's what he meant 
2018-01-14 17:38:53	schan3	And should the output type be list? or just string. i.e. [1, 9, 25, 49, 81] or 1, 9, 25, 49, 81 
2018-01-14 18:00:21	patrick_xia	You can do either way  
2018-01-15 14:58:15	cmthomp7	should we strictly time the exercises to be completed in 90 minutes? Is it okay if not all of them are completed then 
2018-01-15 15:02:39	patrick_xia	Yes, please try to finish the entire problem set in 90 minutes, but it's OK if you can't complete all of them, this is a exercise for programming skill evaluation.

2018-04-18 16:19:23		Note that, by Friday, I will finalize this grade timetable and update moodle to reflect these grades for these various parts of the subject.
2018-04-18 16:19:23		Note also:
2018-04-18 16:19:23		1)  The new due dates on the final deliverables : may10. NCSU regulations forbid posting a due date on exam week so we have to push to after that time. 
2018-04-18 16:19:23		2)  The due time ins **9am** on may10 and not extensions will be possible (since subject final   grades have to be submitted to the university by May 11).
2018-04-18 16:19:23		3)  And, of course, feel free to submit earlier.

2018-04-18 17:41:08	RaymondWoods	@timm so to clarify on the "Essay, review all projects", is this a 5 page paper on the essence and details, plus the 5 page paper on reviewing other people's projects? 
2018-04-22 16:08:02	AlexPhelps	I want to make sure I understand the final assignment correctly:
2018-04-22 16:08:02		Each student will complete a 5-10 page paper in the format specified.  The content is to be a deconstruction of other groups code, extracting abstractions, commenting on implementation, suggesting improvements, and evaluating possible limitations with the groups implementation (what kind of card games couldn't be made with their code?  What is missing that would be helpful/useful?)  Due May 10th.
2018-04-22 16:08:02		Is this information correct?  Key things I want to verify are 1) content and 2) that each student (and not group) has to do a paper. [:+1:2]  (edited)
2018-04-23 09:13:00	timm	1a) content = yes. 5 pages will suffice
2018-04-23 09:13:00		1b) due date = 9am may10. late submissions will be unacceptable since we have to grade before may11.
2018-04-23 09:13:00		2) **groups**, not individuals, do the essay

2018-04-23 09:26:23		No lectures this week, I need to do project meetings
2018-04-23 09:26:23		I need to meet with each group  this week to complete my grading. So sign up now. If your team misses out, I'll just have to mark the code without your help.
2018-04-23 09:26:23		At those meetings,  I  need to see at least one (but ideally, all) members of each group  at one of the  times in the sign-up sheet shown below.
2018-04-23 09:26:23		At that meeting, I will be asking you to show me what are the  abstractions in your code that might be usable in another application domain. For example, your might have used inheritance, polymorphism, OO design patterns (such as model/view, composite, visitor, etc), nested environments, grammers, type systems,  state machines, frames, rules, pattern-driven parsing, etc, etc.
2018-04-23 09:26:23		Note that I'm not expecting you to use multiple abstractions. But I will be checking for   how well  your code uses those abstractions (e.g. some intricate and beautiful dance between a very succinct  sub-class and a much more elaborate super-class methods).

2018-04-18 16:19:23		I reviewed my notes on what is due when and what I can see is the following. If this does **NOT** correspond to your expectations, please message me. 
2018-04-18 16:19:23		Note that, by Friday, I will finalize this grade timetable and update moodle to reflect these grades for these various parts of the subject.
2018-04-18 16:19:23		Note also:
2018-04-18 16:19:23		1)  The new due dates on the final deliverables : may10. NCSU regulations forbid posting a due date on exam week so we have to push to after that time. 
2018-04-18 16:19:23		2)  The due time ins **9am** on may10 and not extensions will be possible (since subject final   grades have to be submitted to the university by May 11).
2018-04-18 16:19:23		3)  And, of course, feel free to submit earlier.

2018-04-18 17:41:08	RaymondWoods	@timm so to clarify on the "Essay, review all projects", is this a 5 page paper on the essence and details, plus the 5 page paper on reviewing other people's projects? 
2018-04-22 16:08:02	AlexPhelps	I want to make sure I understand the final assignment correctly:
2018-04-22 16:08:02		Each student will complete a 5-10 page paper in the format specified.  The content is to be a deconstruction of other groups code, extracting abstractions, commenting on implementation, suggesting improvements, and evaluating possible limitations with the groups implementation (what kind of card games couldn't be made with their code?  What is missing that would be helpful/useful?)  Due May 10th.
2018-04-22 16:08:02		Is this information correct?  Key things I want to verify are 1) content and 2) that each student (and not group) has to do a paper. [:+1:2]  (edited)
2018-04-23 09:13:00	timm	1a) content = yes. 5 pages will suffice
2018-04-23 09:13:00		1b) due date = 9am may10. late submissions will be unacceptable since we have to grade before may11.
2018-04-23 09:13:00		2) **groups**, not individuals, do the essay 
2018-04-23 09:26:23	timm	=======
2018-04-23 09:26:23		No lectures this week, I need to do project meetings
2018-04-23 09:26:23		I need to meet with each group  this week to complete my grading. So sign up now. If your team misses out, I'll just have to mark the code without your help.
2018-04-23 09:26:23		At those meetings,  I  need to see at least one (but ideally, all) members of each group  at one of the  times in the sign-up sheet shown below.
2018-04-23 09:26:23		At that meeting, I will be asking you to show me what are the  abstractions in your code that might be usable in another application domain. For example, your might have used inheritance, polymorphism, OO design patterns (such as model/view, composite, visitor, etc), nested environments, grammers, type systems,  state machines, frames, rules, pattern-driven parsing, etc, etc.
2018-04-23 09:26:23		Note that I'm not expecting you to use multiple abstractions. But I will be checking for   how well  your code uses those abstractions (e.g. some intricate and beautiful dance between a very succinct  sub-class and a much more elaborate super-class methods).

2018-01-09 17:35:15		Computers are now essential in all branches of science, but most researchers are never taught the equivalent of basic lab skills for research computing. As a result, data can get lost, analyses can take much longer than necessary, and researchers are ...

2018-04-18 16:19:23		Note that, by Friday, I will finalize this grade timetable and update moodle to reflect these grades for these various parts of the subject.
2018-04-18 16:19:23		Note also:
2018-04-18 16:19:23		1)  The new due dates on the final deliverables : may10. NCSU regulations forbid posting a due date on exam week so we have to push to after that time. 
2018-04-18 16:19:23		2)  The due time ins **9am** on may10 and not extensions will be possible (since subject final   grades have to be submitted to the university by May 11).
2018-04-18 16:19:23		3)  And, of course, feel free to submit earlier.

2018-04-18 17:41:08	RaymondWoods	@timm so to clarify on the "Essay, review all projects", is this a 5 page paper on the essence and details, plus the 5 page paper on reviewing other people's projects? 
2018-04-22 16:08:02	AlexPhelps	I want to make sure I understand the final assignment correctly:
2018-04-22 16:08:02		Each student will complete a 5-10 page paper in the format specified.  The content is to be a deconstruction of other groups code, extracting abstractions, commenting on implementation, suggesting improvements, and evaluating possible limitations with the groups implementation (what kind of card games couldn't be made with their code?  What is missing that would be helpful/useful?)  Due May 10th.
2018-04-22 16:08:02		Is this information correct?  Key things I want to verify are 1) content and 2) that each student (and not group) has to do a paper. [:+1:2]  (edited)
2018-04-23 09:13:00	timm	1a) content = yes. 5 pages will suffice
2018-04-23 09:13:00		1b) due date = 9am may10. late submissions will be unacceptable since we have to grade before may11.
2018-04-23 09:13:00		2) **groups**, not individuals, do the essay 
2018-04-23 09:26:23	timm	=======
2018-04-23 09:26:23		No lectures this week, I need to do project meetings
2018-04-23 09:26:23		I need to meet with each group  this week to complete my grading. So sign up now. If your team misses out, I'll just have to mark the code without your help.
2018-04-23 09:26:23		At those meetings,  I  need to see at least one (but ideally, all) members of each group  at one of the  times in the sign-up sheet shown below.
2018-04-23 09:26:23		At that meeting, I will be asking you to show me what are the  abstractions in your code that might be usable in another application domain. For example, your might have used inheritance, polymorphism, OO design patterns (such as model/view, composite, visitor, etc), nested environments, grammers, type systems,  state machines, frames, rules, pattern-driven parsing, etc, etc.
2018-04-23 09:26:23		Note that I'm not expecting you to use multiple abstractions. But I will be checking for   how well  your code uses those abstractions (e.g. some intricate and beautiful dance between a very succinct  sub-class and a much more elaborate super-class methods).

This date wasn't mentioned within the first week of classes, so it shouldn't interfere with studying for exams and final projects that were planned in the first week @patrick_xia @timm 
2018-04-23 21:33:43		@MattGray commented on @patrick_xia?s file https://plm18.slack.com/files/U8P87UNR2/FAA4QRDPG/total_plan.png (grades): Agreed with this. I and others have early exams this week, exams during exam weeks (which finish the night before this is due), and then this exam to study for two days before. The due date extension was nice because it made my short-term much better, but that due date is still very rough in regards to everything going on around it, which is a lot.  
2018-04-23 21:42:45		@gjabell commented on @patrick_xia?s file https://plm18.slack.com/files/U8P87UNR2/FAA4QRDPG/total_plan.png (grades): I agree with this too; extending the due date until right after exams doesn't really solve the issue of it taking time away from studying, which should be the sole focus of the exam period. 
2018-04-23 21:46:32	patrick_xia	Project 3 is mandatory, it worth 15 points so it's impossible to get a good grade without it (the rest mandatory part is only 85, so you need to do project 3, sorry..)
2018-04-23 21:46:32		Its due on May 10 is because Dr. Menzies wants to offer extra time to finish it. Yes it may bring some time conflicts to the exams, change due date is optional, do you guys have some ideas about this? 
2018-04-23 21:52:51	camara	Did the department head agree to this due date? I think the department head has to agree to a special circumstance in order to make a due date after April 23rd (last week of classes) 
2018-04-23 21:58:32	timm	this is some misinformation going around about this issue.
2018-04-23 21:58:32		someone has incorrectly said that  a May10 deadline is a violation of ncsu policy. 
2018-04-23 21:58:32		this is not correct
2018-04-23 21:58:32		as stated in the Policies, Regualtions and Rules, Assignments should not have a due date during the final exam period unless the assignment constitutes a part of the final exam.  now according to  https://studentservices.ncsu.edu/calendars/academic/#spring, the exam week ends May9. 
2018-04-23 21:58:32		so there us no policy violation re May10

2018-04-23 21:59:26	timm	at issue here is the final 5 page essay. which is a group project.  which could easily be done this week, before exams (given that lectures have now become project review). 
2018-04-23 21:59:36	timm	so good luck with your exams. 
2018-04-23 22:03:33	camara	I wonder if that is how that regulation was intended to be used :thinking_face: [:+1:2] 
2018-04-23 22:05:12	MattGray	So what I?ve been discussing with people is that, even if done now, we?d still be doing the assignment during our dead week, for many people including myself, this week is study week for initial exams and exams taking place during this week. Then if people who are studying this week can?t do it this week, we have to do it during our two finals weeks because there?s about 12 hours to do between the due date and the end of finals. Sure, it?s only 5 pages, but that?s still another significant assignment we all have on top of finals.  [:+1:2] 
2018-04-23 22:05:20	Jesse	If you believe that this assignment is ethical, just get the Dean and the Computer Science Department head to verify it. It should be easy for you if you truly believe its right. [:+1:3] 
2018-04-23 22:08:19	MattGray	Yeah, I completely agree with Christina and Jesse. It?s not during finals, but on top of studying for this class?s final, all of the work for this paper would be done during dead week and finals week, which seems to exploit the intention of the regulation.  
2018-04-23 22:11:01	gjabell	Without trying to sound too inflammatory, this does strike me as a somewhat scummy attempt to find a loophole for the no-projects-during-exam-week regulation. It seems to me that once the exam period is finished we shouldn't be expected to complete any additional assignments (in fact, this really should be the case as soon as the final exam for a class is finished, considering that it is, in fact, the final exam). Additionally (although this may be somewhat unrelated), students in residence halls are expected to move out within 24 hours of their last exam, which would suggest that the semester is considered over once you complete your last exam. Really, the only reason that there is a day in between the last exam day and the due date for grades is allow enough time for instructors to grade final exams that happen on the very last day of exams, not to be used as an additional time to turn in assignments. [:+1:2] 
2018-04-23 22:44:20	jkayani	Here's the full text of the cited regulation (https://policies.ncsu.edu/regulation/reg-02-20-14/):
2018-04-23 22:44:20		>2.  NO MAJOR TESTS IN FINAL WEEK OF CLASSES
2018-04-23 22:44:20		Lab tests and semester project reports and presentations are permissible during the final week of classes. Papers and homework may have a due date during the final week of classes only if scheduled in the syllabus.  However, in order for students to prepare for final examinations, faculty members may not assign other tests, quizzes or additional papers during the final week of classes.  Assignments should not have a due date during the final exam period unless the assignment constitutes a part of the final exam.  Exceptions to this policy must be approved in advance by the department head and the dean of the college involved.  Students should contact the appropriate instructor or department head if they believe an assignment is not in compliance with this regulation. 
2018-04-23 22:48:25	jkayani	I find it rather hard to believe that this policy was written with the intent that assignments could be due after final exam week. 
2018-04-23 22:48:25		Additionally, the requirements for this paper were reconsidered during last Tuesday's class, when someone brought up they'd already written an "Essence and Details" paper and not a "Critique everyone else's code" paper; the instructor said "Let me get back to you on that", and further clarification as requested during this past week [here, April 17](https://plm18.slack.com/archives/C8XEYFDR8/p1524005802000013), [here, April 18](https://plm18.slack.com/archives/C8MBQTZ50/p1524087668000124), and [here, April 22](https://plm18.slack.com/archives/C8MBQTZ50/p1524427682000126) wasn't given until [today, April 23](https://plm18.slack.com/archives/C8MBQTZ50/p1524489180000587). It could perhaps be argued that the assignment wasn't actually assigned until today since the class wasn't even sure whether it was a group assignment or not, nor aware of the content requirements, which as per the above regulation is forbidden. 
2018-04-23 22:48:25		TL;DR: I take issue with: a.) the ever changing and poorly communicated requirements for this paper; b.) the fact that it's due after exams, which seems rather ludicrous.
2018-04-23 22:48:25		Tadicke3: Question: For the report, does every team do one report, or does every person do their own report?
2018-04-23 22:48:25		Raymond Woods: @timm so to clarify on the "Essay, review all projects", is this a 5 page paper on the essence and details, plus the 5 page paper on reviewing other people's projects?

2018-01-09 17:35:15		Good enough practices in scientific computing
2018-01-09 17:35:15		Computers are now essential in all branches of science, but most researchers are never taught the equivalent of basic lab skills for research computing. As a result, data can get lost, analyses can take much longer than necessary, and researchers are ... 
2018-01-10 15:48:05	SamuelHenderson	Just for confirmation, we are supposed to use Python 3.0 for this course? Does the version matter? 
2018-01-10 15:49:48	patrick_xia	Yes, we will use Python 3, for the actual version, I suggest to use 3.6+ for the new features 
2018-01-11 12:06:48	cmthomp7	Are there outlets for each row in the class?  
2018-01-11 14:06:18	patrick_xia	Not sure, but some of them are not working though 
2018-01-11 14:31:45	asuh	Should we download Anaconda for python 3.6? 
2018-01-11 15:23:35	patrick_xia	Yes anaconda is a good option but not mandatory 
2018-01-11 17:04:33	adbishel	Is anyone else from group C here? 
2018-01-11 17:05:31	AlexPhelps	Anaconda is great and lets you switch between Python 2 and Python 3 easily! 
2018-01-11 19:24:25	Dan.Grochmal	Will there be a link on Moodle to the Python problems? Or is it posted somewhere else? Thanks. [:+1:1] 
2018-01-11 19:32:45	patrick_xia	I think professor will post them soon

2018-01-12 11:58:14	riestell	Use a list comprehension to square each odd number in a list. The list is input by a sequence of comma-separated numbers.
2018-01-12 11:58:14		Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:
2018-01-12 11:58:14		1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9
2018-01-12 11:58:14		Then, the output should be:
2018-01-12 11:58:14		1,3,5,7,9 
2018-01-12 11:58:49	riestell	I am confused by question sixteen it says to square the odd numbers but the example shows odd numbers that are not squared 
2018-01-12 15:45:11	timm	Hey @riestell:  you are right. the output would should be [1,9,15,42,81]. 
2018-01-12 15:45:11		but no worries. when we look at everyone's work we will be looking more at  "can you bang the rocks together" 
2018-01-14 17:37:48	schan3	[1,9, 25, 49, 81] ? 
2018-01-14 17:38:46	jkayani	^ yeah I think that's what he meant 
2018-01-14 17:38:53	schan3	And should the output type be list? or just string. i.e. [1, 9, 25, 49, 81] or 1, 9, 25, 49, 81 
2018-01-14 18:00:21	patrick_xia	You can do either way  
2018-01-15 14:58:15	cmthomp7	should we strictly time the exercises to be completed in 90 minutes? Is it okay if not all of them are completed then 
2018-01-15 15:02:39	patrick_xia	Yes, please try to finish the entire problem set in 90 minutes, but it's OK if you can't complete all of them, this is a exercise for programming skill evaluation.

2018-04-18 16:19:23		I reviewed my notes on what is due when and what I can see is the following. If this does **NOT** correspond to your expectations, please message me. 
2018-04-18 16:19:23		Note that, by Friday, I will finalize this grade timetable and update moodle to reflect these grades for these various parts of the subject.
2018-04-18 16:19:23		Note also:
2018-04-18 16:19:23		1)  The new due dates on the final deliverables : may10. NCSU regulations forbid posting a due date on exam week so we have to push to after that time. 
2018-04-18 16:19:23		2)  The due time ins **9am** on may10 and not extensions will be possible (since subject final   grades have to be submitted to the university by May 11).
2018-04-18 16:19:23		3)  And, of course, feel free to submit earlier.

2018-04-18 17:41:08	RaymondWoods	@timm so to clarify on the "Essay, review all projects", is this a 5 page paper on the essence and details, plus the 5 page paper on reviewing other people's projects? 
2018-04-22 16:08:02	AlexPhelps	I want to make sure I understand the final assignment correctly:
2018-04-22 16:08:02		Each student will complete a 5-10 page paper in the format specified.  The content is to be a deconstruction of other groups code, extracting abstractions, commenting on implementation, suggesting improvements, and evaluating possible limitations with the groups implementation (what kind of card games couldn't be made with their code?  What is missing that would be helpful/useful?)  Due May 10th.
2018-04-22 16:08:02		Is this information correct?  Key things I want to verify are 1) content and 2) that each student (and not group) has to do a paper. [:+1:2]  (edited)
2018-04-23 09:13:00	timm	1a) content = yes. 5 pages will suffice
2018-04-23 09:13:00		1b) due date = 9am may10. late submissions will be unacceptable since we have to grade before may11.
2018-04-23 09:13:00		2) **groups**, not individuals, do the essay 
2018-04-23 09:26:23	timm	=======
2018-04-23 09:26:23		No lectures this week, I need to do project meetings
2018-04-23 09:26:23		I need to meet with each group  this week to complete my grading. So sign up now. If your team misses out, I'll just have to mark the code without your help.
2018-04-23 09:26:23		At those meetings,  I  need to see at least one (but ideally, all) members of each group  at one of the  times in the sign-up sheet shown below.
2018-04-23 09:26:23		At that meeting, I will be asking you to show me what are the  abstractions in your code that might be usable in another application domain. For example, your might have used inheritance, polymorphism, OO design patterns (such as model/view, composite, visitor, etc), nested environments, grammers, type systems,  state machines, frames, rules, pattern-driven parsing, etc, etc.
2018-04-23 09:26:23		Note that I'm not expecting you to use multiple abstractions. But I will be checking for   how well  your code uses those abstractions (e.g. some intricate and beautiful dance between a very succinct  sub-class and a much more elaborate super-class methods).

This date wasn't mentioned within the first week of classes, so it shouldn't interfere with studying for exams and final projects that were planned in the first week @patrick_xia @timm 
2018-04-23 21:33:43		@MattGray commented on @patrick_xia?s file https://plm18.slack.com/files/U8P87UNR2/FAA4QRDPG/total_plan.png (grades): Agreed with this. I and others have early exams this week, exams during exam weeks (which finish the night before this is due), and then this exam to study for two days before. The due date extension was nice because it made my short-term much better, but that due date is still very rough in regards to everything going on around it, which is a lot.  
2018-04-23 21:42:45		@gjabell commented on @patrick_xia?s file https://plm18.slack.com/files/U8P87UNR2/FAA4QRDPG/total_plan.png (grades): I agree with this too; extending the due date until right after exams doesn't really solve the issue of it taking time away from studying, which should be the sole focus of the exam period. 
2018-04-23 21:46:32	patrick_xia	Project 3 is mandatory, it worth 15 points so it's impossible to get a good grade without it (the rest mandatory part is only 85, so you need to do project 3, sorry..)
2018-04-23 21:46:32		Its due on May 10 is because Dr. Menzies wants to offer extra time to finish it. Yes it may bring some time conflicts to the exams, change due date is optional, do you guys have some ideas about this? 
2018-04-23 21:52:51	camara	Did the department head agree to this due date? I think the department head has to agree to a special circumstance in order to make a due date after April 23rd (last week of classes) 
2018-04-23 21:58:32	timm	this is some misinformation going around about this issue.
2018-04-23 21:58:32		someone has incorrectly said that  a May10 deadline is a violation of ncsu policy. 
2018-04-23 21:58:32		this is not correct
2018-04-23 21:58:32		as stated in the Policies, Regualtions and Rules, Assignments should not have a due date during the final exam period unless the assignment constitutes a part of the final exam.  now according to  https://studentservices.ncsu.edu/calendars/academic/#spring, the exam week ends May9. 
2018-04-23 21:58:32		so there us no policy violation re May10

2018-04-23 21:59:26	timm	at issue here is the final 5 page essay. which is a group project.  which could easily be done this week, before exams (given that lectures have now become project review). 
2018-04-23 21:59:36	timm	so good luck with your exams. 
2018-04-23 22:03:33	camara	I wonder if that is how that regulation was intended to be used :thinking_face: [:+1:2] 
2018-04-23 22:05:12	MattGray	So what I?ve been discussing with people is that, even if done now, we?d still be doing the assignment during our dead week, for many people including myself, this week is study week for initial exams and exams taking place during this week. Then if people who are studying this week can?t do it this week, we have to do it during our two finals weeks because there?s about 12 hours to do between the due date and the end of finals. Sure, it?s only 5 pages, but that?s still another significant assignment we all have on top of finals.  [:+1:2] 
2018-04-23 22:05:20	Jesse	If you believe that this assignment is ethical, just get the Dean and the Computer Science Department head to verify it. It should be easy for you if you truly believe its right. [:+1:3] 
2018-04-23 22:08:19	MattGray	Yeah, I completely agree with Christina and Jesse. It?s not during finals, but on top of studying for this class?s final, all of the work for this paper would be done during dead week and finals week, which seems to exploit the intention of the regulation.  
2018-04-23 22:11:01	gjabell	Without trying to sound too inflammatory, this does strike me as a somewhat scummy attempt to find a loophole for the no-projects-during-exam-week regulation. It seems to me that once the exam period is finished we shouldn't be expected to complete any additional assignments (in fact, this really should be the case as soon as the final exam for a class is finished, considering that it is, in fact, the final exam). Additionally (although this may be somewhat unrelated), students in residence halls are expected to move out within 24 hours of their last exam, which would suggest that the semester is considered over once you complete your last exam. Really, the only reason that there is a day in between the last exam day and the due date for grades is allow enough time for instructors to grade final exams that happen on the very last day of exams, not to be used as an additional time to turn in assignments. [:+1:3] 
2018-04-23 22:44:20	jkayani	Here's the full text of the cited regulation (https://policies.ncsu.edu/regulation/reg-02-20-14/):
2018-04-23 22:44:20		>2.  NO MAJOR TESTS IN FINAL WEEK OF CLASSES
2018-04-23 22:44:20		Lab tests and semester project reports and presentations are permissible during the final week of classes. Papers and homework may have a due date during the final week of classes only if scheduled in the syllabus.  However, in order for students to prepare for final examinations, faculty members may not assign other tests, quizzes or additional papers during the final week of classes.  Assignments should not have a due date during the final exam period unless the assignment constitutes a part of the final exam.  Exceptions to this policy must be approved in advance by the department head and the dean of the college involved.  Students should contact the appropriate instructor or department head if they believe an assignment is not in compliance with this regulation. 
2018-04-23 22:48:25	jkayani	I find it rather hard to believe that this policy was written with the intent that assignments could be due after final exam week. 
2018-04-23 22:48:25		Additionally, the requirements for this paper were reconsidered during last Tuesday's class, when someone brought up they'd already written an "Essence and Details" paper and not a "Critique everyone else's code" paper; the instructor said "Let me get back to you on that", and further clarification as requested during this past week [here, April 17](https://plm18.slack.com/archives/C8XEYFDR8/p1524005802000013), [here, April 18](https://plm18.slack.com/archives/C8MBQTZ50/p1524087668000124), and [here, April 22](https://plm18.slack.com/archives/C8MBQTZ50/p1524427682000126) wasn't given until [today, April 23](https://plm18.slack.com/archives/C8MBQTZ50/p1524489180000587). It could perhaps be argued that the assignment wasn't actually assigned until today since the class wasn't even sure whether it was a group assignment or not, nor aware of the content requirements, which as per the above regulation is forbidden. 
2018-04-23 22:48:25		TL;DR: I take issue with: a.) the ever changing and poorly communicated requirements for this paper; b.) the fact that it's due after exams, which seems rather ludicrous.
2018-04-23 22:48:25		Tadicke3: Question: For the report, does every team do one report, or does every person do their own report?
2018-04-23 22:48:25		Raymond Woods: @timm so to clarify on the "Essay, review all projects", is this a 5 page paper on the essence and details, plus the 5 page paper on reviewing other people's projects?
2018-04-23 22:48:25		Alex Phelps: I want to make sure I understand the final assignment correctly:
2018-04-23 22:48:25		Each student will complete a 5-10 page paper in the format specified.  The content is to be a deconstruction of other groups code, extracting abstractions, commenting on implementation, suggesting improvements, and evaluating possible limitations with the groups implementation (what kind of card games couldn't be made with their code?  What is missing that would be helpful/useful?)  Due May 10th.
2018-04-23 22:48:25		Is this information correct?  Key things I want to verify are 1) content and 2) that each student (and not group) has to do a paper.
2018-04-23 22:48:25		Tim Menzies: 1a) content = yes. 5 pages will suffice
2018-04-23 22:48:25		1b) due date = 9am may10. late submissions will be unacceptable since we have to grade before may11.
2018-04-23 22:48:25		2) **groups**, not individuals, do the essay 
2018-04-23 23:50:38	RaymondWoods	I don't intend to argue about the regulations or ethics because I don't understand them, but I figured as a member of allegedly the only group that did the previous essay assignment, I would say a few things:
2018-04-23 23:50:38		1. While 5 pages in the given format seems daunting, it honestly could get done in a day. Maybe it wouldn't be of proper quality, but it would be possible
2018-04-23 23:50:38		2. I do agree that changing or unclear deadlines is frustrating, but he was up front at the beginning that the class is rather experimental. Tim decided to give our group extra credit for the essay we did, which he didn't have to do at all.
2018-04-23 23:50:38		3. This third point came across as condescending so I gave up and erased it. 
2018-04-24 00:03:50	jkayani	You're right Raymond - that was generous of Dr. Menzies for giving you credit for the work your group did. However, I can't say I agree that just because the course is experimental, it can play "fast and loose" with requirements and deadlines. 
2018-04-24 00:03:50		I think it's important we hear everyone's perspective on this, and I'd like to encourage open dialogue on the matter. I hope I didn't misrepresent anyone in stating my opinion on the matter, and ask that you speak up if I did. [:+1:3]  (edited)
2018-04-24 00:56:11	ejgillia	This is a lot of moaning to get out of a 5 page paper. 5 pages of arguments have probably been written in this chat lmao 
2018-04-24 01:19:16	Jesse	I am making no argument of the assignment's difficulty and I dont think my peers are either. I am only arguing the ethics  of this assignment as well as its deadline based on the rules and regulations brought forth. These rules are not terribly specific and do not specify the definition of "exam period" (which is the root of this issue). Therefore, I want this to be a decision that is brought forth to the head of the department as well as the dean of engineering as the rules and regulations have intended. Only they have the right to determine what is and is not an "exam period", and end this debate on policies.
2018-04-24 01:19:16		Everyone's opinions thus far has been important in proving that the rules and regulations has a piece of information which has lead to multiple interprettations. [:+1:1]

2018-01-10 15:48:05	SamuelHenderson	Just for confirmation, we are supposed to use Python 3.0 for this course? Does the version matter? 
2018-01-10 15:49:48	patrick_xia	Yes, we will use Python 3, for the actual version, I suggest to use 3.6+ for the new features 
2018-01-11 12:06:48	cmthomp7	Are there outlets for each row in the class?  
2018-01-11 14:06:18	patrick_xia	Not sure, but some of them are not working though 
2018-01-11 14:31:45	asuh	Should we download Anaconda for python 3.6?

2018-01-12 11:58:14	riestell	Use a list comprehension to square each odd number in a list. The list is input by a sequence of comma-separated numbers.
2018-01-12 11:58:14		Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:
2018-01-12 11:58:14		1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9
2018-01-12 11:58:14		Then, the output should be:
2018-01-12 11:58:14		1,3,5,7,9 
2018-01-12 11:58:49	riestell	I am confused by question sixteen it says to square the odd numbers but the example shows odd numbers that are not squared 
2018-01-12 15:45:11	timm	Hey @riestell:  you are right. the output would should be [1,9,15,42,81]. 
2018-01-12 15:45:11		but no worries. when we look at everyone's work we will be looking more at  "can you bang the rocks together" 
2018-01-14 17:37:48	schan3	[1,9, 25, 49, 81] ? 
2018-01-14 17:38:46	jkayani	^ yeah I think that's what he meant 
2018-01-14 17:38:53	schan3	And should the output type be list? or just string. i.e. [1, 9, 25, 49, 81] or 1, 9, 25, 49, 81 
2018-01-14 18:00:21	patrick_xia	You can do either way  
2018-01-15 14:58:15	cmthomp7	should we strictly time the exercises to be completed in 90 minutes? Is it okay if not all of them are completed then 
2018-01-15 15:02:39	patrick_xia	Yes, please try to finish the entire problem set in 90 minutes, but it's OK if you can't complete all of them, this is a exercise for programming skill evaluation.

2018-03-19 14:23:10		GitLab compared to other tools
2018-03-19 14:23:10		This page compares the features of GitLab software to non-GitLab software. Review the pros and cons of each to help make your decision easier. 
2018-03-19 14:25:30	Dax	Main reasons I prefer GitLab are more intuitive interface, builtin CI, and team creation/management, free private repos are also nice  (edited)
2018-03-19 15:08:56	gjabell	Also github has the wonderful irony of being the worlds largest repository of open source code, while not being open source itself [:handshake:4]

2018-04-18 16:19:23	patrick_xia	@timm here. 
2018-04-18 16:19:23		I reviewed my notes on what is due when and what I can see is the following. If this does **NOT** correspond to your expectations, please message me. 
2018-04-18 16:19:23		Note that, by Friday, I will finalize this grade timetable and update moodle to reflect these grades for these various parts of the subject.
2018-04-18 16:19:23		Note also:
2018-04-18 16:19:23		1)  The new due dates on the final deliverables : may10. NCSU regulations forbid posting a due date on exam week so we have to push to after that time. 
2018-04-18 16:19:23		2)  The due time ins **9am** on may10 and not extensions will be possible (since subject final   grades have to be submitted to the university by May 11).
2018-04-18 16:19:23		3)  And, of course, feel free to submit earlier.

2018-04-18 17:41:08	RaymondWoods	@timm so to clarify on the "Essay, review all projects", is this a 5 page paper on the essence and details, plus the 5 page paper on reviewing other people's projects? 
2018-04-22 16:08:02	AlexPhelps	I want to make sure I understand the final assignment correctly:
2018-04-22 16:08:02		Each student will complete a 5-10 page paper in the format specified.  The content is to be a deconstruction of other groups code, extracting abstractions, commenting on implementation, suggesting improvements, and evaluating possible limitations with the groups implementation (what kind of card games couldn't be made with their code?  What is missing that would be helpful/useful?)  Due May 10th.
2018-04-22 16:08:02		Is this information correct?  Key things I want to verify are 1) content and 2) that each student (and not group) has to do a paper. [:+1:2]  (edited)
2018-04-23 09:13:00	timm	1a) content = yes. 5 pages will suffice
2018-04-23 09:13:00		1b) due date = 9am may10. late submissions will be unacceptable since we have to grade before may11.
2018-04-23 09:13:00		2) **groups**, not individuals, do the essay 
2018-04-23 09:26:23	timm	=======
2018-04-23 09:26:23		No lectures this week, I need to do project meetings
2018-04-23 09:26:23		I need to meet with each group  this week to complete my grading. So sign up now. If your team misses out, I'll just have to mark the code without your help.
2018-04-23 09:26:23		At those meetings,  I  need to see at least one (but ideally, all) members of each group  at one of the  times in the sign-up sheet shown below.
2018-04-23 09:26:23		At that meeting, I will be asking you to show me what are the  abstractions in your code that might be usable in another application domain. For example, your might have used inheritance, polymorphism, OO design patterns (such as model/view, composite, visitor, etc), nested environments, grammers, type systems,  state machines, frames, rules, pattern-driven parsing, etc, etc.
2018-04-23 09:26:23		Note that I'm not expecting you to use multiple abstractions. But I will be checking for   how well  your code uses those abstractions (e.g. some intricate and beautiful dance between a very succinct  sub-class and a much more elaborate super-class methods).

This date wasn't mentioned within the first week of classes, so it shouldn't interfere with studying for exams and final projects that were planned in the first week @patrick_xia @timm 
2018-04-23 21:33:43		@MattGray commented on @patrick_xia’s file https://plm18.slack.com/files/U8P87UNR2/FAA4QRDPG/total_plan.png (grades): Agreed with this. I and others have early exams this week, exams during exam weeks (which finish the night before this is due), and then this exam to study for two days before. The due date extension was nice because it made my short-term much better, but that due date is still very rough in regards to everything going on around it, which is a lot.  
2018-04-23 21:42:45		@gjabell commented on @patrick_xia’s file https://plm18.slack.com/files/U8P87UNR2/FAA4QRDPG/total_plan.png (grades): I agree with this too; extending the due date until right after exams doesn't really solve the issue of it taking time away from studying, which should be the sole focus of the exam period. 
2018-04-23 21:46:32	patrick_xia	Project 3 is mandatory, it worth 15 points so it's impossible to get a good grade without it (the rest mandatory part is only 85, so you need to do project 3, sorry..)
2018-04-23 21:46:32		Its due on May 10 is because Dr. Menzies wants to offer extra time to finish it. Yes it may bring some time conflicts to the exams, change due date is optional, do you guys have some ideas about this? 
2018-04-23 21:52:51	camara	Did the department head agree to this due date? I think the department head has to agree to a special circumstance in order to make a due date after April 23rd (last week of classes) 
2018-04-23 21:58:32	timm	this is some misinformation going around about this issue.
2018-04-23 21:58:32		someone has incorrectly said that  a May10 deadline is a violation of ncsu policy. 
2018-04-23 21:58:32		this is not correct
2018-04-23 21:58:32		as stated in the Policies, Regualtions and Rules, Assignments should not have a due date during the final exam period unless the assignment constitutes a part of the final exam.  now according to  https://studentservices.ncsu.edu/calendars/academic/#spring, the exam week ends May9. 
2018-04-23 21:58:32		so there us no policy violation re May10

2018-04-23 21:59:26	timm	at issue here is the final 5 page essay. which is a group project.  which could easily be done this week, before exams (given that lectures have now become project review). 
2018-04-23 21:59:36	timm	so good luck with your exams. 
2018-04-23 22:03:33	camara	I wonder if that is how that regulation was intended to be used :thinking_face: [:+1:2] 
2018-04-23 22:05:12	MattGray	So what I’ve been discussing with people is that, even if done now, we’d still be doing the assignment during our dead week, for many people including myself, this week is study week for initial exams and exams taking place during this week. Then if people who are studying this week can’t do it this week, we have to do it during our two finals weeks because there’s about 12 hours to do between the due date and the end of finals. Sure, it’s only 5 pages, but that’s still another significant assignment we all have on top of finals.  [:+1:2] 
2018-04-23 22:05:20	Jesse	If you believe that this assignment is ethical, just get the Dean and the Computer Science Department head to verify it. It should be easy for you if you truly believe its right. [:+1:3] 
2018-04-23 22:08:19	MattGray	Yeah, I completely agree with Christina and Jesse. It’s not during finals, but on top of studying for this class’s final, all of the work for this paper would be done during dead week and finals week, which seems to exploit the intention of the regulation.  
2018-04-23 22:11:01	gjabell	Without trying to sound too inflammatory, this does strike me as a somewhat scummy attempt to find a loophole for the no-projects-during-exam-week regulation. It seems to me that once the exam period is finished we shouldn't be expected to complete any additional assignments (in fact, this really should be the case as soon as the final exam for a class is finished, considering that it is, in fact, the final exam). Additionally (although this may be somewhat unrelated), students in residence halls are expected to move out within 24 hours of their last exam, which would suggest that the semester is considered over once you complete your last exam. Really, the only reason that there is a day in between the last exam day and the due date for grades is allow enough time for instructors to grade final exams that happen on the very last day of exams, not to be used as an additional time to turn in assignments. [:+1:3] 
2018-04-23 22:44:20	jkayani	Here's the full text of the cited regulation (https://policies.ncsu.edu/regulation/reg-02-20-14/):
2018-04-23 22:44:20		>2.  NO MAJOR TESTS IN FINAL WEEK OF CLASSES
2018-04-23 22:44:20		Lab tests and semester project reports and presentations are permissible during the final week of classes. Papers and homework may have a due date during the final week of classes only if scheduled in the syllabus.  However, in order for students to prepare for final examinations, faculty members may not assign other tests, quizzes or additional papers during the final week of classes.  Assignments should not have a due date during the final exam period unless the assignment constitutes a part of the final exam.  Exceptions to this policy must be approved in advance by the department head and the dean of the college involved.  Students should contact the appropriate instructor or department head if they believe an assignment is not in compliance with this regulation. 
2018-04-23 22:48:25	jkayani	I find it rather hard to believe that this policy was written with the intent that assignments could be due after final exam week. 
2018-04-23 22:48:25		Additionally, the requirements for this paper were reconsidered during last Tuesday's class, when someone brought up they'd already written an "Essence and Details" paper and not a "Critique everyone else's code" paper; the instructor said "Let me get back to you on that", and further clarification as requested during this past week [here, April 17](https://plm18.slack.com/archives/C8XEYFDR8/p1524005802000013), [here, April 18](https://plm18.slack.com/archives/C8MBQTZ50/p1524087668000124), and [here, April 22](https://plm18.slack.com/archives/C8MBQTZ50/p1524427682000126) wasn't given until [today, April 23](https://plm18.slack.com/archives/C8MBQTZ50/p1524489180000587). It could perhaps be argued that the assignment wasn't actually assigned until today since the class wasn't even sure whether it was a group assignment or not, nor aware of the content requirements, which as per the above regulation is forbidden. 
2018-04-23 22:48:25		TL;DR: I take issue with: a.) the ever changing and poorly communicated requirements for this paper; b.) the fact that it's due after exams, which seems rather ludicrous.
2018-04-23 22:48:25		Tadicke3: Question: For the report, does every team do one report, or does every person do their own report?
2018-04-23 22:48:25		Raymond Woods: @timm so to clarify on the "Essay, review all projects", is this a 5 page paper on the essence and details, plus the 5 page paper on reviewing other people's projects?
2018-04-23 22:48:25		Alex Phelps: I want to make sure I understand the final assignment correctly:

2018-04-23 22:48:25		Tim Menzies: 1a) content = yes. 5 pages will suffice

2018-04-23 22:48:25		2) **groups**, not individuals, do the essay 
2018-04-23 23:50:38	RaymondWoods	I don't intend to argue about the regulations or ethics because I don't understand them, but I figured as a member of allegedly the only group that did the previous essay assignment, I would say a few things:
2018-04-23 23:50:38		1. While 5 pages in the given format seems daunting, it honestly could get done in a day. Maybe it wouldn't be of proper quality, but it would be possible
2018-04-23 23:50:38		2. I do agree that changing or unclear deadlines is frustrating, but he was up front at the beginning that the class is rather experimental. Tim decided to give our group extra credit for the essay we did, which he didn't have to do at all.
2018-04-23 23:50:38		3. This third point came across as condescending so I gave up and erased it. 
2018-04-24 00:03:50	jkayani	You're right Raymond - that was generous of Dr. Menzies for giving you credit for the work your group did. However, I can't say I agree that just because the course is experimental, it can play "fast and loose" with requirements and deadlines. 
2018-04-24 00:03:50		I think it's important we hear everyone's perspective on this, and I'd like to encourage open dialogue on the matter. I hope I didn't misrepresent anyone in stating my opinion on the matter, and ask that you speak up if I did. [:+1:3]  (edited)
2018-04-24 00:56:11	ejgillia	This is a lot of moaning to get out of a 5 page paper. 5 pages of arguments have probably been written in this chat lmao 
2018-04-24 01:19:16	Jesse	I am making no argument of the assignment's difficulty and I dont think my peers are either. I am only arguing the ethics  of this assignment as well as its deadline based on the rules and regulations brought forth. These rules are not terribly specific and do not specify the definition of "exam period" (which is the root of this issue). Therefore, I want this to be a decision that is brought forth to the head of the department as well as the dean of engineering as the rules and regulations have intended. Only they have the right to determine what is and is not an "exam period", and end this debate on policies.
2018-04-24 01:19:16		Everyone's opinions thus far has been important in proving that the rules and regulations has a piece of information which has lead to multiple interprettations. [:+1:1] 
2018-04-24 07:50:46	timm	The people have spoken.
2018-04-24 07:50:46		 Essay cancelled.

2018-01-09 17:35:15		Computers are now essential in all branches of science, but most researchers are never taught the equivalent of basic lab skills for research computing. As a result, data can get lost, analyses can take much longer than necessary, and researchers are ... 
2018-01-10 15:48:05	SamuelHenderson	Just for confirmation, we are supposed to use Python 3.0 for this course? Does the version matter? 
2018-01-10 15:49:48	patrick_xia	Yes, we will use Python 3, for the actual version, I suggest to use 3.6+ for the new features

2018-01-12 11:58:14	riestell	Use a list comprehension to square each odd number in a list. The list is input by a sequence of comma-separated numbers.
2018-01-12 11:58:14		Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:
2018-01-12 11:58:14		1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9
2018-01-12 11:58:14		Then, the output should be:
2018-01-12 11:58:14		1,3,5,7,9 
2018-01-12 11:58:49	riestell	I am confused by question sixteen it says to square the odd numbers but the example shows odd numbers that are not squared 
2018-01-12 15:45:11	timm	Hey @riestell:  you are right. the output would should be [1,9,15,42,81]. 
2018-01-12 15:45:11		but no worries. when we look at everyone's work we will be looking more at  "can you bang the rocks together" 
2018-01-14 17:37:48	schan3	[1,9, 25, 49, 81] ? 
2018-01-14 17:38:46	jkayani	^ yeah I think that's what he meant 
2018-01-14 17:38:53	schan3	And should the output type be list? or just string. i.e. [1, 9, 25, 49, 81] or 1, 9, 25, 49, 81 
2018-01-14 18:00:21	patrick_xia	You can do either way  
2018-01-15 14:58:15	cmthomp7	should we strictly time the exercises to be completed in 90 minutes? Is it okay if not all of them are completed then 
2018-01-15 15:02:39	patrick_xia	Yes, please try to finish the entire problem set in 90 minutes, but it's OK if you can't complete all of them, this is a exercise for programming skill evaluation.

2018-04-18 16:19:23		Note that, by Friday, I will finalize this grade timetable and update moodle to reflect these grades for these various parts of the subject.
2018-04-18 16:19:23		Note also:
2018-04-18 16:19:23		1)  The new due dates on the final deliverables : may10. NCSU regulations forbid posting a due date on exam week so we have to push to after that time. 
2018-04-18 16:19:23		2)  The due time ins **9am** on may10 and not extensions will be possible (since subject final   grades have to be submitted to the university by May 11).
2018-04-18 16:19:23		3)  And, of course, feel free to submit earlier.

2018-04-18 17:41:08	RaymondWoods	@timm so to clarify on the "Essay, review all projects", is this a 5 page paper on the essence and details, plus the 5 page paper on reviewing other people's projects? 
2018-04-22 16:08:02	AlexPhelps	I want to make sure I understand the final assignment correctly:
2018-04-22 16:08:02		Each student will complete a 5-10 page paper in the format specified.  The content is to be a deconstruction of other groups code, extracting abstractions, commenting on implementation, suggesting improvements, and evaluating possible limitations with the groups implementation (what kind of card games couldn't be made with their code?  What is missing that would be helpful/useful?)  Due May 10th.
2018-04-22 16:08:02		Is this information correct?  Key things I want to verify are 1) content and 2) that each student (and not group) has to do a paper. [:+1:2]  (edited)
2018-04-23 09:13:00	timm	1a) content = yes. 5 pages will suffice
2018-04-23 09:13:00		1b) due date = 9am may10. late submissions will be unacceptable since we have to grade before may11.
2018-04-23 09:13:00		2) **groups**, not individuals, do the essay 
2018-04-23 09:26:23	timm	=======
2018-04-23 09:26:23		No lectures this week, I need to do project meetings
2018-04-23 09:26:23		I need to meet with each group  this week to complete my grading. So sign up now. If your team misses out, I'll just have to mark the code without your help.
2018-04-23 09:26:23		At those meetings,  I  need to see at least one (but ideally, all) members of each group  at one of the  times in the sign-up sheet shown below.
2018-04-23 09:26:23		At that meeting, I will be asking you to show me what are the  abstractions in your code that might be usable in another application domain. For example, your might have used inheritance, polymorphism, OO design patterns (such as model/view, composite, visitor, etc), nested environments, grammers, type systems,  state machines, frames, rules, pattern-driven parsing, etc, etc.
2018-04-23 09:26:23		Note that I'm not expecting you to use multiple abstractions. But I will be checking for   how well  your code uses those abstractions (e.g. some intricate and beautiful dance between a very succinct  sub-class and a much more elaborate super-class methods).

This date wasn't mentioned within the first week of classes, so it shouldn't interfere with studying for exams and final projects that were planned in the first week @patrick_xia @timm 
2018-04-23 21:33:43		@MattGray commented on @patrick_xia’s file https://plm18.slack.com/files/U8P87UNR2/FAA4QRDPG/total_plan.png (grades): Agreed with this. I and others have early exams this week, exams during exam weeks (which finish the night before this is due), and then this exam to study for two days before. The due date extension was nice because it made my short-term much better, but that due date is still very rough in regards to everything going on around it, which is a lot.  
2018-04-23 21:42:45		@gjabell commented on @patrick_xia’s file https://plm18.slack.com/files/U8P87UNR2/FAA4QRDPG/total_plan.png (grades): I agree with this too; extending the due date until right after exams doesn't really solve the issue of it taking time away from studying, which should be the sole focus of the exam period. 
2018-04-23 21:46:32	patrick_xia	Project 3 is mandatory, it worth 15 points so it's impossible to get a good grade without it (the rest mandatory part is only 85, so you need to do project 3, sorry..)
2018-04-23 21:46:32		Its due on May 10 is because Dr. Menzies wants to offer extra time to finish it. Yes it may bring some time conflicts to the exams, change due date is optional, do you guys have some ideas about this? 
2018-04-23 21:52:51	camara	Did the department head agree to this due date? I think the department head has to agree to a special circumstance in order to make a due date after April 23rd (last week of classes) 
2018-04-23 21:58:32	timm	this is some misinformation going around about this issue.
2018-04-23 21:58:32		someone has incorrectly said that  a May10 deadline is a violation of ncsu policy. 
2018-04-23 21:58:32		this is not correct
2018-04-23 21:58:32		as stated in the Policies, Regualtions and Rules, Assignments should not have a due date during the final exam period unless the assignment constitutes a part of the final exam.  now according to  https://studentservices.ncsu.edu/calendars/academic/#spring, the exam week ends May9.

2018-04-23 21:59:26	timm	at issue here is the final 5 page essay. which is a group project.  which could easily be done this week, before exams (given that lectures have now become project review). 
2018-04-23 21:59:36	timm	so good luck with your exams. 
2018-04-23 22:03:33	camara	I wonder if that is how that regulation was intended to be used :thinking_face: [:+1:2] 
2018-04-23 22:05:12	MattGray	So what I’ve been discussing with people is that, even if done now, we’d still be doing the assignment during our dead week, for many people including myself, this week is study week for initial exams and exams taking place during this week. Then if people who are studying this week can’t do it this week, we have to do it during our two finals weeks because there’s about 12 hours to do between the due date and the end of finals. Sure, it’s only 5 pages, but that’s still another significant assignment we all have on top of finals.  [:+1:2] 
2018-04-23 22:05:20	Jesse	If you believe that this assignment is ethical, just get the Dean and the Computer Science Department head to verify it. It should be easy for you if you truly believe its right. [:+1:3] 
2018-04-23 22:08:19	MattGray	Yeah, I completely agree with Christina and Jesse. It’s not during finals, but on top of studying for this class’s final, all of the work for this paper would be done during dead week and finals week, which seems to exploit the intention of the regulation.  
2018-04-23 22:11:01	gjabell	Without trying to sound too inflammatory, this does strike me as a somewhat scummy attempt to find a loophole for the no-projects-during-exam-week regulation. It seems to me that once the exam period is finished we shouldn't be expected to complete any additional assignments (in fact, this really should be the case as soon as the final exam for a class is finished, considering that it is, in fact, the final exam). Additionally (although this may be somewhat unrelated), students in residence halls are expected to move out within 24 hours of their last exam, which would suggest that the semester is considered over once you complete your last exam. Really, the only reason that there is a day in between the last exam day and the due date for grades is allow enough time for instructors to grade final exams that happen on the very last day of exams, not to be used as an additional time to turn in assignments. [:+1:3] 
2018-04-23 22:44:20	jkayani	Here's the full text of the cited regulation (https://policies.ncsu.edu/regulation/reg-02-20-14/):
2018-04-23 22:44:20		>2.  NO MAJOR TESTS IN FINAL WEEK OF CLASSES
2018-04-23 22:44:20		Lab tests and semester project reports and presentations are permissible during the final week of classes. Papers and homework may have a due date during the final week of classes only if scheduled in the syllabus.  However, in order for students to prepare for final examinations, faculty members may not assign other tests, quizzes or additional papers during the final week of classes.  Assignments should not have a due date during the final exam period unless the assignment constitutes a part of the final exam.  Exceptions to this policy must be approved in advance by the department head and the dean of the college involved.  Students should contact the appropriate instructor or department head if they believe an assignment is not in compliance with this regulation. 
2018-04-23 22:48:25	jkayani	I find it rather hard to believe that this policy was written with the intent that assignments could be due after final exam week. 
2018-04-23 22:48:25		Additionally, the requirements for this paper were reconsidered during last Tuesday's class, when someone brought up they'd already written an "Essence and Details" paper and not a "Critique everyone else's code" paper; the instructor said "Let me get back to you on that", and further clarification as requested during this past week [here, April 17](https://plm18.slack.com/archives/C8XEYFDR8/p1524005802000013), [here, April 18](https://plm18.slack.com/archives/C8MBQTZ50/p1524087668000124), and [here, April 22](https://plm18.slack.com/archives/C8MBQTZ50/p1524427682000126) wasn't given until [today, April 23](https://plm18.slack.com/archives/C8MBQTZ50/p1524489180000587). It could perhaps be argued that the assignment wasn't actually assigned until today since the class wasn't even sure whether it was a group assignment or not, nor aware of the content requirements, which as per the above regulation is forbidden. 
2018-04-23 22:48:25		TL;DR: I take issue with: a.) the ever changing and poorly communicated requirements for this paper; b.) the fact that it's due after exams, which seems rather ludicrous.
2018-04-23 22:48:25		Tadicke3: Question: For the report, does every team do one report, or does every person do their own report?
2018-04-23 22:48:25		Raymond Woods: @timm so to clarify on the "Essay, review all projects", is this a 5 page paper on the essence and details, plus the 5 page paper on reviewing other people's projects?
2018-04-23 22:48:25		Alex Phelps: I want to make sure I understand the final assignment correctly:
2018-04-23 22:48:25		Each student will complete a 5-10 page paper in the format specified.  The content is to be a deconstruction of other groups code, extracting abstractions, commenting on implementation, suggesting improvements, and evaluating possible limitations with the groups implementation (what kind of card games couldn't be made with their code?  What is missing that would be helpful/useful?)  Due May 10th.
2018-04-23 22:48:25		Is this information correct?  Key things I want to verify are 1) content and 2) that each student (and not group) has to do a paper.
2018-04-23 22:48:25		Tim Menzies: 1a) content = yes. 5 pages will suffice
2018-04-23 22:48:25		1b) due date = 9am may10. late submissions will be unacceptable since we have to grade before may11.
2018-04-23 22:48:25		2) **groups**, not individuals, do the essay 
2018-04-23 23:50:38	RaymondWoods	I don't intend to argue about the regulations or ethics because I don't understand them, but I figured as a member of allegedly the only group that did the previous essay assignment, I would say a few things:
2018-04-23 23:50:38		1. While 5 pages in the given format seems daunting, it honestly could get done in a day. Maybe it wouldn't be of proper quality, but it would be possible
2018-04-23 23:50:38		2. I do agree that changing or unclear deadlines is frustrating, but he was up front at the beginning that the class is rather experimental. Tim decided to give our group extra credit for the essay we did, which he didn't have to do at all.
2018-04-23 23:50:38		3. This third point came across as condescending so I gave up and erased it. 
2018-04-24 00:03:50	jkayani	You're right Raymond - that was generous of Dr. Menzies for giving you credit for the work your group did. However, I can't say I agree that just because the course is experimental, it can play "fast and loose" with requirements and deadlines. 
2018-04-24 00:03:50		I think it's important we hear everyone's perspective on this, and I'd like to encourage open dialogue on the matter. I hope I didn't misrepresent anyone in stating my opinion on the matter, and ask that you speak up if I did. [:+1:3]  (edited)
2018-04-24 00:56:11	ejgillia	This is a lot of moaning to get out of a 5 page paper. 5 pages of arguments have probably been written in this chat lmao 
2018-04-24 01:19:16	Jesse	I am making no argument of the assignment's difficulty and I dont think my peers are either. I am only arguing the ethics  of this assignment as well as its deadline based on the rules and regulations brought forth. These rules are not terribly specific and do not specify the definition of "exam period" (which is the root of this issue). Therefore, I want this to be a decision that is brought forth to the head of the department as well as the dean of engineering as the rules and regulations have intended. Only they have the right to determine what is and is not an "exam period", and end this debate on policies.
2018-04-24 01:19:16		Everyone's opinions thus far has been important in proving that the rules and regulations has a piece of information which has lead to multiple interprettations. [:+1:1]

2018-01-09 17:35:15		Computers are now essential in all branches of science, but most researchers are never taught the equivalent of basic lab skills for research computing. As a result, data can get lost, analyses can take much longer than necessary, and researchers are ... 
2018-01-10 15:48:05	SamuelHenderson	Just for confirmation, we are supposed to use Python 3.0 for this course? Does the version matter? 
2018-01-10 15:49:48	patrick_xia	Yes, we will use Python 3, for the actual version, I suggest to use 3.6+ for the new features 
2018-01-11 12:06:48	cmthomp7	Are there outlets for each row in the class?  
2018-01-11 14:06:18	patrick_xia	Not sure, but some of them are not working though 
2018-01-11 14:31:45	asuh	Should we download Anaconda for python 3.6? 
2018-01-11 15:23:35	patrick_xia	Yes anaconda is a good option but not mandatory 
2018-01-11 17:04:33	adbishel	Is anyone else from group C here? 
2018-01-11 17:05:31	AlexPhelps	Anaconda is great and lets you switch between Python 2 and Python 3 easily!

2018-01-12 11:58:14	riestell	Use a list comprehension to square each odd number in a list. The list is input by a sequence of comma-separated numbers.
2018-01-12 11:58:14		Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:
2018-01-12 11:58:14		1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9
2018-01-12 11:58:14		Then, the output should be:
2018-01-12 11:58:14		1,3,5,7,9 
2018-01-12 11:58:49	riestell	I am confused by question sixteen it says to square the odd numbers but the example shows odd numbers that are not squared 
2018-01-12 15:45:11	timm	Hey @riestell:  you are right. the output would should be [1,9,15,42,81]. 
2018-01-12 15:45:11		but no worries. when we look at everyone's work we will be looking more at  "can you bang the rocks together" 
2018-01-14 17:37:48	schan3	[1,9, 25, 49, 81] ? 
2018-01-14 17:38:46	jkayani	^ yeah I think that's what he meant 
2018-01-14 17:38:53	schan3	And should the output type be list? or just string. i.e. [1, 9, 25, 49, 81] or 1, 9, 25, 49, 81 
2018-01-14 18:00:21	patrick_xia	You can do either way  
2018-01-15 14:58:15	cmthomp7	should we strictly time the exercises to be completed in 90 minutes? Is it okay if not all of them are completed then 
2018-01-15 15:02:39	patrick_xia	Yes, please try to finish the entire problem set in 90 minutes, but it's OK if you can't complete all of them, this is a exercise for programming skill evaluation.

2018-03-22 16:26:41	timm	Cancelling class due to suspicious activity on campus 
2018-03-22 16:27:03	MattGray	Thank you for letting us know 
2018-03-22 17:23:53	timm	To repeat. Class is cancelled  [:white_frowning_face:4] 
2018-04-02 21:20:44	timm	Please announcement in #project regard two bonus projects 
2018-04-05 13:24:46	timm	class cancelled today. me got flu [:white_frowning_face:10 :skull:4 :scream:2 :face_with_thermometer:1] 
2018-04-10 13:32:12	timm	i had a message last week, from a  group that wanted to discuss their lsat project mark. sadly, it has gone to dev/null. please resend 
2018-04-10 13:32:25	timm	or better yet, come to office hours 2-4 in my office 
2018-04-10 16:32:42	MattGray	is there something we could google to see what the gist of the research is? 
2018-04-18 16:19:23	patrick_xia	@timm here. 
2018-04-18 16:19:23		I reviewed my notes on what is due when and what I can see is the following. If this does **NOT** correspond to your expectations, please message me. 
2018-04-18 16:19:23		Note that, by Friday, I will finalize this grade timetable and update moodle to reflect these grades for these various parts of the subject.
2018-04-18 16:19:23		Note also:
2018-04-18 16:19:23		1)  The new due dates on the final deliverables : may10. NCSU regulations forbid posting a due date on exam week so we have to push to after that time. 
2018-04-18 16:19:23		2)  The due time ins **9am** on may10 and not extensions will be possible (since subject final   grades have to be submitted to the university by May 11).
2018-04-18 16:19:23		3)  And, of course, feel free to submit earlier.

2018-04-18 17:41:08	RaymondWoods	@timm so to clarify on the "Essay, review all projects", is this a 5 page paper on the essence and details, plus the 5 page paper on reviewing other people's projects? 
2018-04-22 16:08:02	AlexPhelps	I want to make sure I understand the final assignment correctly:
2018-04-22 16:08:02		Each student will complete a 5-10 page paper in the format specified.  The content is to be a deconstruction of other groups code, extracting abstractions, commenting on implementation, suggesting improvements, and evaluating possible limitations with the groups implementation (what kind of card games couldn't be made with their code?  What is missing that would be helpful/useful?)  Due May 10th.
2018-04-22 16:08:02		Is this information correct?  Key things I want to verify are 1) content and 2) that each student (and not group) has to do a paper. [:+1:2]  (edited)
2018-04-23 09:13:00	timm	1a) content = yes. 5 pages will suffice
2018-04-23 09:13:00		1b) due date = 9am may10. late submissions will be unacceptable since we have to grade before may11.
2018-04-23 09:13:00		2) **groups**, not individuals, do the essay 
2018-04-23 09:26:23	timm	=======
2018-04-23 09:26:23		No lectures this week, I need to do project meetings
2018-04-23 09:26:23		I need to meet with each group  this week to complete my grading. So sign up now. If your team misses out, I'll just have to mark the code without your help.
2018-04-23 09:26:23		At those meetings,  I  need to see at least one (but ideally, all) members of each group  at one of the  times in the sign-up sheet shown below.
2018-04-23 09:26:23		At that meeting, I will be asking you to show me what are the  abstractions in your code that might be usable in another application domain. For example, your might have used inheritance, polymorphism, OO design patterns (such as model/view, composite, visitor, etc), nested environments, grammers, type systems,  state machines, frames, rules, pattern-driven parsing, etc, etc.
2018-04-23 09:26:23		Note that I'm not expecting you to use multiple abstractions. But I will be checking for   how well  your code uses those abstractions (e.g. some intricate and beautiful dance between a very succinct  sub-class and a much more elaborate super-class methods).

2018-04-23 11:42:02	timm	group a or group h. can i move either of you into the 16:40  thrurstime slot? i'm just hoping to get you both done in 1 hour. 
2018-04-23 11:43:22	gjabell	@timm that's fine with us, we're group A 
2018-04-23 11:44:53	timm	done 
2018-04-23 21:29:25		@camara commented on @patrick_xia’s file https://plm18.slack.com/files/U8P87UNR2/FAA4QRDPG/total_plan.png (grades): Can the Essay (Project 3) be graded as bonus credit since the university does not allow due dates within the last week or classes or later? This date wasn't mentioned within the first week of classes, so it shouldn't interfere with studying for exams and final projects that were planned in the first week @patrick_xia @timm 
2018-04-23 21:33:43		@MattGray commented on @patrick_xia’s file https://plm18.slack.com/files/U8P87UNR2/FAA4QRDPG/total_plan.png (grades): Agreed with this. I and others have early exams this week, exams during exam weeks (which finish the night before this is due), and then this exam to study for two days before. The due date extension was nice because it made my short-term much better, but that due date is still very rough in regards to everything going on around it, which is a lot.  
2018-04-23 21:42:45		@gjabell commented on @patrick_xia’s file https://plm18.slack.com/files/U8P87UNR2/FAA4QRDPG/total_plan.png (grades): I agree with this too; extending the due date until right after exams doesn't really solve the issue of it taking time away from studying, which should be the sole focus of the exam period. 
2018-04-23 21:46:32	patrick_xia	Project 3 is mandatory, it worth 15 points so it's impossible to get a good grade without it (the rest mandatory part is only 85, so you need to do project 3, sorry..)
2018-04-23 21:46:32		Its due on May 10 is because Dr. Menzies wants to offer extra time to finish it. Yes it may bring some time conflicts to the exams, change due date is optional, do you guys have some ideas about this? 
2018-04-23 21:52:51	camara	Did the department head agree to this due date? I think the department head has to agree to a special circumstance in order to make a due date after April 23rd (last week of classes) 
2018-04-23 21:58:32	timm	this is some misinformation going around about this issue.
2018-04-23 21:58:32		someone has incorrectly said that  a May10 deadline is a violation of ncsu policy. 
2018-04-23 21:58:32		this is not correct
2018-04-23 21:58:32		as stated in the Policies, Regualtions and Rules, Assignments should not have a due date during the final exam period unless the assignment constitutes a part of the final exam.  now according to  https://studentservices.ncsu.edu/calendars/academic/#spring, the exam week ends May9. 
2018-04-23 21:58:32		so there us no policy violation re May10

2018-04-23 21:59:26	timm	at issue here is the final 5 page essay. which is a group project.  which could easily be done this week, before exams (given that lectures have now become project review). 
2018-04-23 21:59:36	timm	so good luck with your exams. 
2018-04-23 22:03:33	camara	I wonder if that is how that regulation was intended to be used :thinking_face: [:+1:2] 
2018-04-23 22:05:12	MattGray	So what I’ve been discussing with people is that, even if done now, we’d still be doing the assignment during our dead week, for many people including myself, this week is study week for initial exams and exams taking place during this week. Then if people who are studying this week can’t do it this week, we have to do it during our two finals weeks because there’s about 12 hours to do between the due date and the end of finals. Sure, it’s only 5 pages, but that’s still another significant assignment we all have on top of finals.  [:+1:2] 
2018-04-23 22:05:20	Jesse	If you believe that this assignment is ethical, just get the Dean and the Computer Science Department head to verify it. It should be easy for you if you truly believe its right. [:+1:3] 
2018-04-23 22:08:19	MattGray	Yeah, I completely agree with Christina and Jesse. It’s not during finals, but on top of studying for this class’s final, all of the work for this paper would be done during dead week and finals week, which seems to exploit the intention of the regulation.  
2018-04-23 22:11:01	gjabell	Without trying to sound too inflammatory, this does strike me as a somewhat scummy attempt to find a loophole for the no-projects-during-exam-week regulation. It seems to me that once the exam period is finished we shouldn't be expected to complete any additional assignments (in fact, this really should be the case as soon as the final exam for a class is finished, considering that it is, in fact, the final exam). Additionally (although this may be somewhat unrelated), students in residence halls are expected to move out within 24 hours of their last exam, which would suggest that the semester is considered over once you complete your last exam. Really, the only reason that there is a day in between the last exam day and the due date for grades is allow enough time for instructors to grade final exams that happen on the very last day of exams, not to be used as an additional time to turn in assignments. [:+1:3] 
2018-04-23 22:44:20	jkayani	Here's the full text of the cited regulation (https://policies.ncsu.edu/regulation/reg-02-20-14/):
2018-04-23 22:44:20		>2.  NO MAJOR TESTS IN FINAL WEEK OF CLASSES
2018-04-23 22:44:20		Lab tests and semester project reports and presentations are permissible during the final week of classes. Papers and homework may have a due date during the final week of classes only if scheduled in the syllabus.  However, in order for students to prepare for final examinations, faculty members may not assign other tests, quizzes or additional papers during the final week of classes.  Assignments should not have a due date during the final exam period unless the assignment constitutes a part of the final exam.  Exceptions to this policy must be approved in advance by the department head and the dean of the college involved.  Students should contact the appropriate instructor or department head if they believe an assignment is not in compliance with this regulation. 
2018-04-23 22:48:25	jkayani	I find it rather hard to believe that this policy was written with the intent that assignments could be due after final exam week. 
2018-04-23 22:48:25		Additionally, the requirements for this paper were reconsidered during last Tuesday's class, when someone brought up they'd already written an "Essence and Details" paper and not a "Critique everyone else's code" paper; the instructor said "Let me get back to you on that", and further clarification as requested during this past week [here, April 17](https://plm18.slack.com/archives/C8XEYFDR8/p1524005802000013), [here, April 18](https://plm18.slack.com/archives/C8MBQTZ50/p1524087668000124), and [here, April 22](https://plm18.slack.com/archives/C8MBQTZ50/p1524427682000126) wasn't given until [today, April 23](https://plm18.slack.com/archives/C8MBQTZ50/p1524489180000587). It could perhaps be argued that the assignment wasn't actually assigned until today since the class wasn't even sure whether it was a group assignment or not, nor aware of the content requirements, which as per the above regulation is forbidden. 
2018-04-23 22:48:25		TL;DR: I take issue with: a.) the ever changing and poorly communicated requirements for this paper; b.) the fact that it's due after exams, which seems rather ludicrous.
2018-04-23 22:48:25		Tadicke3: Question: For the report, does every team do one report, or does every person do their own report?
2018-04-23 22:48:25		Raymond Woods: @timm so to clarify on the "Essay, review all projects", is this a 5 page paper on the essence and details, plus the 5 page paper on reviewing other people's projects?

2018-04-23 22:48:25		Tim Menzies: 1a) content = yes. 5 pages will suffice

2018-04-23 22:48:25		2) **groups**, not individuals, do the essay 
2018-04-23 23:50:38	RaymondWoods	I don't intend to argue about the regulations or ethics because I don't understand them, but I figured as a member of allegedly the only group that did the previous essay assignment, I would say a few things:
2018-04-23 23:50:38		1. While 5 pages in the given format seems daunting, it honestly could get done in a day. Maybe it wouldn't be of proper quality, but it would be possible
2018-04-23 23:50:38		2. I do agree that changing or unclear deadlines is frustrating, but he was up front at the beginning that the class is rather experimental. Tim decided to give our group extra credit for the essay we did, which he didn't have to do at all.
2018-04-23 23:50:38		3. This third point came across as condescending so I gave up and erased it. 
2018-04-24 00:03:50	jkayani	You're right Raymond - that was generous of Dr. Menzies for giving you credit for the work your group did. However, I can't say I agree that just because the course is experimental, it can play "fast and loose" with requirements and deadlines. 
2018-04-24 00:03:50		I think it's important we hear everyone's perspective on this, and I'd like to encourage open dialogue on the matter. I hope I didn't misrepresent anyone in stating my opinion on the matter, and ask that you speak up if I did. [:+1:3]  (edited)
2018-04-24 00:56:11	ejgillia	This is a lot of moaning to get out of a 5 page paper. 5 pages of arguments have probably been written in this chat lmao 
2018-04-24 01:19:16	Jesse	I am making no argument of the assignment's difficulty and I dont think my peers are either. I am only arguing the ethics  of this assignment as well as its deadline based on the rules and regulations brought forth. These rules are not terribly specific and do not specify the definition of "exam period" (which is the root of this issue). Therefore, I want this to be a decision that is brought forth to the head of the department as well as the dean of engineering as the rules and regulations have intended. Only they have the right to determine what is and is not an "exam period", and end this debate on policies.
2018-04-24 01:19:16		Everyone's opinions thus far has been important in proving that the rules and regulations has a piece of information which has lead to multiple interprettations. [:+1:1] 
2018-04-24 07:50:46	timm	The people have spoken.
2018-04-24 07:50:46		 Essay cancelled.

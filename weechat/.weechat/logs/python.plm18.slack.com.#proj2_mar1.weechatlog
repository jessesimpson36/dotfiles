2018-03-11 14:58:33	ThomasDickerson	Also, there's a Moodle submission and a github repo. Where should each thing get submitted? My current assumption is the transcripts should be on moodle, the code should be in the repo, and the readme should be on both. Let me know if this is wrong 
2018-03-11 15:36:20	patrick_xia	We need to see the output from 2 runs per game. So if you need to submit two games, you need 4 runs (if submitting one game, then 2 runs). Its up to you if you do that with video or transcript files.
2018-03-11 15:36:20		As to submission, please submit your url both on moodle and a submission sheet (will post soon), so other students can learn from each other. [:+1:2] 
2018-03-11 15:43:00	riestell	also one submission per team? or should we each submit in moodle 
2018-03-11 15:46:17	patrick_xia	@riestell One for each team is enough 
2018-03-11 15:47:09	patrick_xia	submission sheet:

2018-03-11 15:52:51	ThomasDickerson	So on the moodle locker we just submit the URL of our git repo? 
2018-03-11 15:56:21	patrick_xia	Yes, and instructions about where to find the video or transcript. [:+1:1]

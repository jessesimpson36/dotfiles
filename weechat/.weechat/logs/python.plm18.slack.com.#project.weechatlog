2018-01-24 09:33:31		Wikipedia: Bartok (card game)
2018-01-24 09:33:31		The game of Bartok, also known by a number of other names, such as Wartoke, Warthog, Bartog, Bentok, Last One Standing or Bong 98, is a card game where the winner of each round invents a new rule which must be obeyed for the remainder of the game. It belongs to the "shedding" or Crazy Eights family of card games, whereby each player tries to rid himself of all of his cards. The game progresses through a series of rounds with a new rule being added in each round, thus making the game increasingly complex as it progresses. These newly introduced rules may modify any existing rules.

2018-01-25 21:42:06		Q1) In the step0 you say to annotate two card games. Do you mean existing card games? 
2018-01-25 21:42:06		Q2) Further, in Step 1 you say make the two games from Step 1 (I'm guessing you mean step 0) English notes come alive. Are we doing games that do or don't already exist?  (edited)

2018-04-02 21:16:17	timm	I'm announcing now three changes to the project structure as described in https://github.com/txt/plm18/blob/master/doc/project.md
2018-04-02 21:16:17		#1: the following is no longer needed "Let the games begin. We all play the game and each week we "vote off" half the games."
2018-04-02 21:16:17		#2: bonus project 4a (Four bonus marks). Do 2 more card games BUT all our your four card games need to be built from the same abstraction base (i.e. all 4 games are just elaborations on some shared basic structure). We'll reopen the "this is what games I am doing" sheet so no one does the same 2 extra card games.
2018-04-02 21:16:17		#3 bonus project 4b (five bonus marks): Multiple AIs playing the game. So for a four player games, 4 AIs all in competition (or 3 AIs and 1 human). For this to work, each AI needs to have its own working memory (so all the AIs use local variables). Also, it si REQUIRED that   the AIs must compute a game tree (*) of at least depth=4 (ie. the AI must think about its own move, what the others might do, what it might do in response and what the other might do in response to its response).

2018-04-02 21:16:17	timm	I'm announcing now three changes to the project structure as described in https://github.com/txt/plm18/blob/master/doc/project.md
2018-04-02 21:16:17		#1: the following is no longer needed "Let the games begin. We all play the game and each week we "vote off" half the games."
2018-04-02 21:16:17		#2: bonus project 4a (Four bonus marks). Do 2 more card games BUT all our your four card games need to be built from the same abstraction base (i.e. all 4 games are just elaborations on some shared basic structure). We'll reopen the "this is what games I am doing" sheet so no one does the same 2 extra card games.
2018-04-02 21:16:17		#3 bonus project 4b (five bonus marks): Multiple AIs playing the game. So for a four player games, 4 AIs all in competition (or 3 AIs and 1 human). For this to work, each AI needs to have its own working memory (so all the AIs use local variables). Also, it si REQUIRED that   the AIs must compute a game tree (*) of at least depth=4 (ie. the AI must think about its own move, what the others might do, what it might do in response and what the other might do in response to its response).

2018-04-02 21:16:17		Wikipedia: Game tree
2018-04-02 21:16:17		In game theory, a game tree is a directed graph whose nodes are positions in a game and whose edges are moves. The complete game tree for a game is the game tree starting at the initial position and containing all possible moves from each position; the complete tree is the same tree as that obtained from the extensive-form game representation.
2018-04-02 21:16:17		The diagram shows the first two levels, or plies, in the game tree for tic-tac-toe. The rotations and reflections of positions are equivalent, so the first player has three choices of move: in the center, at the edge, or in the corner. The second player has two choices for the reply if the first player played in the center, otherwise five choices. And so on.
2018-04-02 21:16:17		The number of leaf nodes in the complete game tree is the number of possible different ways the game can be played. For example, the game tree for tic-tac-toe has 255,168 leaf nodes.
2018-04-02 21:16:17		Game trees are important in artificial intelligence because one way to pick the best move in a game is to search the game tree using the minimax algorithm or its variants. The game tree for tic-tac-toe is easily searchable, but the complete game trees for larger games like chess are much too large to search. Instead, a chess-playing program searches a partial game tree: typically as many plies from the current position as it can search in the time available. Except for the case of "pathological" game trees (which seem to be quite rare in practice), increasing the search depth (i.e., the number of plies searched) generally improves the chance of picking the best move.
2018-04-02 21:16:17		Two-person games can also be represented as and-or trees. For the first player to win a game, there must exist a winning move for all moves of the second player. This is represented in the and-or tree by using disjunction to represent the first player's alternative moves and using conjunction to represent all of the second player's moves.
2018-04-02 21:16:17		Introduction to Monte Carlo Tree Search - Jeff Bradberry
2018-04-02 21:16:17		The subject of game AI generally begins with so-called perfect information games. These are turn-based games where the players have no information hidden from each other and there is no element of chance in the game mechanics (such as by rolling dice or drawing cards from a shuffled deck). Tic Tac Toe, Connect 4, Checkers, Reversi, Chess, and Go are all games of this type. Because everything in this type of game is fully determined, a tree can, in theory, be constructed that contains all possible outcomes, and a value assigned corresponding to a win or a loss for one of the players. Finding the best possible play, then, is a matter of doing a search on the tree, with the method of choice at each level alternating between picking the maximum value and picking the minimum value, matching the different players' conflicting goals, as the search proceeds down the tree. This algorithm is called Minimax. The problem with Minimax, though, is that it can take an impractical amount of time to do a full search of the game tree. This is particularly true for games with a high branching factor, or high average number of available moves per turn ...

2018-04-02 21:16:17		[Notes on (Automated) Game Design](https://goo.gl/xpQcf3)
2018-04-02 21:16:17		## Goal
2018-04-02 21:16:17		In this subject you will implement a game using a domain-specific language implemented using Lopes' styles and Fowler's idioms.
2018-04-02 21:16:17		If you need behavioral attachments, you can code them us as (e.g.) S-expressions interpreted by Norvig's LISP code or (e.g.)
2018-04-02 21:16:17		some declarative and-or-not tree that queries a data base carried around as a working memory.
2018-04-02 21:16:17		However you do it, your method for configuring the game must be <b><u><i>PERFECT</i></u></b>. A language of crystal clear clarity and beauty that anyone can glance at, understand, and code.
2018-04-02 21:16:17		There is much in what follows that is under-specified. That is deliberate. Time to use your imagination.
2018-04-02 21:16:17		## Task
2018-04-02 21:16:17		Generating, prototyping, analyzing games in the space of ``what
2018-04-02 21:16:17		can be played with a group of humans + 52 standard cards and nothing else''.
2018-04-02 21:16:17		## Step0 (Feb7): Annotate two card games.
2018-04-02 21:16:17		Note: this annotation will NOT be complete, Just a place to get you thinking.
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- List what is similar, what is different. Write that down in English.  
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- Two to four pages total. 
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- Note no two teams can handle the same two games.
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- Extra points if you have an abstract description of things that are true about both games, and specialty section where you describe the specific of each game.
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- Things to think about:
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- What can a player do?
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- e.g. Play a card into a common space
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- How should the common space be structured? tree?
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- How to draw a card>
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- How to exchange a card, give or take from another player?
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- Hot to reveal information
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- How to bluff
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- What are the win conditions? Lose-close out conditions?
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- Starting states/deals/hands/piles
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- Turn structure -- ordered or turn less? Can it change during play?
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- How to make a game fun? Make it so that newbies don't die straight away, that
2018-04-02 21:16:17		skills can be learned to make you play better? Make the game not too trivial to win or lose, but not too hard.
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- etc
2018-04-02 21:16:17		# Step1 (Mar1): Executable annotations (V0.1)
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- Make your English notes from step1 come alive
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- There will be objects (players, cards)
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- There will be states (desperation, caution)
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- There will be iterators (for each turn do, for each player do,  for bad cards do...)
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- There might be closures, S-expressions, state machines,
2018-04-02 21:16:17		compartments, and other cool things we learn later in this class.
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- There will be functions (e.g. sorting cards; scoring hands).
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- Are these global?
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- Are these parts of an object?
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- You decide... you are the designer!
2018-04-02 21:16:17		## Step2 (Apr1): V1.0
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- Using feedback from Mar1, deliver a better game
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- Add an interface so that one human can jump into the game.
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- Let the games begin. 
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- We all play the game and each week we "vote off" half the games.
2018-04-02 21:16:17		## Step3 (May1): Analysis
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- Contrast the games that lived long or died early in April.
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- What language features made them more or less fun?
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- Pdf, 5-10 pages in [this format](https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template-16dec2016)
2018-04-02 21:16:17		``` 
2018-04-02 21:16:42	timm	bonus projects due may1. 
2018-04-02 21:25:22	AlexPhelps	For the AI/game tree extra credit, is that for only one game? 
2018-04-02 23:08:18	gjabell	is the report also due May1, or April13? It is listed as a requirement under both the project0 and project3 pages. Also, is the length requirement 5-10 or 10 pages? I seem to remember you mentioning that it should be 10 pages in class, but I may be mistaken.

2018-01-24 09:33:31	SamuelHenderson	The Wikipedia article on Bartok is slightly different than Dr. Marten's version - does it matter which one we use for the project? https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bartok_(card_game)
2018-01-24 09:33:31		Wikipedia: Bartok (card game)
2018-01-24 09:33:31		The game of Bartok, also known by a number of other names, such as Wartoke, Warthog, Bartog, Bentok, Last One Standing or Bong 98, is a card game where the winner of each round invents a new rule which must be obeyed for the remainder of the game. It belongs to the "shedding" or Crazy Eights family of card games, whereby each player tries to rid himself of all of his cards. The game progresses through a series of rounds with a new rule being added in each round, thus making the game increasingly complex as it progresses. These newly introduced rules may modify any existing rules. 
2018-01-24 19:04:55	schan3	I think any variant of Bartok is fine 
2018-01-25 21:42:06	timm	Matt Gray [4:41 PM]
2018-01-25 21:42:06		Could you give some clarification, my group and I aren't sure about a few things: 
2018-01-25 21:42:06		Q1) In the step0 you say to annotate two card games. Do you mean existing card games? 
2018-01-25 21:42:06		Q2) Further, in Step 1 you say make the two games from Step 1 (I'm guessing you mean step 0) English notes come alive. Are we doing games that do or don't already exist?  (edited)
2018-01-25 21:42:40	timm	A1) anything u want. one must be a Bartok variant [:+1:1] 
2018-01-25 21:44:45	timm	A2) doesn't A1 cover A2? please clarify [:+1:1] 
2018-01-30 17:05:16	cmthomp7	Wasn't it mentioned on Tuesday last week that the card annotation due date was moved back? There's something in my notes about it but i'm not sure 
2018-01-30 17:05:50	Dan.Grochmal	It was moved from the 7th to the 6th because we do not have class on the 7th [:+1:1] 
2018-02-04 12:18:07	RaymondWoods	Where are we to submit our Step 0 Paper? 
2018-02-04 12:22:42	patrick_xia	There will be a locker on moodle for submissions [:+1:1] 
2018-02-04 15:46:25	jamazzol	Is the due date for project.0 still the 6th? It is listed as the 7th on the submission locker. 
2018-02-04 18:05:24	patrick_xia	I will update that locker, please submit by 11:55 pm, Feb 6th 
2018-02-04 20:44:12	AlexPhelps	@patrick_xia My team and I did our Step0 on our GitHub Wiki.  Can we simply submit a link to it when we turn in Step0? 
2018-02-06 20:18:12	jkayani	Do all team members have to submit on Moodle, or just one of us? @patrick_xia  (edited)

2018-04-02 21:16:17		# Project : Care for a Game of Cards?
2018-04-02 21:16:17		[Notes on (Automated) Game Design](https://goo.gl/xpQcf3)
2018-04-02 21:16:17		## Goal
2018-04-02 21:16:17		In this subject you will implement a game using a domain-specific language implemented using Lopes' styles and Fowler's idioms.
2018-04-02 21:16:17		If you need behavioral attachments, you can code them us as (e.g.) S-expressions interpreted by Norvig's LISP code or (e.g.)
2018-04-02 21:16:17		some declarative and-or-not tree that queries a data base carried around as a working memory.
2018-04-02 21:16:17		However you do it, your method for configuring the game must be <b><u><i>PERFECT</i></u></b>. A language of crystal clear clarity and beauty that anyone can glance at, understand, and code.
2018-04-02 21:16:17		There is much in what follows that is under-specified. That is deliberate. Time to use your imagination.
2018-04-02 21:16:17		## Task
2018-04-02 21:16:17		Generating, prototyping, analyzing games in the space of ``what
2018-04-02 21:16:17		can be played with a group of humans + 52 standard cards and nothing else''.
2018-04-02 21:16:17		## Step0 (Feb7): Annotate two card games.
2018-04-02 21:16:17		Note: this annotation will NOT be complete, Just a place to get you thinking.
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- List what is similar, what is different. Write that down in English.  
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- Two to four pages total. 
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- Note no two teams can handle the same two games.
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- Extra points if you have an abstract description of things that are true about both games, and specialty section where you describe the specific of each game.
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- Things to think about:
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- What can a player do?
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- e.g. Play a card into a common space
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- How should the common space be structured? tree?
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- How to draw a card>
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- How to exchange a card, give or take from another player?
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- Hot to reveal information
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- How to bluff
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- What are the win conditions? Lose-close out conditions?
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- Starting states/deals/hands/piles
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- Turn structure -- ordered or turn less? Can it change during play?
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- How to make a game fun? Make it so that newbies don't die straight away, that
2018-04-02 21:16:17		skills can be learned to make you play better? Make the game not too trivial to win or lose, but not too hard.
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- etc
2018-04-02 21:16:17		# Step1 (Mar1): Executable annotations (V0.1)
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- Make your English notes from step1 come alive
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- There will be objects (players, cards)
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- There will be states (desperation, caution)
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- There will be iterators (for each turn do, for each player do,  for bad cards do...)
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- There might be closures, S-expressions, state machines,
2018-04-02 21:16:17		compartments, and other cool things we learn later in this class.
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- There will be functions (e.g. sorting cards; scoring hands).
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- Are these global?
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- Are these parts of an object?
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- You decide... you are the designer!
2018-04-02 21:16:17		## Step2 (Apr1): V1.0
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- Using feedback from Mar1, deliver a better game
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- Add an interface so that one human can jump into the game.
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- Let the games begin. 
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- We all play the game and each week we "vote off" half the games.
2018-04-02 21:16:17		## Step3 (May1): Analysis
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- Contrast the games that lived long or died early in April.
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- What language features made them more or less fun?
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- Pdf, 5-10 pages in [this format](https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template-16dec2016)

2018-01-24 09:33:31	SamuelHenderson	The Wikipedia article on Bartok is slightly different than Dr. Marten's version - does it matter which one we use for the project? https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bartok_(card_game)
2018-01-24 09:33:31		Wikipedia: Bartok (card game)
2018-01-24 09:33:31		The game of Bartok, also known by a number of other names, such as Wartoke, Warthog, Bartog, Bentok, Last One Standing or Bong 98, is a card game where the winner of each round invents a new rule which must be obeyed for the remainder of the game. It belongs to the "shedding" or Crazy Eights family of card games, whereby each player tries to rid himself of all of his cards. The game progresses through a series of rounds with a new rule being added in each round, thus making the game increasingly complex as it progresses. These newly introduced rules may modify any existing rules. 
2018-01-24 19:04:55	schan3	I think any variant of Bartok is fine 
2018-01-25 21:42:06	timm	Matt Gray [4:41 PM]
2018-01-25 21:42:06		Could you give some clarification, my group and I aren't sure about a few things: 
2018-01-25 21:42:06		Q1) In the step0 you say to annotate two card games. Do you mean existing card games? 
2018-01-25 21:42:06		Q2) Further, in Step 1 you say make the two games from Step 1 (I'm guessing you mean step 0) English notes come alive. Are we doing games that do or don't already exist?  (edited)
2018-01-25 21:42:40	timm	A1) anything u want. one must be a Bartok variant [:+1:1] 
2018-01-25 21:44:45	timm	A2) doesn't A1 cover A2? please clarify [:+1:1] 
2018-01-30 17:05:16	cmthomp7	Wasn't it mentioned on Tuesday last week that the card annotation due date was moved back? There's something in my notes about it but i'm not sure 
2018-01-30 17:05:50	Dan.Grochmal	It was moved from the 7th to the 6th because we do not have class on the 7th [:+1:1] 
2018-02-04 12:18:07	RaymondWoods	Where are we to submit our Step 0 Paper? 
2018-02-04 12:22:42	patrick_xia	There will be a locker on moodle for submissions [:+1:1] 
2018-02-04 15:46:25	jamazzol	Is the due date for project.0 still the 6th? It is listed as the 7th on the submission locker. 
2018-02-04 18:05:24	patrick_xia	I will update that locker, please submit by 11:55 pm, Feb 6th 
2018-02-04 20:44:12	AlexPhelps	@patrick_xia My team and I did our Step0 on our GitHub Wiki.  Can we simply submit a link to it when we turn in Step0? 
2018-02-06 20:18:12	jkayani	Do all team members have to submit on Moodle, or just one of us? @patrick_xia  (edited)
2018-02-06 20:55:10	gjabell	@jkayani The submission locker says one file per group, with every group member's name in it [:+1:4] 
2018-02-08 15:59:39	timm	- Some rough notes on results from step0, to be discussed in class today.     https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gJqpyruV-IyChL3isGU75QoDuWzb7YSDP2Bu4FjnPlA/edit?usp=sharing

2018-02-08 15:59:39		sandbox - some throwaway stuff that you shoudl ignore 
2018-03-08 12:18:11	MattGray	@timm for the bartok variant on the project, do you expect custom rule implementation? 
2018-03-08 12:36:14	MattGray	Also, question 2, is it okay if a game is 4 player? 
2018-03-08 13:15:12	timm	4player = ok 
2018-03-08 13:15:50	timm	for bartok ,a dna ny other game, version1, i just want a running system of any form . customized rules sound like v2 dsl stuff 
2018-03-11 15:42:03	patrick_xia	For project submission, please check #proj2_mar1 for the instructions [:100:1] 
2018-04-01 16:02:22	RaymondWoods	I believe Dr. Menzies discussed this in class, but I want to make sure I understand what the "Essence and Details" are exactly in regards to writing our paper. 
2018-04-02 21:16:17	timm	I'm announcing now three changes to the project structure as described in https://github.com/txt/plm18/blob/master/doc/project.md
2018-04-02 21:16:17		#1: the following is no longer needed "Let the games begin. We all play the game and each week we "vote off" half the games."
2018-04-02 21:16:17		#2: bonus project 4a (Four bonus marks). Do 2 more card games BUT all our your four card games need to be built from the same abstraction base (i.e. all 4 games are just elaborations on some shared basic structure). We'll reopen the "this is what games I am doing" sheet so no one does the same 2 extra card games.
2018-04-02 21:16:17		#3 bonus project 4b (five bonus marks): Multiple AIs playing the game. So for a four player games, 4 AIs all in competition (or 3 AIs and 1 human). For this to work, each AI needs to have its own working memory (so all the AIs use local variables). Also, it si REQUIRED that   the AIs must compute a game tree (*) of at least depth=4 (ie. the AI must think about its own move, what the others might do, what it might do in response and what the other might do in response to its response).

2018-04-02 21:16:17		https://goo.gl/YLarBR
2018-04-02 21:16:17		Wikipedia: Game tree
2018-04-02 21:16:17		In game theory, a game tree is a directed graph whose nodes are positions in a game and whose edges are moves. The complete game tree for a game is the game tree starting at the initial position and containing all possible moves from each position; the complete tree is the same tree as that obtained from the extensive-form game representation.
2018-04-02 21:16:17		The diagram shows the first two levels, or plies, in the game tree for tic-tac-toe. The rotations and reflections of positions are equivalent, so the first player has three choices of move: in the center, at the edge, or in the corner. The second player has two choices for the reply if the first player played in the center, otherwise five choices. And so on.
2018-04-02 21:16:17		The number of leaf nodes in the complete game tree is the number of possible different ways the game can be played. For example, the game tree for tic-tac-toe has 255,168 leaf nodes.
2018-04-02 21:16:17		Game trees are important in artificial intelligence because one way to pick the best move in a game is to search the game tree using the minimax algorithm or its variants. The game tree for tic-tac-toe is easily searchable, but the complete game trees for larger games like chess are much too large to search. Instead, a chess-playing program searches a partial game tree: typically as many plies from the current position as it can search in the time available. Except for the case of "pathological" game trees (which seem to be quite rare in practice), increasing the search depth (i.e., the number of plies searched) generally improves the chance of picking the best move.
2018-04-02 21:16:17		Two-person games can also be represented as and-or trees. For the first player to win a game, there must exist a winning move for all moves of the second player. This is represented in the and-or tree by using disjunction to represent the first player's alternative moves and using conjunction to represent all of the second player's moves.
2018-04-02 21:16:17		Introduction to Monte Carlo Tree Search - Jeff Bradberry
2018-04-02 21:16:17		The subject of game AI generally begins with so-called perfect information games. These are turn-based games where the players have no information hidden from each other and there is no element of chance in the game mechanics (such as by rolling dice or drawing cards from a shuffled deck). Tic Tac Toe, Connect 4, Checkers, Reversi, Chess, and Go are all games of this type. Because everything in this type of game is fully determined, a tree can, in theory, be constructed that contains all possible outcomes, and a value assigned corresponding to a win or a loss for one of the players. Finding the best possible play, then, is a matter of doing a search on the tree, with the method of choice at each level alternating between picking the maximum value and picking the minimum value, matching the different players' conflicting goals, as the search proceeds down the tree. This algorithm is called Minimax. The problem with Minimax, though, is that it can take an impractical amount of time to do a full search of the game tree. This is particularly true for games with a high branching factor, or high average number of available moves per turn ...

2018-04-02 21:16:17		# Step1 (Mar1): Executable annotations (V0.1)
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- Make your English notes from step1 come alive
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- There will be objects (players, cards)
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- There will be states (desperation, caution)
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- There will be iterators (for each turn do, for each player do,  for bad cards do...)
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- There might be closures, S-expressions, state machines,
2018-04-02 21:16:17		compartments, and other cool things we learn later in this class.
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- There will be functions (e.g. sorting cards; scoring hands).
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- Are these global?
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- Are these parts of an object?
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- You decide... you are the designer!

2018-04-02 21:16:17		- Add an interface so that one human can jump into the game.
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- Let the games begin. 
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- We all play the game and each week we "vote off" half the games.
2018-04-02 21:16:17		## Step3 (May1): Analysis

2018-01-24 09:33:31	SamuelHenderson	The Wikipedia article on Bartok is slightly different than Dr. Marten's version - does it matter which one we use for the project? https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bartok_(card_game)
2018-01-24 09:33:31		Wikipedia: Bartok (card game)
2018-01-24 09:33:31		The game of Bartok, also known by a number of other names, such as Wartoke, Warthog, Bartog, Bentok, Last One Standing or Bong 98, is a card game where the winner of each round invents a new rule which must be obeyed for the remainder of the game. It belongs to the "shedding" or Crazy Eights family of card games, whereby each player tries to rid himself of all of his cards. The game progresses through a series of rounds with a new rule being added in each round, thus making the game increasingly complex as it progresses. These newly introduced rules may modify any existing rules. 
2018-01-24 19:04:55	schan3	I think any variant of Bartok is fine 
2018-01-25 21:42:06	timm	Matt Gray [4:41 PM]
2018-01-25 21:42:06		Could you give some clarification, my group and I aren't sure about a few things: 
2018-01-25 21:42:06		Q1) In the step0 you say to annotate two card games. Do you mean existing card games? 
2018-01-25 21:42:06		Q2) Further, in Step 1 you say make the two games from Step 1 (I'm guessing you mean step 0) English notes come alive. Are we doing games that do or don't already exist?  (edited)
2018-01-25 21:42:40	timm	A1) anything u want. one must be a Bartok variant [:+1:1] 
2018-01-25 21:44:45	timm	A2) doesn't A1 cover A2? please clarify [:+1:1] 
2018-01-30 17:05:16	cmthomp7	Wasn't it mentioned on Tuesday last week that the card annotation due date was moved back? There's something in my notes about it but i'm not sure 
2018-01-30 17:05:50	Dan.Grochmal	It was moved from the 7th to the 6th because we do not have class on the 7th [:+1:1] 
2018-02-04 12:18:07	RaymondWoods	Where are we to submit our Step 0 Paper? 
2018-02-04 12:22:42	patrick_xia	There will be a locker on moodle for submissions [:+1:1] 
2018-02-04 15:46:25	jamazzol	Is the due date for project.0 still the 6th? It is listed as the 7th on the submission locker. 
2018-02-04 18:05:24	patrick_xia	I will update that locker, please submit by 11:55 pm, Feb 6th 
2018-02-04 20:44:12	AlexPhelps	@patrick_xia My team and I did our Step0 on our GitHub Wiki.  Can we simply submit a link to it when we turn in Step0? 
2018-02-06 20:18:12	jkayani	Do all team members have to submit on Moodle, or just one of us? @patrick_xia  (edited)

2018-03-08 12:18:11	MattGray	@timm for the bartok variant on the project, do you expect custom rule implementation? 
2018-03-08 12:36:14	MattGray	Also, question 2, is it okay if a game is 4 player? 
2018-03-08 13:15:12	timm	4player = ok 
2018-03-08 13:15:50	timm	for bartok ,a dna ny other game, version1, i just want a running system of any form . customized rules sound like v2 dsl stuff

2018-04-02 21:16:17	timm	I'm announcing now three changes to the project structure as described in https://github.com/txt/plm18/blob/master/doc/project.md
2018-04-02 21:16:17		#1: the following is no longer needed "Let the games begin. We all play the game and each week we "vote off" half the games."
2018-04-02 21:16:17		#2: bonus project 4a (Four bonus marks). Do 2 more card games BUT all our your four card games need to be built from the same abstraction base (i.e. all 4 games are just elaborations on some shared basic structure). We'll reopen the "this is what games I am doing" sheet so no one does the same 2 extra card games.
2018-04-02 21:16:17		#3 bonus project 4b (five bonus marks): Multiple AIs playing the game. So for a four player games, 4 AIs all in competition (or 3 AIs and 1 human). For this to work, each AI needs to have its own working memory (so all the AIs use local variables). Also, it si REQUIRED that   the AIs must compute a game tree (*) of at least depth=4 (ie. the AI must think about its own move, what the others might do, what it might do in response and what the other might do in response to its response).
2018-04-02 21:16:17		(*)

2018-04-02 21:16:17		https://goo.gl/YLarBR
2018-04-02 21:16:17		Wikipedia: Game tree
2018-04-02 21:16:17		In game theory, a game tree is a directed graph whose nodes are positions in a game and whose edges are moves. The complete game tree for a game is the game tree starting at the initial position and containing all possible moves from each position; the complete tree is the same tree as that obtained from the extensive-form game representation.
2018-04-02 21:16:17		The diagram shows the first two levels, or plies, in the game tree for tic-tac-toe. The rotations and reflections of positions are equivalent, so the first player has three choices of move: in the center, at the edge, or in the corner. The second player has two choices for the reply if the first player played in the center, otherwise five choices. And so on.
2018-04-02 21:16:17		The number of leaf nodes in the complete game tree is the number of possible different ways the game can be played. For example, the game tree for tic-tac-toe has 255,168 leaf nodes.
2018-04-02 21:16:17		Game trees are important in artificial intelligence because one way to pick the best move in a game is to search the game tree using the minimax algorithm or its variants. The game tree for tic-tac-toe is easily searchable, but the complete game trees for larger games like chess are much too large to search. Instead, a chess-playing program searches a partial game tree: typically as many plies from the current position as it can search in the time available. Except for the case of "pathological" game trees (which seem to be quite rare in practice), increasing the search depth (i.e., the number of plies searched) generally improves the chance of picking the best move.
2018-04-02 21:16:17		Two-person games can also be represented as and-or trees. For the first player to win a game, there must exist a winning move for all moves of the second player. This is represented in the and-or tree by using disjunction to represent the first player's alternative moves and using conjunction to represent all of the second player's moves.
2018-04-02 21:16:17		Introduction to Monte Carlo Tree Search - Jeff Bradberry
2018-04-02 21:16:17		The subject of game AI generally begins with so-called perfect information games. These are turn-based games where the players have no information hidden from each other and there is no element of chance in the game mechanics (such as by rolling dice or drawing cards from a shuffled deck). Tic Tac Toe, Connect 4, Checkers, Reversi, Chess, and Go are all games of this type. Because everything in this type of game is fully determined, a tree can, in theory, be constructed that contains all possible outcomes, and a value assigned corresponding to a win or a loss for one of the players. Finding the best possible play, then, is a matter of doing a search on the tree, with the method of choice at each level alternating between picking the maximum value and picking the minimum value, matching the different players' conflicting goals, as the search proceeds down the tree. This algorithm is called Minimax. The problem with Minimax, though, is that it can take an impractical amount of time to do a full search of the game tree. This is particularly true for games with a high branching factor, or high average number of available moves per turn ...

2018-04-02 21:16:17		# Project : Care for a Game of Cards?
2018-04-02 21:16:17		[Notes on (Automated) Game Design](https://goo.gl/xpQcf3)
2018-04-02 21:16:17		## Goal
2018-04-02 21:16:17		In this subject you will implement a game using a domain-specific language implemented using Lopes' styles and Fowler's idioms.
2018-04-02 21:16:17		If you need behavioral attachments, you can code them us as (e.g.) S-expressions interpreted by Norvig's LISP code or (e.g.)
2018-04-02 21:16:17		some declarative and-or-not tree that queries a data base carried around as a working memory.
2018-04-02 21:16:17		However you do it, your method for configuring the game must be <b><u><i>PERFECT</i></u></b>. A language of crystal clear clarity and beauty that anyone can glance at, understand, and code.
2018-04-02 21:16:17		There is much in what follows that is under-specified. That is deliberate. Time to use your imagination.
2018-04-02 21:16:17		## Task
2018-04-02 21:16:17		Generating, prototyping, analyzing games in the space of ``what
2018-04-02 21:16:17		can be played with a group of humans + 52 standard cards and nothing else''.
2018-04-02 21:16:17		## Step0 (Feb7): Annotate two card games.
2018-04-02 21:16:17		Note: this annotation will NOT be complete, Just a place to get you thinking.
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- List what is similar, what is different. Write that down in English.  
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- Two to four pages total. 
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- Note no two teams can handle the same two games.
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- Extra points if you have an abstract description of things that are true about both games, and specialty section where you describe the specific of each game.
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- Things to think about:
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- What can a player do?
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- e.g. Play a card into a common space
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- How should the common space be structured? tree?
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- How to draw a card>
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- How to exchange a card, give or take from another player?

2018-04-02 21:16:17		- How to bluff
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- What are the win conditions? Lose-close out conditions?
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- Starting states/deals/hands/piles
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- Turn structure -- ordered or turn less? Can it change during play?
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- How to make a game fun? Make it so that newbies don't die straight away, that
2018-04-02 21:16:17		skills can be learned to make you play better? Make the game not too trivial to win or lose, but not too hard.
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- etc
2018-04-02 21:16:17		# Step1 (Mar1): Executable annotations (V0.1)
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- Make your English notes from step1 come alive

2018-01-24 09:33:31	SamuelHenderson	The Wikipedia article on Bartok is slightly different than Dr. Marten's version - does it matter which one we use for the project? https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bartok_(card_game)
2018-01-24 09:33:31		Wikipedia: Bartok (card game)
2018-01-24 09:33:31		The game of Bartok, also known by a number of other names, such as Wartoke, Warthog, Bartog, Bentok, Last One Standing or Bong 98, is a card game where the winner of each round invents a new rule which must be obeyed for the remainder of the game. It belongs to the "shedding" or Crazy Eights family of card games, whereby each player tries to rid himself of all of his cards. The game progresses through a series of rounds with a new rule being added in each round, thus making the game increasingly complex as it progresses. These newly introduced rules may modify any existing rules. 
2018-01-24 19:04:55	schan3	I think any variant of Bartok is fine 
2018-01-25 21:42:06	timm	Matt Gray [4:41 PM]
2018-01-25 21:42:06		Could you give some clarification, my group and I aren't sure about a few things: 
2018-01-25 21:42:06		Q1) In the step0 you say to annotate two card games. Do you mean existing card games? 
2018-01-25 21:42:06		Q2) Further, in Step 1 you say make the two games from Step 1 (I'm guessing you mean step 0) English notes come alive. Are we doing games that do or don't already exist?  (edited)
2018-01-25 21:42:40	timm	A1) anything u want. one must be a Bartok variant [:+1:1] 
2018-01-25 21:44:45	timm	A2) doesn't A1 cover A2? please clarify [:+1:1] 
2018-01-30 17:05:16	cmthomp7	Wasn't it mentioned on Tuesday last week that the card annotation due date was moved back? There's something in my notes about it but i'm not sure 
2018-01-30 17:05:50	Dan.Grochmal	It was moved from the 7th to the 6th because we do not have class on the 7th [:+1:1]

2018-02-04 12:22:42	patrick_xia	There will be a locker on moodle for submissions [:+1:1] 
2018-02-04 15:46:25	jamazzol	Is the due date for project.0 still the 6th? It is listed as the 7th on the submission locker. 
2018-02-04 18:05:24	patrick_xia	I will update that locker, please submit by 11:55 pm, Feb 6th 
2018-02-04 20:44:12	AlexPhelps	@patrick_xia My team and I did our Step0 on our GitHub Wiki.  Can we simply submit a link to it when we turn in Step0? 
2018-02-06 20:18:12	jkayani	Do all team members have to submit on Moodle, or just one of us? @patrick_xia  (edited)

2018-03-08 12:18:11	MattGray	@timm for the bartok variant on the project, do you expect custom rule implementation? 
2018-03-08 12:36:14	MattGray	Also, question 2, is it okay if a game is 4 player? 
2018-03-08 13:15:12	timm	4player = ok

2018-04-02 21:16:17	timm	I'm announcing now three changes to the project structure as described in https://github.com/txt/plm18/blob/master/doc/project.md
2018-04-02 21:16:17		#1: the following is no longer needed "Let the games begin. We all play the game and each week we "vote off" half the games."
2018-04-02 21:16:17		#2: bonus project 4a (Four bonus marks). Do 2 more card games BUT all our your four card games need to be built from the same abstraction base (i.e. all 4 games are just elaborations on some shared basic structure). We'll reopen the "this is what games I am doing" sheet so no one does the same 2 extra card games.
2018-04-02 21:16:17		#3 bonus project 4b (five bonus marks): Multiple AIs playing the game. So for a four player games, 4 AIs all in competition (or 3 AIs and 1 human). For this to work, each AI needs to have its own working memory (so all the AIs use local variables). Also, it si REQUIRED that   the AIs must compute a game tree (*) of at least depth=4 (ie. the AI must think about its own move, what the others might do, what it might do in response and what the other might do in response to its response).

2018-04-02 21:16:17		https://goo.gl/YLarBR
2018-04-02 21:16:17		Wikipedia: Game tree
2018-04-02 21:16:17		In game theory, a game tree is a directed graph whose nodes are positions in a game and whose edges are moves. The complete game tree for a game is the game tree starting at the initial position and containing all possible moves from each position; the complete tree is the same tree as that obtained from the extensive-form game representation.
2018-04-02 21:16:17		The diagram shows the first two levels, or plies, in the game tree for tic-tac-toe. The rotations and reflections of positions are equivalent, so the first player has three choices of move: in the center, at the edge, or in the corner. The second player has two choices for the reply if the first player played in the center, otherwise five choices. And so on.
2018-04-02 21:16:17		The number of leaf nodes in the complete game tree is the number of possible different ways the game can be played. For example, the game tree for tic-tac-toe has 255,168 leaf nodes.
2018-04-02 21:16:17		Game trees are important in artificial intelligence because one way to pick the best move in a game is to search the game tree using the minimax algorithm or its variants. The game tree for tic-tac-toe is easily searchable, but the complete game trees for larger games like chess are much too large to search. Instead, a chess-playing program searches a partial game tree: typically as many plies from the current position as it can search in the time available. Except for the case of "pathological" game trees (which seem to be quite rare in practice), increasing the search depth (i.e., the number of plies searched) generally improves the chance of picking the best move.
2018-04-02 21:16:17		Two-person games can also be represented as and-or trees. For the first player to win a game, there must exist a winning move for all moves of the second player. This is represented in the and-or tree by using disjunction to represent the first player's alternative moves and using conjunction to represent all of the second player's moves.
2018-04-02 21:16:17		Introduction to Monte Carlo Tree Search - Jeff Bradberry
2018-04-02 21:16:17		The subject of game AI generally begins with so-called perfect information games. These are turn-based games where the players have no information hidden from each other and there is no element of chance in the game mechanics (such as by rolling dice or drawing cards from a shuffled deck). Tic Tac Toe, Connect 4, Checkers, Reversi, Chess, and Go are all games of this type. Because everything in this type of game is fully determined, a tree can, in theory, be constructed that contains all possible outcomes, and a value assigned corresponding to a win or a loss for one of the players. Finding the best possible play, then, is a matter of doing a search on the tree, with the method of choice at each level alternating between picking the maximum value and picking the minimum value, matching the different players' conflicting goals, as the search proceeds down the tree. This algorithm is called Minimax. The problem with Minimax, though, is that it can take an impractical amount of time to do a full search of the game tree. This is particularly true for games with a high branching factor, or high average number of available moves per turn ...

2018-04-02 21:16:17		# Project : Care for a Game of Cards?
2018-04-02 21:16:17		[Notes on (Automated) Game Design](https://goo.gl/xpQcf3)
2018-04-02 21:16:17		## Goal
2018-04-02 21:16:17		In this subject you will implement a game using a domain-specific language implemented using Lopes' styles and Fowler's idioms.
2018-04-02 21:16:17		If you need behavioral attachments, you can code them us as (e.g.) S-expressions interpreted by Norvig's LISP code or (e.g.)
2018-04-02 21:16:17		some declarative and-or-not tree that queries a data base carried around as a working memory.
2018-04-02 21:16:17		However you do it, your method for configuring the game must be <b><u><i>PERFECT</i></u></b>. A language of crystal clear clarity and beauty that anyone can glance at, understand, and code.
2018-04-02 21:16:17		There is much in what follows that is under-specified. That is deliberate. Time to use your imagination.
2018-04-02 21:16:17		## Task
2018-04-02 21:16:17		Generating, prototyping, analyzing games in the space of ``what
2018-04-02 21:16:17		can be played with a group of humans + 52 standard cards and nothing else''.
2018-04-02 21:16:17		## Step0 (Feb7): Annotate two card games.
2018-04-02 21:16:17		Note: this annotation will NOT be complete, Just a place to get you thinking.
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- List what is similar, what is different. Write that down in English.  
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- Two to four pages total. 
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- Note no two teams can handle the same two games.
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- Extra points if you have an abstract description of things that are true about both games, and specialty section where you describe the specific of each game.
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- Things to think about:
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- What can a player do?
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- e.g. Play a card into a common space
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- How should the common space be structured? tree?
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- How to draw a card>
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- How to exchange a card, give or take from another player?
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- Hot to reveal information
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- How to bluff
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- What are the win conditions? Lose-close out conditions?
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- Starting states/deals/hands/piles
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- Turn structure -- ordered or turn less? Can it change during play?
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- How to make a game fun? Make it so that newbies don't die straight away, that
2018-04-02 21:16:17		skills can be learned to make you play better? Make the game not too trivial to win or lose, but not too hard.
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- etc
2018-04-02 21:16:17		# Step1 (Mar1): Executable annotations (V0.1)
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- Make your English notes from step1 come alive
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- There will be objects (players, cards)
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- There will be states (desperation, caution)
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- There will be iterators (for each turn do, for each player do,  for bad cards do...)
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- There might be closures, S-expressions, state machines,
2018-04-02 21:16:17		compartments, and other cool things we learn later in this class.
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- There will be functions (e.g. sorting cards; scoring hands).
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- Are these global?
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- Are these parts of an object?
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- You decide... you are the designer!
2018-04-02 21:16:17		## Step2 (Apr1): V1.0
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- Using feedback from Mar1, deliver a better game
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- Add an interface so that one human can jump into the game.
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- Let the games begin. 
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- We all play the game and each week we "vote off" half the games.
2018-04-02 21:16:17		## Step3 (May1): Analysis
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- Contrast the games that lived long or died early in April.
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- What language features made them more or less fun?
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- Pdf, 5-10 pages in [this format](https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template-16dec2016)

2018-01-24 09:33:31	SamuelHenderson	The Wikipedia article on Bartok is slightly different than Dr. Marten's version - does it matter which one we use for the project? https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bartok_(card_game)
2018-01-24 09:33:31		Wikipedia: Bartok (card game)
2018-01-24 09:33:31		The game of Bartok, also known by a number of other names, such as Wartoke, Warthog, Bartog, Bentok, Last One Standing or Bong 98, is a card game where the winner of each round invents a new rule which must be obeyed for the remainder of the game. It belongs to the "shedding" or Crazy Eights family of card games, whereby each player tries to rid himself of all of his cards. The game progresses through a series of rounds with a new rule being added in each round, thus making the game increasingly complex as it progresses. These newly introduced rules may modify any existing rules. 
2018-01-24 19:04:55	schan3	I think any variant of Bartok is fine 
2018-01-25 21:42:06	timm	Matt Gray [4:41 PM]
2018-01-25 21:42:06		Could you give some clarification, my group and I aren't sure about a few things: 
2018-01-25 21:42:06		Q1) In the step0 you say to annotate two card games. Do you mean existing card games? 
2018-01-25 21:42:06		Q2) Further, in Step 1 you say make the two games from Step 1 (I'm guessing you mean step 0) English notes come alive. Are we doing games that do or don't already exist?  (edited)
2018-01-25 21:42:40	timm	A1) anything u want. one must be a Bartok variant [:+1:1] 
2018-01-25 21:44:45	timm	A2) doesn't A1 cover A2? please clarify [:+1:1] 
2018-01-30 17:05:16	cmthomp7	Wasn't it mentioned on Tuesday last week that the card annotation due date was moved back? There's something in my notes about it but i'm not sure 
2018-01-30 17:05:50	Dan.Grochmal	It was moved from the 7th to the 6th because we do not have class on the 7th [:+1:1] 
2018-02-04 12:18:07	RaymondWoods	Where are we to submit our Step 0 Paper? 
2018-02-04 12:22:42	patrick_xia	There will be a locker on moodle for submissions [:+1:1] 
2018-02-04 15:46:25	jamazzol	Is the due date for project.0 still the 6th? It is listed as the 7th on the submission locker. 
2018-02-04 18:05:24	patrick_xia	I will update that locker, please submit by 11:55 pm, Feb 6th 
2018-02-04 20:44:12	AlexPhelps	@patrick_xia My team and I did our Step0 on our GitHub Wiki.  Can we simply submit a link to it when we turn in Step0? 
2018-02-06 20:18:12	jkayani	Do all team members have to submit on Moodle, or just one of us? @patrick_xia  (edited)

2018-03-08 12:18:11	MattGray	@timm for the bartok variant on the project, do you expect custom rule implementation? 
2018-03-08 12:36:14	MattGray	Also, question 2, is it okay if a game is 4 player? 
2018-03-08 13:15:12	timm	4player = ok 
2018-03-08 13:15:50	timm	for bartok ,a dna ny other game, version1, i just want a running system of any form . customized rules sound like v2 dsl stuff

2018-04-02 21:16:17	timm	I'm announcing now three changes to the project structure as described in https://github.com/txt/plm18/blob/master/doc/project.md
2018-04-02 21:16:17		#1: the following is no longer needed "Let the games begin. We all play the game and each week we "vote off" half the games."
2018-04-02 21:16:17		#2: bonus project 4a (Four bonus marks). Do 2 more card games BUT all our your four card games need to be built from the same abstraction base (i.e. all 4 games are just elaborations on some shared basic structure). We'll reopen the "this is what games I am doing" sheet so no one does the same 2 extra card games.
2018-04-02 21:16:17		#3 bonus project 4b (five bonus marks): Multiple AIs playing the game. So for a four player games, 4 AIs all in competition (or 3 AIs and 1 human). For this to work, each AI needs to have its own working memory (so all the AIs use local variables). Also, it si REQUIRED that   the AIs must compute a game tree (*) of at least depth=4 (ie. the AI must think about its own move, what the others might do, what it might do in response and what the other might do in response to its response).
2018-04-02 21:16:17		(*)

2018-04-02 21:16:17		https://goo.gl/YLarBR
2018-04-02 21:16:17		Wikipedia: Game tree
2018-04-02 21:16:17		In game theory, a game tree is a directed graph whose nodes are positions in a game and whose edges are moves. The complete game tree for a game is the game tree starting at the initial position and containing all possible moves from each position; the complete tree is the same tree as that obtained from the extensive-form game representation.
2018-04-02 21:16:17		The diagram shows the first two levels, or plies, in the game tree for tic-tac-toe. The rotations and reflections of positions are equivalent, so the first player has three choices of move: in the center, at the edge, or in the corner. The second player has two choices for the reply if the first player played in the center, otherwise five choices. And so on.
2018-04-02 21:16:17		The number of leaf nodes in the complete game tree is the number of possible different ways the game can be played. For example, the game tree for tic-tac-toe has 255,168 leaf nodes.
2018-04-02 21:16:17		Game trees are important in artificial intelligence because one way to pick the best move in a game is to search the game tree using the minimax algorithm or its variants. The game tree for tic-tac-toe is easily searchable, but the complete game trees for larger games like chess are much too large to search. Instead, a chess-playing program searches a partial game tree: typically as many plies from the current position as it can search in the time available. Except for the case of "pathological" game trees (which seem to be quite rare in practice), increasing the search depth (i.e., the number of plies searched) generally improves the chance of picking the best move.
2018-04-02 21:16:17		Two-person games can also be represented as and-or trees. For the first player to win a game, there must exist a winning move for all moves of the second player. This is represented in the and-or tree by using disjunction to represent the first player's alternative moves and using conjunction to represent all of the second player's moves.
2018-04-02 21:16:17		Introduction to Monte Carlo Tree Search - Jeff Bradberry
2018-04-02 21:16:17		The subject of game AI generally begins with so-called perfect information games. These are turn-based games where the players have no information hidden from each other and there is no element of chance in the game mechanics (such as by rolling dice or drawing cards from a shuffled deck). Tic Tac Toe, Connect 4, Checkers, Reversi, Chess, and Go are all games of this type. Because everything in this type of game is fully determined, a tree can, in theory, be constructed that contains all possible outcomes, and a value assigned corresponding to a win or a loss for one of the players. Finding the best possible play, then, is a matter of doing a search on the tree, with the method of choice at each level alternating between picking the maximum value and picking the minimum value, matching the different players' conflicting goals, as the search proceeds down the tree. This algorithm is called Minimax. The problem with Minimax, though, is that it can take an impractical amount of time to do a full search of the game tree. This is particularly true for games with a high branching factor, or high average number of available moves per turn ...

2018-04-02 21:16:17		# Project : Care for a Game of Cards?
2018-04-02 21:16:17		[Notes on (Automated) Game Design](https://goo.gl/xpQcf3)
2018-04-02 21:16:17		## Goal
2018-04-02 21:16:17		In this subject you will implement a game using a domain-specific language implemented using Lopes' styles and Fowler's idioms.
2018-04-02 21:16:17		If you need behavioral attachments, you can code them us as (e.g.) S-expressions interpreted by Norvig's LISP code or (e.g.)
2018-04-02 21:16:17		some declarative and-or-not tree that queries a data base carried around as a working memory.
2018-04-02 21:16:17		However you do it, your method for configuring the game must be <b><u><i>PERFECT</i></u></b>. A language of crystal clear clarity and beauty that anyone can glance at, understand, and code.
2018-04-02 21:16:17		There is much in what follows that is under-specified. That is deliberate. Time to use your imagination.
2018-04-02 21:16:17		## Task
2018-04-02 21:16:17		Generating, prototyping, analyzing games in the space of ``what
2018-04-02 21:16:17		can be played with a group of humans + 52 standard cards and nothing else''.
2018-04-02 21:16:17		## Step0 (Feb7): Annotate two card games.
2018-04-02 21:16:17		Note: this annotation will NOT be complete, Just a place to get you thinking.
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- List what is similar, what is different. Write that down in English.  
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- Two to four pages total. 
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- Note no two teams can handle the same two games.
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- Extra points if you have an abstract description of things that are true about both games, and specialty section where you describe the specific of each game.
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- Things to think about:
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- What can a player do?
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- e.g. Play a card into a common space
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- How should the common space be structured? tree?
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- How to draw a card>
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- How to exchange a card, give or take from another player?
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- Hot to reveal information
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- How to bluff
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- What are the win conditions? Lose-close out conditions?
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- Starting states/deals/hands/piles
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- Turn structure -- ordered or turn less? Can it change during play?
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- How to make a game fun? Make it so that newbies don't die straight away, that
2018-04-02 21:16:17		skills can be learned to make you play better? Make the game not too trivial to win or lose, but not too hard.
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- etc
2018-04-02 21:16:17		# Step1 (Mar1): Executable annotations (V0.1)
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- Make your English notes from step1 come alive
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- There will be objects (players, cards)
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- There will be states (desperation, caution)
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- There will be iterators (for each turn do, for each player do,  for bad cards do...)
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- There might be closures, S-expressions, state machines,
2018-04-02 21:16:17		compartments, and other cool things we learn later in this class.
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- There will be functions (e.g. sorting cards; scoring hands).
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- Are these global?
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- Are these parts of an object?
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- You decide... you are the designer!
2018-04-02 21:16:17		## Step2 (Apr1): V1.0
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- Using feedback from Mar1, deliver a better game
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- Add an interface so that one human can jump into the game.
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- Let the games begin. 
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- We all play the game and each week we "vote off" half the games.
2018-04-02 21:16:17		## Step3 (May1): Analysis
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- Contrast the games that lived long or died early in April.
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- What language features made them more or less fun?
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- Pdf, 5-10 pages in [this format](https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template-16dec2016)

2018-01-24 09:33:31	SamuelHenderson	The Wikipedia article on Bartok is slightly different than Dr. Marten's version - does it matter which one we use for the project? https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bartok_(card_game)
2018-01-24 09:33:31		Wikipedia: Bartok (card game)
2018-01-24 09:33:31		The game of Bartok, also known by a number of other names, such as Wartoke, Warthog, Bartog, Bentok, Last One Standing or Bong 98, is a card game where the winner of each round invents a new rule which must be obeyed for the remainder of the game. It belongs to the "shedding" or Crazy Eights family of card games, whereby each player tries to rid himself of all of his cards. The game progresses through a series of rounds with a new rule being added in each round, thus making the game increasingly complex as it progresses. These newly introduced rules may modify any existing rules. 
2018-01-24 19:04:55	schan3	I think any variant of Bartok is fine 
2018-01-25 21:42:06	timm	Matt Gray [4:41 PM]
2018-01-25 21:42:06		Could you give some clarification, my group and I aren't sure about a few things: 
2018-01-25 21:42:06		Q1) In the step0 you say to annotate two card games. Do you mean existing card games? 
2018-01-25 21:42:06		Q2) Further, in Step 1 you say make the two games from Step 1 (I'm guessing you mean step 0) English notes come alive. Are we doing games that do or don't already exist?  (edited)
2018-01-25 21:42:40	timm	A1) anything u want. one must be a Bartok variant [:+1:1] 
2018-01-25 21:44:45	timm	A2) doesn't A1 cover A2? please clarify [:+1:1] 
2018-01-30 17:05:16	cmthomp7	Wasn't it mentioned on Tuesday last week that the card annotation due date was moved back? There's something in my notes about it but i'm not sure 
2018-01-30 17:05:50	Dan.Grochmal	It was moved from the 7th to the 6th because we do not have class on the 7th [:+1:1] 
2018-02-04 12:18:07	RaymondWoods	Where are we to submit our Step 0 Paper? 
2018-02-04 12:22:42	patrick_xia	There will be a locker on moodle for submissions [:+1:1] 
2018-02-04 15:46:25	jamazzol	Is the due date for project.0 still the 6th? It is listed as the 7th on the submission locker. 
2018-02-04 18:05:24	patrick_xia	I will update that locker, please submit by 11:55 pm, Feb 6th 
2018-02-04 20:44:12	AlexPhelps	@patrick_xia My team and I did our Step0 on our GitHub Wiki.  Can we simply submit a link to it when we turn in Step0? 
2018-02-06 20:18:12	jkayani	Do all team members have to submit on Moodle, or just one of us? @patrick_xia  (edited)

2018-04-02 21:16:17	timm	I'm announcing now three changes to the project structure as described in https://github.com/txt/plm18/blob/master/doc/project.md
2018-04-02 21:16:17		#1: the following is no longer needed "Let the games begin. We all play the game and each week we "vote off" half the games."
2018-04-02 21:16:17		#2: bonus project 4a (Four bonus marks). Do 2 more card games BUT all our your four card games need to be built from the same abstraction base (i.e. all 4 games are just elaborations on some shared basic structure). We'll reopen the "this is what games I am doing" sheet so no one does the same 2 extra card games.
2018-04-02 21:16:17		#3 bonus project 4b (five bonus marks): Multiple AIs playing the game. So for a four player games, 4 AIs all in competition (or 3 AIs and 1 human). For this to work, each AI needs to have its own working memory (so all the AIs use local variables). Also, it si REQUIRED that   the AIs must compute a game tree (*) of at least depth=4 (ie. the AI must think about its own move, what the others might do, what it might do in response and what the other might do in response to its response).
2018-04-02 21:16:17		(*)

2018-04-02 21:16:17		https://goo.gl/YLarBR
2018-04-02 21:16:17		Wikipedia: Game tree
2018-04-02 21:16:17		In game theory, a game tree is a directed graph whose nodes are positions in a game and whose edges are moves. The complete game tree for a game is the game tree starting at the initial position and containing all possible moves from each position; the complete tree is the same tree as that obtained from the extensive-form game representation.
2018-04-02 21:16:17		The diagram shows the first two levels, or plies, in the game tree for tic-tac-toe. The rotations and reflections of positions are equivalent, so the first player has three choices of move: in the center, at the edge, or in the corner. The second player has two choices for the reply if the first player played in the center, otherwise five choices. And so on.
2018-04-02 21:16:17		The number of leaf nodes in the complete game tree is the number of possible different ways the game can be played. For example, the game tree for tic-tac-toe has 255,168 leaf nodes.
2018-04-02 21:16:17		Game trees are important in artificial intelligence because one way to pick the best move in a game is to search the game tree using the minimax algorithm or its variants. The game tree for tic-tac-toe is easily searchable, but the complete game trees for larger games like chess are much too large to search. Instead, a chess-playing program searches a partial game tree: typically as many plies from the current position as it can search in the time available. Except for the case of "pathological" game trees (which seem to be quite rare in practice), increasing the search depth (i.e., the number of plies searched) generally improves the chance of picking the best move.
2018-04-02 21:16:17		Two-person games can also be represented as and-or trees. For the first player to win a game, there must exist a winning move for all moves of the second player. This is represented in the and-or tree by using disjunction to represent the first player's alternative moves and using conjunction to represent all of the second player's moves.
2018-04-02 21:16:17		Introduction to Monte Carlo Tree Search - Jeff Bradberry
2018-04-02 21:16:17		The subject of game AI generally begins with so-called perfect information games. These are turn-based games where the players have no information hidden from each other and there is no element of chance in the game mechanics (such as by rolling dice or drawing cards from a shuffled deck). Tic Tac Toe, Connect 4, Checkers, Reversi, Chess, and Go are all games of this type. Because everything in this type of game is fully determined, a tree can, in theory, be constructed that contains all possible outcomes, and a value assigned corresponding to a win or a loss for one of the players. Finding the best possible play, then, is a matter of doing a search on the tree, with the method of choice at each level alternating between picking the maximum value and picking the minimum value, matching the different players' conflicting goals, as the search proceeds down the tree. This algorithm is called Minimax. The problem with Minimax, though, is that it can take an impractical amount of time to do a full search of the game tree. This is particularly true for games with a high branching factor, or high average number of available moves per turn ...

2018-04-02 21:16:17		# Project : Care for a Game of Cards?
2018-04-02 21:16:17		[Notes on (Automated) Game Design](https://goo.gl/xpQcf3)
2018-04-02 21:16:17		## Goal
2018-04-02 21:16:17		In this subject you will implement a game using a domain-specific language implemented using Lopes' styles and Fowler's idioms.
2018-04-02 21:16:17		If you need behavioral attachments, you can code them us as (e.g.) S-expressions interpreted by Norvig's LISP code or (e.g.)
2018-04-02 21:16:17		some declarative and-or-not tree that queries a data base carried around as a working memory.
2018-04-02 21:16:17		However you do it, your method for configuring the game must be <b><u><i>PERFECT</i></u></b>. A language of crystal clear clarity and beauty that anyone can glance at, understand, and code.
2018-04-02 21:16:17		There is much in what follows that is under-specified. That is deliberate. Time to use your imagination.
2018-04-02 21:16:17		## Task
2018-04-02 21:16:17		Generating, prototyping, analyzing games in the space of ``what
2018-04-02 21:16:17		can be played with a group of humans + 52 standard cards and nothing else''.
2018-04-02 21:16:17		## Step0 (Feb7): Annotate two card games.
2018-04-02 21:16:17		Note: this annotation will NOT be complete, Just a place to get you thinking.
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- List what is similar, what is different. Write that down in English.  
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- Two to four pages total. 
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- Note no two teams can handle the same two games.
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- Extra points if you have an abstract description of things that are true about both games, and specialty section where you describe the specific of each game.
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- Things to think about:
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- What can a player do?
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- e.g. Play a card into a common space
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- How should the common space be structured? tree?
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- How to draw a card>
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- How to exchange a card, give or take from another player?
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- Hot to reveal information
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- How to bluff
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- What are the win conditions? Lose-close out conditions?
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- Starting states/deals/hands/piles
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- Turn structure -- ordered or turn less? Can it change during play?
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- How to make a game fun? Make it so that newbies don't die straight away, that
2018-04-02 21:16:17		skills can be learned to make you play better? Make the game not too trivial to win or lose, but not too hard.
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- etc
2018-04-02 21:16:17		# Step1 (Mar1): Executable annotations (V0.1)
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- Make your English notes from step1 come alive
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- There will be objects (players, cards)
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- There will be states (desperation, caution)
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- There will be iterators (for each turn do, for each player do,  for bad cards do...)
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- There might be closures, S-expressions, state machines,
2018-04-02 21:16:17		compartments, and other cool things we learn later in this class.
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- There will be functions (e.g. sorting cards; scoring hands).
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- Are these global?
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- Are these parts of an object?
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- You decide... you are the designer!
2018-04-02 21:16:17		## Step2 (Apr1): V1.0
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- Using feedback from Mar1, deliver a better game
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- Add an interface so that one human can jump into the game.
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- Let the games begin. 
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- We all play the game and each week we "vote off" half the games.
2018-04-02 21:16:17		## Step3 (May1): Analysis
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- Contrast the games that lived long or died early in April.
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- What language features made them more or less fun?
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- Pdf, 5-10 pages in [this format](https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template-16dec2016)

2018-01-23 17:35:16	ChrisMartens	MDA paper added to slide 4 
2018-01-24 09:33:31	SamuelHenderson	The Wikipedia article on Bartok is slightly different than Dr. Marten's version - does it matter which one we use for the project? https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bartok_(card_game)
2018-01-24 09:33:31		Wikipedia: Bartok (card game)
2018-01-24 09:33:31		The game of Bartok, also known by a number of other names, such as Wartoke, Warthog, Bartog, Bentok, Last One Standing or Bong 98, is a card game where the winner of each round invents a new rule which must be obeyed for the remainder of the game. It belongs to the "shedding" or Crazy Eights family of card games, whereby each player tries to rid himself of all of his cards. The game progresses through a series of rounds with a new rule being added in each round, thus making the game increasingly complex as it progresses. These newly introduced rules may modify any existing rules. 
2018-01-24 19:04:55	schan3	I think any variant of Bartok is fine 
2018-01-25 21:42:06	timm	Matt Gray [4:41 PM]
2018-01-25 21:42:06		Could you give some clarification, my group and I aren't sure about a few things: 
2018-01-25 21:42:06		Q1) In the step0 you say to annotate two card games. Do you mean existing card games? 
2018-01-25 21:42:06		Q2) Further, in Step 1 you say make the two games from Step 1 (I'm guessing you mean step 0) English notes come alive. Are we doing games that do or don't already exist?  (edited)
2018-01-25 21:42:40	timm	A1) anything u want. one must be a Bartok variant [:+1:1] 
2018-01-25 21:44:45	timm	A2) doesn't A1 cover A2? please clarify [:+1:1] 
2018-01-30 17:05:16	cmthomp7	Wasn't it mentioned on Tuesday last week that the card annotation due date was moved back? There's something in my notes about it but i'm not sure 
2018-01-30 17:05:50	Dan.Grochmal	It was moved from the 7th to the 6th because we do not have class on the 7th [:+1:1] 
2018-02-04 12:18:07	RaymondWoods	Where are we to submit our Step 0 Paper? 
2018-02-04 12:22:42	patrick_xia	There will be a locker on moodle for submissions [:+1:1] 
2018-02-04 15:46:25	jamazzol	Is the due date for project.0 still the 6th? It is listed as the 7th on the submission locker. 
2018-02-04 18:05:24	patrick_xia	I will update that locker, please submit by 11:55 pm, Feb 6th 
2018-02-04 20:44:12	AlexPhelps	@patrick_xia My team and I did our Step0 on our GitHub Wiki.  Can we simply submit a link to it when we turn in Step0? 
2018-02-06 20:18:12	jkayani	Do all team members have to submit on Moodle, or just one of us? @patrick_xia  (edited)
2018-02-06 20:55:10	gjabell	@jkayani The submission locker says one file per group, with every group member's name in it [:+1:4]

2018-03-08 12:18:11	MattGray	@timm for the bartok variant on the project, do you expect custom rule implementation? 
2018-03-08 12:36:14	MattGray	Also, question 2, is it okay if a game is 4 player? 
2018-03-08 13:15:12	timm	4player = ok 
2018-03-08 13:15:50	timm	for bartok ,a dna ny other game, version1, i just want a running system of any form . customized rules sound like v2 dsl stuff 
2018-03-11 15:42:03	patrick_xia	For project submission, please check #proj2_mar1 for the instructions [:100:1] 
2018-04-01 16:02:22	RaymondWoods	I believe Dr. Menzies discussed this in class, but I want to make sure I understand what the "Essence and Details" are exactly in regards to writing our paper. 
2018-04-02 21:16:17	timm	I'm announcing now three changes to the project structure as described in https://github.com/txt/plm18/blob/master/doc/project.md
2018-04-02 21:16:17		#1: the following is no longer needed "Let the games begin. We all play the game and each week we "vote off" half the games."
2018-04-02 21:16:17		#2: bonus project 4a (Four bonus marks). Do 2 more card games BUT all our your four card games need to be built from the same abstraction base (i.e. all 4 games are just elaborations on some shared basic structure). We'll reopen the "this is what games I am doing" sheet so no one does the same 2 extra card games.
2018-04-02 21:16:17		#3 bonus project 4b (five bonus marks): Multiple AIs playing the game. So for a four player games, 4 AIs all in competition (or 3 AIs and 1 human). For this to work, each AI needs to have its own working memory (so all the AIs use local variables). Also, it si REQUIRED that   the AIs must compute a game tree (*) of at least depth=4 (ie. the AI must think about its own move, what the others might do, what it might do in response and what the other might do in response to its response).
2018-04-02 21:16:17		(*)

2018-04-02 21:16:17		https://jeffbradberry.com/posts/2015/09/intro-to-monte-carlo-tree-search/
2018-04-02 21:16:17		https://goo.gl/YLarBR
2018-04-02 21:16:17		Wikipedia: Game tree
2018-04-02 21:16:17		In game theory, a game tree is a directed graph whose nodes are positions in a game and whose edges are moves. The complete game tree for a game is the game tree starting at the initial position and containing all possible moves from each position; the complete tree is the same tree as that obtained from the extensive-form game representation.
2018-04-02 21:16:17		The diagram shows the first two levels, or plies, in the game tree for tic-tac-toe. The rotations and reflections of positions are equivalent, so the first player has three choices of move: in the center, at the edge, or in the corner. The second player has two choices for the reply if the first player played in the center, otherwise five choices. And so on.
2018-04-02 21:16:17		The number of leaf nodes in the complete game tree is the number of possible different ways the game can be played. For example, the game tree for tic-tac-toe has 255,168 leaf nodes.
2018-04-02 21:16:17		Game trees are important in artificial intelligence because one way to pick the best move in a game is to search the game tree using the minimax algorithm or its variants. The game tree for tic-tac-toe is easily searchable, but the complete game trees for larger games like chess are much too large to search. Instead, a chess-playing program searches a partial game tree: typically as many plies from the current position as it can search in the time available. Except for the case of "pathological" game trees (which seem to be quite rare in practice), increasing the search depth (i.e., the number of plies searched) generally improves the chance of picking the best move.
2018-04-02 21:16:17		Two-person games can also be represented as and-or trees. For the first player to win a game, there must exist a winning move for all moves of the second player. This is represented in the and-or tree by using disjunction to represent the first player's alternative moves and using conjunction to represent all of the second player's moves.
2018-04-02 21:16:17		Introduction to Monte Carlo Tree Search - Jeff Bradberry
2018-04-02 21:16:17		The subject of game AI generally begins with so-called perfect information games. These are turn-based games where the players have no information hidden from each other and there is no element of chance in the game mechanics (such as by rolling dice or drawing cards from a shuffled deck). Tic Tac Toe, Connect 4, Checkers, Reversi, Chess, and Go are all games of this type. Because everything in this type of game is fully determined, a tree can, in theory, be constructed that contains all possible outcomes, and a value assigned corresponding to a win or a loss for one of the players. Finding the best possible play, then, is a matter of doing a search on the tree, with the method of choice at each level alternating between picking the maximum value and picking the minimum value, matching the different players' conflicting goals, as the search proceeds down the tree. This algorithm is called Minimax. The problem with Minimax, though, is that it can take an impractical amount of time to do a full search of the game tree. This is particularly true for games with a high branching factor, or high average number of available moves per turn ...

2018-04-02 21:16:17		# Project : Care for a Game of Cards?
2018-04-02 21:16:17		[Notes on (Automated) Game Design](https://goo.gl/xpQcf3)
2018-04-02 21:16:17		## Goal
2018-04-02 21:16:17		In this subject you will implement a game using a domain-specific language implemented using Lopes' styles and Fowler's idioms.
2018-04-02 21:16:17		If you need behavioral attachments, you can code them us as (e.g.) S-expressions interpreted by Norvig's LISP code or (e.g.)
2018-04-02 21:16:17		some declarative and-or-not tree that queries a data base carried around as a working memory.
2018-04-02 21:16:17		However you do it, your method for configuring the game must be <b><u><i>PERFECT</i></u></b>. A language of crystal clear clarity and beauty that anyone can glance at, understand, and code.
2018-04-02 21:16:17		There is much in what follows that is under-specified. That is deliberate. Time to use your imagination.
2018-04-02 21:16:17		## Task
2018-04-02 21:16:17		Generating, prototyping, analyzing games in the space of ``what
2018-04-02 21:16:17		can be played with a group of humans + 52 standard cards and nothing else''.
2018-04-02 21:16:17		## Step0 (Feb7): Annotate two card games.
2018-04-02 21:16:17		Note: this annotation will NOT be complete, Just a place to get you thinking.
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- List what is similar, what is different. Write that down in English.  
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- Two to four pages total. 
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- Note no two teams can handle the same two games.
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- Extra points if you have an abstract description of things that are true about both games, and specialty section where you describe the specific of each game.
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- Things to think about:
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- What can a player do?
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- e.g. Play a card into a common space
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- How should the common space be structured? tree?
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- How to draw a card>
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- How to exchange a card, give or take from another player?
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- Hot to reveal information
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- How to bluff
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- What are the win conditions? Lose-close out conditions?
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- Starting states/deals/hands/piles
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- Turn structure -- ordered or turn less? Can it change during play?
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- How to make a game fun? Make it so that newbies don't die straight away, that
2018-04-02 21:16:17		skills can be learned to make you play better? Make the game not too trivial to win or lose, but not too hard.
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- etc
2018-04-02 21:16:17		# Step1 (Mar1): Executable annotations (V0.1)
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- Make your English notes from step1 come alive
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- There will be objects (players, cards)
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- There will be states (desperation, caution)
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- There will be iterators (for each turn do, for each player do,  for bad cards do...)
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- There might be closures, S-expressions, state machines,
2018-04-02 21:16:17		compartments, and other cool things we learn later in this class.
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- There will be functions (e.g. sorting cards; scoring hands).
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- Are these global?
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- Are these parts of an object?
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- You decide... you are the designer!
2018-04-02 21:16:17		## Step2 (Apr1): V1.0
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- Using feedback from Mar1, deliver a better game
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- Add an interface so that one human can jump into the game.
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- Let the games begin. 
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- We all play the game and each week we "vote off" half the games.
2018-04-02 21:16:17		## Step3 (May1): Analysis
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- Contrast the games that lived long or died early in April.
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- What language features made them more or less fun?
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- Pdf, 5-10 pages in [this format](https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template-16dec2016)

2018-01-24 09:33:31		Wikipedia: Bartok (card game)
2018-01-24 09:33:31		The game of Bartok, also known by a number of other names, such as Wartoke, Warthog, Bartog, Bentok, Last One Standing or Bong 98, is a card game where the winner of each round invents a new rule which must be obeyed for the remainder of the game. It belongs to the "shedding" or Crazy Eights family of card games, whereby each player tries to rid himself of all of his cards. The game progresses through a series of rounds with a new rule being added in each round, thus making the game increasingly complex as it progresses. These newly introduced rules may modify any existing rules.

2018-01-25 21:42:06	timm	Matt Gray [4:41 PM]
2018-01-25 21:42:06		Could you give some clarification, my group and I aren't sure about a few things: 
2018-01-25 21:42:06		Q1) In the step0 you say to annotate two card games. Do you mean existing card games? 
2018-01-25 21:42:06		Q2) Further, in Step 1 you say make the two games from Step 1 (I'm guessing you mean step 0) English notes come alive. Are we doing games that do or don't already exist?  (edited)
2018-01-25 21:42:40	timm	A1) anything u want. one must be a Bartok variant [:+1:1] 
2018-01-25 21:44:45	timm	A2) doesn't A1 cover A2? please clarify [:+1:1] 
2018-01-30 17:05:16	cmthomp7	Wasn't it mentioned on Tuesday last week that the card annotation due date was moved back? There's something in my notes about it but i'm not sure 
2018-01-30 17:05:50	Dan.Grochmal	It was moved from the 7th to the 6th because we do not have class on the 7th [:+1:1]

2018-03-08 12:18:11	MattGray	@timm for the bartok variant on the project, do you expect custom rule implementation? 
2018-03-08 12:36:14	MattGray	Also, question 2, is it okay if a game is 4 player? 
2018-03-08 13:15:12	timm	4player = ok

2018-04-01 16:02:22	RaymondWoods	I believe Dr. Menzies discussed this in class, but I want to make sure I understand what the "Essence and Details" are exactly in regards to writing our paper. 
2018-04-02 21:16:17	timm	I'm announcing now three changes to the project structure as described in https://github.com/txt/plm18/blob/master/doc/project.md
2018-04-02 21:16:17		#1: the following is no longer needed "Let the games begin. We all play the game and each week we "vote off" half the games."
2018-04-02 21:16:17		#2: bonus project 4a (Four bonus marks). Do 2 more card games BUT all our your four card games need to be built from the same abstraction base (i.e. all 4 games are just elaborations on some shared basic structure). We'll reopen the "this is what games I am doing" sheet so no one does the same 2 extra card games.
2018-04-02 21:16:17		#3 bonus project 4b (five bonus marks): Multiple AIs playing the game. So for a four player games, 4 AIs all in competition (or 3 AIs and 1 human). For this to work, each AI needs to have its own working memory (so all the AIs use local variables). Also, it si REQUIRED that   the AIs must compute a game tree (*) of at least depth=4 (ie. the AI must think about its own move, what the others might do, what it might do in response and what the other might do in response to its response).
2018-04-02 21:16:17		(*)

2018-04-02 21:16:17		https://goo.gl/YLarBR
2018-04-02 21:16:17		Wikipedia: Game tree
2018-04-02 21:16:17		In game theory, a game tree is a directed graph whose nodes are positions in a game and whose edges are moves. The complete game tree for a game is the game tree starting at the initial position and containing all possible moves from each position; the complete tree is the same tree as that obtained from the extensive-form game representation.
2018-04-02 21:16:17		The diagram shows the first two levels, or plies, in the game tree for tic-tac-toe. The rotations and reflections of positions are equivalent, so the first player has three choices of move: in the center, at the edge, or in the corner. The second player has two choices for the reply if the first player played in the center, otherwise five choices. And so on.
2018-04-02 21:16:17		The number of leaf nodes in the complete game tree is the number of possible different ways the game can be played. For example, the game tree for tic-tac-toe has 255,168 leaf nodes.
2018-04-02 21:16:17		Game trees are important in artificial intelligence because one way to pick the best move in a game is to search the game tree using the minimax algorithm or its variants. The game tree for tic-tac-toe is easily searchable, but the complete game trees for larger games like chess are much too large to search. Instead, a chess-playing program searches a partial game tree: typically as many plies from the current position as it can search in the time available. Except for the case of "pathological" game trees (which seem to be quite rare in practice), increasing the search depth (i.e., the number of plies searched) generally improves the chance of picking the best move.
2018-04-02 21:16:17		Two-person games can also be represented as and-or trees. For the first player to win a game, there must exist a winning move for all moves of the second player. This is represented in the and-or tree by using disjunction to represent the first player's alternative moves and using conjunction to represent all of the second player's moves.
2018-04-02 21:16:17		Introduction to Monte Carlo Tree Search - Jeff Bradberry
2018-04-02 21:16:17		The subject of game AI generally begins with so-called perfect information games. These are turn-based games where the players have no information hidden from each other and there is no element of chance in the game mechanics (such as by rolling dice or drawing cards from a shuffled deck). Tic Tac Toe, Connect 4, Checkers, Reversi, Chess, and Go are all games of this type. Because everything in this type of game is fully determined, a tree can, in theory, be constructed that contains all possible outcomes, and a value assigned corresponding to a win or a loss for one of the players. Finding the best possible play, then, is a matter of doing a search on the tree, with the method of choice at each level alternating between picking the maximum value and picking the minimum value, matching the different players' conflicting goals, as the search proceeds down the tree. This algorithm is called Minimax. The problem with Minimax, though, is that it can take an impractical amount of time to do a full search of the game tree. This is particularly true for games with a high branching factor, or high average number of available moves per turn ...

2018-04-02 21:16:17		# Project : Care for a Game of Cards?
2018-04-02 21:16:17		[Notes on (Automated) Game Design](https://goo.gl/xpQcf3)
2018-04-02 21:16:17		## Goal
2018-04-02 21:16:17		In this subject you will implement a game using a domain-specific language implemented using Lopes' styles and Fowler's idioms.
2018-04-02 21:16:17		If you need behavioral attachments, you can code them us as (e.g.) S-expressions interpreted by Norvig's LISP code or (e.g.)
2018-04-02 21:16:17		some declarative and-or-not tree that queries a data base carried around as a working memory.
2018-04-02 21:16:17		However you do it, your method for configuring the game must be <b><u><i>PERFECT</i></u></b>. A language of crystal clear clarity and beauty that anyone can glance at, understand, and code.
2018-04-02 21:16:17		There is much in what follows that is under-specified. That is deliberate. Time to use your imagination.
2018-04-02 21:16:17		## Task
2018-04-02 21:16:17		Generating, prototyping, analyzing games in the space of ``what
2018-04-02 21:16:17		can be played with a group of humans + 52 standard cards and nothing else''.
2018-04-02 21:16:17		## Step0 (Feb7): Annotate two card games.
2018-04-02 21:16:17		Note: this annotation will NOT be complete, Just a place to get you thinking.
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- List what is similar, what is different. Write that down in English.  
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- Two to four pages total. 
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- Note no two teams can handle the same two games.
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- Extra points if you have an abstract description of things that are true about both games, and specialty section where you describe the specific of each game.
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- Things to think about:
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- What can a player do?
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- e.g. Play a card into a common space
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- How should the common space be structured? tree?
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- How to draw a card>
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- How to exchange a card, give or take from another player?
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- Hot to reveal information
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- How to bluff
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- What are the win conditions? Lose-close out conditions?
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- Starting states/deals/hands/piles
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- Turn structure -- ordered or turn less? Can it change during play?
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- How to make a game fun? Make it so that newbies don't die straight away, that
2018-04-02 21:16:17		skills can be learned to make you play better? Make the game not too trivial to win or lose, but not too hard.
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- etc
2018-04-02 21:16:17		# Step1 (Mar1): Executable annotations (V0.1)
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- Make your English notes from step1 come alive
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- There will be objects (players, cards)
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- There will be states (desperation, caution)
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- There will be iterators (for each turn do, for each player do,  for bad cards do...)
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- There might be closures, S-expressions, state machines,
2018-04-02 21:16:17		compartments, and other cool things we learn later in this class.
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- There will be functions (e.g. sorting cards; scoring hands).
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- Are these global?
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- Are these parts of an object?
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- You decide... you are the designer!
2018-04-02 21:16:17		## Step2 (Apr1): V1.0
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- Using feedback from Mar1, deliver a better game
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- Add an interface so that one human can jump into the game.
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- Let the games begin. 
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- We all play the game and each week we "vote off" half the games.
2018-04-02 21:16:17		## Step3 (May1): Analysis
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- Contrast the games that lived long or died early in April.
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- What language features made them more or less fun?
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- Pdf, 5-10 pages in [this format](https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template-16dec2016)

2018-01-24 09:33:31		Wikipedia: Bartok (card game)
2018-01-24 09:33:31		The game of Bartok, also known by a number of other names, such as Wartoke, Warthog, Bartog, Bentok, Last One Standing or Bong 98, is a card game where the winner of each round invents a new rule which must be obeyed for the remainder of the game.

2018-01-25 21:42:06	timm	Matt Gray [4:41 PM]
2018-01-25 21:42:06		Could you give some clarification, my group and I aren't sure about a few things: 
2018-01-25 21:42:06		Q1) In the step0 you say to annotate two card games. Do you mean existing card games? 
2018-01-25 21:42:06		Q2) Further, in Step 1 you say make the two games from Step 1 (I'm guessing you mean step 0) English notes come alive. Are we doing games that do or don't already exist?  (edited)
2018-01-25 21:42:40	timm	A1) anything u want. one must be a Bartok variant [:+1:1] 
2018-01-25 21:44:45	timm	A2) doesn't A1 cover A2? please clarify [:+1:1] 
2018-01-30 17:05:16	cmthomp7	Wasn't it mentioned on Tuesday last week that the card annotation due date was moved back? There's something in my notes about it but i'm not sure 
2018-01-30 17:05:50	Dan.Grochmal	It was moved from the 7th to the 6th because we do not have class on the 7th [:+1:1] 
2018-02-04 12:18:07	RaymondWoods	Where are we to submit our Step 0 Paper? 
2018-02-04 12:22:42	patrick_xia	There will be a locker on moodle for submissions [:+1:1] 
2018-02-04 15:46:25	jamazzol	Is the due date for project.0 still the 6th? It is listed as the 7th on the submission locker. 
2018-02-04 18:05:24	patrick_xia	I will update that locker, please submit by 11:55 pm, Feb 6th 
2018-02-04 20:44:12	AlexPhelps	@patrick_xia My team and I did our Step0 on our GitHub Wiki.  Can we simply submit a link to it when we turn in Step0? 
2018-02-06 20:18:12	jkayani	Do all team members have to submit on Moodle, or just one of us? @patrick_xia  (edited)
2018-02-06 20:55:10	gjabell	@jkayani The submission locker says one file per group, with every group member's name in it [:+1:4] 
2018-02-08 15:59:39	timm	- Some rough notes on results from step0, to be discussed in class today.     https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gJqpyruV-IyChL3isGU75QoDuWzb7YSDP2Bu4FjnPlA/edit?usp=sharing

2018-03-08 12:18:11	MattGray	@timm for the bartok variant on the project, do you expect custom rule implementation? 
2018-03-08 12:36:14	MattGray	Also, question 2, is it okay if a game is 4 player? 
2018-03-08 13:15:12	timm	4player = ok 
2018-03-08 13:15:50	timm	for bartok ,a dna ny other game, version1, i just want a running system of any form . customized rules sound like v2 dsl stuff 
2018-03-11 15:42:03	patrick_xia	For project submission, please check #proj2_mar1 for the instructions [:100:1] 
2018-04-01 16:02:22	RaymondWoods	I believe Dr. Menzies discussed this in class, but I want to make sure I understand what the "Essence and Details" are exactly in regards to writing our paper. 
2018-04-02 21:16:17	timm	I'm announcing now three changes to the project structure as described in https://github.com/txt/plm18/blob/master/doc/project.md
2018-04-02 21:16:17		#1: the following is no longer needed "Let the games begin. We all play the game and each week we "vote off" half the games."
2018-04-02 21:16:17		#2: bonus project 4a (Four bonus marks). Do 2 more card games BUT all our your four card games need to be built from the same abstraction base (i.e. all 4 games are just elaborations on some shared basic structure). We'll reopen the "this is what games I am doing" sheet so no one does the same 2 extra card games.
2018-04-02 21:16:17		#3 bonus project 4b (five bonus marks): Multiple AIs playing the game. So for a four player games, 4 AIs all in competition (or 3 AIs and 1 human). For this to work, each AI needs to have its own working memory (so all the AIs use local variables). Also, it si REQUIRED that   the AIs must compute a game tree (*) of at least depth=4 (ie. the AI must think about its own move, what the others might do, what it might do in response and what the other might do in response to its response).

2018-04-02 21:16:17		Wikipedia: Game tree
2018-04-02 21:16:17		In game theory, a game tree is a directed graph whose nodes are positions in a game and whose edges are moves. The complete game tree for a game is the game tree starting at the initial position and containing all possible moves from each position; the complete tree is the same tree as that obtained from the extensive-form game representation.
2018-04-02 21:16:17		The diagram shows the first two levels, or plies, in the game tree for tic-tac-toe. The rotations and reflections of positions are equivalent, so the first player has three choices of move: in the center, at the edge, or in the corner. The second player has two choices for the reply if the first player played in the center, otherwise five choices. And so on.
2018-04-02 21:16:17		The number of leaf nodes in the complete game tree is the number of possible different ways the game can be played. For example, the game tree for tic-tac-toe has 255,168 leaf nodes.
2018-04-02 21:16:17		Game trees are important in artificial intelligence because one way to pick the best move in a game is to search the game tree using the minimax algorithm or its variants. The game tree for tic-tac-toe is easily searchable, but the complete game trees for larger games like chess are much too large to search. Instead, a chess-playing program searches a partial game tree: typically as many plies from the current position as it can search in the time available. Except for the case of "pathological" game trees (which seem to be quite rare in practice), increasing the search depth (i.e., the number of plies searched) generally improves the chance of picking the best move.
2018-04-02 21:16:17		Two-person games can also be represented as and-or trees. For the first player to win a game, there must exist a winning move for all moves of the second player. This is represented in the and-or tree by using disjunction to represent the first player's alternative moves and using conjunction to represent all of the second player's moves.
2018-04-02 21:16:17		Introduction to Monte Carlo Tree Search - Jeff Bradberry
2018-04-02 21:16:17		The subject of game AI generally begins with so-called perfect information games. These are turn-based games where the players have no information hidden from each other and there is no element of chance in the game mechanics (such as by rolling dice or drawing cards from a shuffled deck). Tic Tac Toe, Connect 4, Checkers, Reversi, Chess, and Go are all games of this type. Because everything in this type of game is fully determined, a tree can, in theory, be constructed that contains all possible outcomes, and a value assigned corresponding to a win or a loss for one of the players. Finding the best possible play, then, is a matter of doing a search on the tree, with the method of choice at each level alternating between picking the maximum value and picking the minimum value, matching the different players' conflicting goals, as the search proceeds down the tree. This algorithm is called Minimax. The problem with Minimax, though, is that it can take an impractical amount of time to do a full search of the game tree. This is particularly true for games with a high branching factor, or high average number of available moves per turn ...

2018-04-02 21:16:17		# Project : Care for a Game of Cards?
2018-04-02 21:16:17		[Notes on (Automated) Game Design](https://goo.gl/xpQcf3)
2018-04-02 21:16:17		## Goal
2018-04-02 21:16:17		In this subject you will implement a game using a domain-specific language implemented using Lopes' styles and Fowler's idioms.
2018-04-02 21:16:17		If you need behavioral attachments, you can code them us as (e.g.) S-expressions interpreted by Norvig's LISP code or (e.g.)
2018-04-02 21:16:17		some declarative and-or-not tree that queries a data base carried around as a working memory.
2018-04-02 21:16:17		However you do it, your method for configuring the game must be <b><u><i>PERFECT</i></u></b>. A language of crystal clear clarity and beauty that anyone can glance at, understand, and code.
2018-04-02 21:16:17		There is much in what follows that is under-specified. That is deliberate. Time to use your imagination.
2018-04-02 21:16:17		## Task
2018-04-02 21:16:17		Generating, prototyping, analyzing games in the space of ``what
2018-04-02 21:16:17		can be played with a group of humans + 52 standard cards and nothing else''.
2018-04-02 21:16:17		## Step0 (Feb7): Annotate two card games.
2018-04-02 21:16:17		Note: this annotation will NOT be complete, Just a place to get you thinking.
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- List what is similar, what is different. Write that down in English.  
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- Two to four pages total. 
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- Note no two teams can handle the same two games.
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- Extra points if you have an abstract description of things that are true about both games, and specialty section where you describe the specific of each game.
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- Things to think about:
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- What can a player do?
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- e.g. Play a card into a common space
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- How should the common space be structured? tree?
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- How to draw a card>
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- How to exchange a card, give or take from another player?
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- Hot to reveal information
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- How to bluff
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- What are the win conditions? Lose-close out conditions?
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- Starting states/deals/hands/piles
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- Turn structure -- ordered or turn less? Can it change during play?
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- How to make a game fun? Make it so that newbies don't die straight away, that
2018-04-02 21:16:17		skills can be learned to make you play better? Make the game not too trivial to win or lose, but not too hard.
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- etc
2018-04-02 21:16:17		# Step1 (Mar1): Executable annotations (V0.1)
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- Make your English notes from step1 come alive
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- There will be objects (players, cards)
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- There will be states (desperation, caution)
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- There will be iterators (for each turn do, for each player do,  for bad cards do...)
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- There might be closures, S-expressions, state machines,
2018-04-02 21:16:17		compartments, and other cool things we learn later in this class.
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- There will be functions (e.g. sorting cards; scoring hands).
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- Are these global?
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- Are these parts of an object?
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- You decide... you are the designer!
2018-04-02 21:16:17		## Step2 (Apr1): V1.0
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- Using feedback from Mar1, deliver a better game
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- Add an interface so that one human can jump into the game.
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- Let the games begin. 
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- We all play the game and each week we "vote off" half the games.
2018-04-02 21:16:17		## Step3 (May1): Analysis
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- Contrast the games that lived long or died early in April.
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- What language features made them more or less fun?
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- Pdf, 5-10 pages in [this format](https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template-16dec2016)

2018-01-24 09:33:31		Wikipedia: Bartok (card game)
2018-01-24 09:33:31		The game of Bartok, also known by a number of other names, such as Wartoke, Warthog, Bartog, Bentok, Last One Standing or Bong 98, is a card game where the winner of each round invents a new rule which must be obeyed for the remainder of the game. It belongs to the "shedding" or Crazy Eights family of card games, whereby each player tries to rid himself of all of his cards. The game progresses through a series of rounds with a new rule being added in each round, thus making the game increasingly complex as it progresses. These newly introduced rules may modify any existing rules. 
2018-01-24 19:04:55	schan3	I think any variant of Bartok is fine 
2018-01-25 21:42:06	timm	Matt Gray [4:41 PM]
2018-01-25 21:42:06		Could you give some clarification, my group and I aren't sure about a few things: 
2018-01-25 21:42:06		Q1) In the step0 you say to annotate two card games. Do you mean existing card games? 
2018-01-25 21:42:06		Q2) Further, in Step 1 you say make the two games from Step 1 (I'm guessing you mean step 0) English notes come alive. Are we doing games that do or don't already exist?  (edited)
2018-01-25 21:42:40	timm	A1) anything u want. one must be a Bartok variant [:+1:1] 
2018-01-25 21:44:45	timm	A2) doesn't A1 cover A2? please clarify [:+1:1] 
2018-01-30 17:05:16	cmthomp7	Wasn't it mentioned on Tuesday last week that the card annotation due date was moved back? There's something in my notes about it but i'm not sure 
2018-01-30 17:05:50	Dan.Grochmal	It was moved from the 7th to the 6th because we do not have class on the 7th [:+1:1]

2018-02-04 12:22:42	patrick_xia	There will be a locker on moodle for submissions [:+1:1] 
2018-02-04 15:46:25	jamazzol	Is the due date for project.0 still the 6th? It is listed as the 7th on the submission locker. 
2018-02-04 18:05:24	patrick_xia	I will update that locker, please submit by 11:55 pm, Feb 6th 
2018-02-04 20:44:12	AlexPhelps	@patrick_xia My team and I did our Step0 on our GitHub Wiki.  Can we simply submit a link to it when we turn in Step0? 
2018-02-06 20:18:12	jkayani	Do all team members have to submit on Moodle, or just one of us? @patrick_xia  (edited)
2018-02-06 20:55:10	gjabell	@jkayani The submission locker says one file per group, with every group member's name in it [:+1:4]

2018-03-08 12:18:11	MattGray	@timm for the bartok variant on the project, do you expect custom rule implementation? 
2018-03-08 12:36:14	MattGray	Also, question 2, is it okay if a game is 4 player? 
2018-03-08 13:15:12	timm	4player = ok 
2018-03-08 13:15:50	timm	for bartok ,a dna ny other game, version1, i just want a running system of any form . customized rules sound like v2 dsl stuff 
2018-03-11 15:42:03	patrick_xia	For project submission, please check #proj2_mar1 for the instructions [:100:1] 
2018-04-01 16:02:22	RaymondWoods	I believe Dr. Menzies discussed this in class, but I want to make sure I understand what the "Essence and Details" are exactly in regards to writing our paper. 
2018-04-02 21:16:17	timm	I'm announcing now three changes to the project structure as described in https://github.com/txt/plm18/blob/master/doc/project.md
2018-04-02 21:16:17		#1: the following is no longer needed "Let the games begin. We all play the game and each week we "vote off" half the games."
2018-04-02 21:16:17		#2: bonus project 4a (Four bonus marks). Do 2 more card games BUT all our your four card games need to be built from the same abstraction base (i.e. all 4 games are just elaborations on some shared basic structure). We'll reopen the "this is what games I am doing" sheet so no one does the same 2 extra card games.
2018-04-02 21:16:17		#3 bonus project 4b (five bonus marks): Multiple AIs playing the game. So for a four player games, 4 AIs all in competition (or 3 AIs and 1 human). For this to work, each AI needs to have its own working memory (so all the AIs use local variables). Also, it si REQUIRED that   the AIs must compute a game tree (*) of at least depth=4 (ie. the AI must think about its own move, what the others might do, what it might do in response and what the other might do in response to its response).

2018-04-02 21:16:17		Wikipedia: Game tree
2018-04-02 21:16:17		In game theory, a game tree is a directed graph whose nodes are positions in a game and whose edges are moves. The complete game tree for a game is the game tree starting at the initial position and containing all possible moves from each position; the complete tree is the same tree as that obtained from the extensive-form game representation.
2018-04-02 21:16:17		The diagram shows the first two levels, or plies, in the game tree for tic-tac-toe. The rotations and reflections of positions are equivalent, so the first player has three choices of move: in the center, at the edge, or in the corner. The second player has two choices for the reply if the first player played in the center, otherwise five choices. And so on.
2018-04-02 21:16:17		The number of leaf nodes in the complete game tree is the number of possible different ways the game can be played. For example, the game tree for tic-tac-toe has 255,168 leaf nodes.
2018-04-02 21:16:17		Game trees are important in artificial intelligence because one way to pick the best move in a game is to search the game tree using the minimax algorithm or its variants. The game tree for tic-tac-toe is easily searchable, but the complete game trees for larger games like chess are much too large to search. Instead, a chess-playing program searches a partial game tree: typically as many plies from the current position as it can search in the time available. Except for the case of "pathological" game trees (which seem to be quite rare in practice), increasing the search depth (i.e., the number of plies searched) generally improves the chance of picking the best move.
2018-04-02 21:16:17		Two-person games can also be represented as and-or trees. For the first player to win a game, there must exist a winning move for all moves of the second player. This is represented in the and-or tree by using disjunction to represent the first player's alternative moves and using conjunction to represent all of the second player's moves.
2018-04-02 21:16:17		Introduction to Monte Carlo Tree Search - Jeff Bradberry
2018-04-02 21:16:17		The subject of game AI generally begins with so-called perfect information games. These are turn-based games where the players have no information hidden from each other and there is no element of chance in the game mechanics (such as by rolling dice or drawing cards from a shuffled deck). Tic Tac Toe, Connect 4, Checkers, Reversi, Chess, and Go are all games of this type. Because everything in this type of game is fully determined, a tree can, in theory, be constructed that contains all possible outcomes, and a value assigned corresponding to a win or a loss for one of the players. Finding the best possible play, then, is a matter of doing a search on the tree, with the method of choice at each level alternating between picking the maximum value and picking the minimum value, matching the different players' conflicting goals, as the search proceeds down the tree. This algorithm is called Minimax. The problem with Minimax, though, is that it can take an impractical amount of time to do a full search of the game tree. This is particularly true for games with a high branching factor, or high average number of available moves per turn ...

2018-04-02 21:16:17		# Project : Care for a Game of Cards?
2018-04-02 21:16:17		[Notes on (Automated) Game Design](https://goo.gl/xpQcf3)
2018-04-02 21:16:17		## Goal
2018-04-02 21:16:17		In this subject you will implement a game using a domain-specific language implemented using Lopes' styles and Fowler's idioms.
2018-04-02 21:16:17		If you need behavioral attachments, you can code them us as (e.g.) S-expressions interpreted by Norvig's LISP code or (e.g.)
2018-04-02 21:16:17		some declarative and-or-not tree that queries a data base carried around as a working memory.
2018-04-02 21:16:17		However you do it, your method for configuring the game must be <b><u><i>PERFECT</i></u></b>. A language of crystal clear clarity and beauty that anyone can glance at, understand, and code.
2018-04-02 21:16:17		There is much in what follows that is under-specified. That is deliberate. Time to use your imagination.
2018-04-02 21:16:17		## Task
2018-04-02 21:16:17		Generating, prototyping, analyzing games in the space of ``what
2018-04-02 21:16:17		can be played with a group of humans + 52 standard cards and nothing else''.
2018-04-02 21:16:17		## Step0 (Feb7): Annotate two card games.
2018-04-02 21:16:17		Note: this annotation will NOT be complete, Just a place to get you thinking.
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- List what is similar, what is different. Write that down in English.  
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- Two to four pages total. 
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- Note no two teams can handle the same two games.
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- Extra points if you have an abstract description of things that are true about both games, and specialty section where you describe the specific of each game.
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- Things to think about:
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- What can a player do?
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- e.g. Play a card into a common space
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- How should the common space be structured? tree?
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- How to draw a card>
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- How to exchange a card, give or take from another player?
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- Hot to reveal information
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- How to bluff
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- What are the win conditions? Lose-close out conditions?
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- Starting states/deals/hands/piles
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- Turn structure -- ordered or turn less? Can it change during play?
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- How to make a game fun? Make it so that newbies don't die straight away, that
2018-04-02 21:16:17		skills can be learned to make you play better? Make the game not too trivial to win or lose, but not too hard.
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- etc
2018-04-02 21:16:17		# Step1 (Mar1): Executable annotations (V0.1)
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- Make your English notes from step1 come alive
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- There will be objects (players, cards)
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- There will be states (desperation, caution)
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- There will be iterators (for each turn do, for each player do,  for bad cards do...)
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- There might be closures, S-expressions, state machines,
2018-04-02 21:16:17		compartments, and other cool things we learn later in this class.
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- There will be functions (e.g. sorting cards; scoring hands).
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- Are these global?
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- Are these parts of an object?
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- You decide... you are the designer!
2018-04-02 21:16:17		## Step2 (Apr1): V1.0
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- Using feedback from Mar1, deliver a better game
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- Add an interface so that one human can jump into the game.
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- Let the games begin. 
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- We all play the game and each week we "vote off" half the games.
2018-04-02 21:16:17		## Step3 (May1): Analysis
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- Contrast the games that lived long or died early in April.
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- What language features made them more or less fun?
2018-04-02 21:16:17		- Pdf, 5-10 pages in [this format](https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template-16dec2016)

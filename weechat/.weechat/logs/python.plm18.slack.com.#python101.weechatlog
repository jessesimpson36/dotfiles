2018-01-25 17:44:58		For learning Python, I highly recommend this website.  You will need an account (free) but it has interactive tutorials all in browser.  It's pretty great, and offers step by step teaching.  It teaches through Python 2, however, so you will note some things will be slightly different between those lessons and Python 3.  The main differences in the lessons (if I remember correctly) are:
2018-01-25 17:44:58		- range function
2018-01-25 17:44:58		- printing (print is a function in Python 3)
2018-01-25 17:44:58		- rawinput() became input() in Python 3
2018-01-25 17:44:58		I used this to learn Python a few summers ago for work and was very pleased with how straightforward it was.
2018-01-25 17:44:58		Learn Python
2018-01-25 17:44:58		Codecademy is the easiest way to learn how to code. It's interactive, fun, and you can do it with your friends. [:+1:1]

2018-01-25 19:44:29		This one teaches python 3.  All 5 of the python courses with homework submissions are free for a week, after that you can just audit (just watching videos) the courses for free. They are super easy and the teacher is adorable. Play it 2x speed though.

2018-01-25 19:44:29		Python for Everybody from University of Michigan. This Specialization builds on the success of the Python for Everybody course and will introduce fundamental programming concepts including data structures, networked application program ... [:+1:1] 
2018-01-26 09:59:07	ejgillia	If you already know another language (which we all do) a full course is probably overkill. This is a very concise reference of 70% of the functionality you will need https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/python3/ [:+1:3]

2018-02-06 16:35:22	adbishel	In class the other day you mentioned special functions that began with a dunder such as the `__iadd(i, x)` function in the last homework. What were these called and why are they special again?

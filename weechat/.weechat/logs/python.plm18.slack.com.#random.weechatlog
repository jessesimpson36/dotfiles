2018-01-09 17:16:57		Wikipedia: APL (programming language)
2018-01-09 17:16:57		APL (named after the book A Programming Language) is a programming language developed in the 1960s by Kenneth E. Iverson. Its central datatype is the multidimensional array. It uses a large range of special graphic symbols to represent most functions and operators, leading to very concise code. It has been an important influence on the development of concept modeling, spreadsheets, functional programming, and computer math packages. It has also inspired several other programming languages. It is still used today for certain applications.

2018-01-12 11:48:25		https://medium.com/@preethikasireddy/why-im-leaving-silicon-valley-72919edb3297
2018-01-12 11:48:25		Thanks to the freedoms of the developer lifestyle, I started to travel more and meet engineers from all around the world???Paris, London, India, Vienna, Australia, Berlin, Tel Aviv, South Africa, Argentina, South Korea???and I started to see that Silicon Valley wasn?t the only place where world-changing engineering, technology, and innovation was happening. What I once thought was only something I could find in Silicon Valley, was starting to appear in every city I visited. Early seeds of technology and innovation were being planted in places like New York, Los Angeles, Toronto, Berlin, Tel Aviv, India, Switzerland and even South Africa.
2018-01-12 11:48:25		....
2018-01-12 11:48:25		Despite it being the center of tech and innovation for decades, I?m not the only engineer to notice a degree of homogeny in Silicon Valley culture lately. What made it homogenous was that everyone seemed to have a similar story???whether they were software engineers, product managers, venture capitalists or entrepreneurs. The career paths and goals may have been different from what my home town in New Jersey offered? but within the Valley, you?d hear the same stories over and over. Every coffee shop I went to or restaurant I ate at, I?d overhear people talking about their $20M rounds, $200M exits or their 200% YoY growth. What was once a beautiful thing???the like-mindedness???was no longer beautiful to me. I started to notice a lot of similar thinking???group think as they call it.
2018-01-12 11:48:25		Silicon Valley is paradoxically a predictable place founded on the idea of being unpredictable.

2018-01-12 11:48:25		https://medium.com/@preethikasireddy/why-im-leaving-silicon-valley-72919edb3297
2018-01-12 11:48:25		Thanks to the freedoms of the developer lifestyle, I started to travel more and meet engineers from all around the world???Paris, London, India, Vienna, Australia, Berlin, Tel Aviv, South Africa, Argentina, South Korea???and I started to see that Silicon Valley wasn?t the only place where world-changing engineering, technology, and innovation was happening. What I once thought was only something I could find in Silicon Valley, was starting to appear in every city I visited. Early seeds of technology and innovation were being planted in places like New York, Los Angeles, Toronto, Berlin, Tel Aviv, India, Switzerland and even South Africa.
2018-01-12 11:48:25		....
2018-01-12 11:48:25		Despite it being the center of tech and innovation for decades, I?m not the only engineer to notice a degree of homogeny in Silicon Valley culture lately. What made it homogenous was that everyone seemed to have a similar story???whether they were software engineers, product managers, venture capitalists or entrepreneurs. The career paths and goals may have been different from what my home town in New Jersey offered? but within the Valley, you?d hear the same stories over and over. Every coffee shop I went to or restaurant I ate at, I?d overhear people talking about their $20M rounds, $200M exits or their 200% YoY growth. What was once a beautiful thing???the like-mindedness???was no longer beautiful to me. I started to notice a lot of similar thinking???group think as they call it.
2018-01-12 11:48:25		Silicon Valley is paradoxically a predictable place founded on the idea of being unpredictable.

The career paths and goals may have been different from what my home town in New Jersey offered? but within the Valley, you?d hear the same stories over and over. Every coffee shop I went to or restaurant I ate at, I?d overhear people talking about their $20M rounds, $200M exits or their 200% YoY growth. What was once a beautiful thing???the like-mindedness???was no longer beautiful to me. I started to notice a lot of similar thinking???group think as they call it.

2018-01-09 17:16:57		APL (named after the book A Programming Language) is a programming language developed in the 1960s by Kenneth E. Iverson. Its central datatype is the multidimensional array. It uses a large range of special graphic symbols to represent most functions and operators, leading to very concise code. It has been an important influence on the development of concept modeling, spreadsheets, functional programming, and computer math packages. It has also inspired several other programming languages. It is still used today for certain applications.

2018-01-12 11:48:25		Thanks to the freedoms of the developer lifestyle, I started to travel more and meet engineers from all around the world???Paris, London, India, Vienna, Australia, Berlin, Tel Aviv, South Africa, Argentina, South Korea???and I started to see that Silicon Valley wasn?t the only place where world-changing engineering, technology, and innovation was happening. What I once thought was only something I could find in Silicon Valley, was starting to appear in every city I visited. Early seeds of technology and innovation were being planted in places like New York, Los Angeles, Toronto, Berlin, Tel Aviv, India, Switzerland and even South Africa.
2018-01-12 11:48:25		....
2018-01-12 11:48:25		Despite it being the center of tech and innovation for decades, I?m not the only engineer to notice a degree of homogeny in Silicon Valley culture lately. What made it homogenous was that everyone seemed to have a similar story???whether they were software engineers, product managers, venture capitalists or entrepreneurs. The career paths and goals may have been different from what my home town in New Jersey offered? but within the Valley, you?d hear the same stories over and over. Every coffee shop I went to or restaurant I ate at, I?d overhear people talking about their $20M rounds, $200M exits or their 200% YoY growth. What was once a beautiful thing???the like-mindedness???was no longer beautiful to me. I started to notice a lot of similar thinking???group think as they call it.

2018-01-09 17:16:57		APL (named after the book A Programming Language) is a programming language developed in the 1960s by Kenneth E. Iverson. Its central datatype is the multidimensional array. It uses a large range of special graphic symbols to represent most functions and operators, leading to very concise code. It has been an important influence on the development of concept modeling, spreadsheets, functional programming, and computer math packages. It has also inspired several other programming languages. It is still used today for certain applications.

2018-01-12 11:48:25		https://medium.com/@preethikasireddy/why-im-leaving-silicon-valley-72919edb3297
2018-01-12 11:48:25		Thanks to the freedoms of the developer lifestyle, I started to travel more and meet engineers from all around the world???Paris, London, India, Vienna, Australia, Berlin, Tel Aviv, South Africa, Argentina, South Korea???and I started to see that Silicon Valley wasn?t the only place where world-changing engineering, technology, and innovation was happening. What I once thought was only something I could find in Silicon Valley, was starting to appear in every city I visited. Early seeds of technology and innovation were being planted in places like New York, Los Angeles, Toronto, Berlin, Tel Aviv, India, Switzerland and even South Africa.
2018-01-12 11:48:25		....
2018-01-12 11:48:25		Despite it being the center of tech and innovation for decades, I?m not the only engineer to notice a degree of homogeny in Silicon Valley culture lately. What made it homogenous was that everyone seemed to have a similar story???whether they were software engineers, product managers, venture capitalists or entrepreneurs. The career paths and goals may have been different from what my home town in New Jersey offered? but within the Valley, you?d hear the same stories over and over. Every coffee shop I went to or restaurant I ate at, I?d overhear people talking about their $20M rounds, $200M exits or their 200% YoY growth. What was once a beautiful thing???the like-mindedness???was no longer beautiful to me. I started to notice a lot of similar thinking???group think as they call it.
2018-01-12 11:48:25		Silicon Valley is paradoxically a predictable place founded on the idea of being unpredictable.
2018-01-12 11:48:25		Why I?m leaving Silicon Valley ? Preethi Kasireddy ? Medium
2018-01-12 11:48:25		Here?s something I never thought I?d say: this is my last week in Silicon Valley.

2018-01-09 17:16:57		Wikipedia: APL (programming language)
2018-01-09 17:16:57		APL (named after the book A Programming Language) is a programming language developed in the 1960s by Kenneth E. Iverson. Its central datatype is the multidimensional array. It uses a large range of special graphic symbols to represent most functions and operators, leading to very concise code. It has been an important influence on the development of concept modeling, spreadsheets, functional programming, and computer math packages. It has also inspired several other programming languages. It is still used today for certain applications.

2018-01-12 11:48:25		https://medium.com/@preethikasireddy/why-im-leaving-silicon-valley-72919edb3297
2018-01-12 11:48:25		Thanks to the freedoms of the developer lifestyle, I started to travel more and meet engineers from all around the world???Paris, London, India, Vienna, Australia, Berlin, Tel Aviv, South Africa, Argentina, South Korea???and I started to see that Silicon Valley wasn?t the only place where world-changing engineering, technology, and innovation was happening. What I once thought was only something I could find in Silicon Valley, was starting to appear in every city I visited. Early seeds of technology and innovation were being planted in places like New York, Los Angeles, Toronto, Berlin, Tel Aviv, India, Switzerland and even South Africa.
2018-01-12 11:48:25		....
2018-01-12 11:48:25		Despite it being the center of tech and innovation for decades, I?m not the only engineer to notice a degree of homogeny in Silicon Valley culture lately. What made it homogenous was that everyone seemed to have a similar story???whether they were software engineers, product managers, venture capitalists or entrepreneurs. The career paths and goals may have been different from what my home town in New Jersey offered? but within the Valley, you?d hear the same stories over and over. Every coffee shop I went to or restaurant I ate at, I?d overhear people talking about their $20M rounds, $200M exits or their 200% YoY growth. What was once a beautiful thing???the like-mindedness???was no longer beautiful to me. I started to notice a lot of similar thinking???group think as they call it.
2018-01-12 11:48:25		Silicon Valley is paradoxically a predictable place founded on the idea of being unpredictable.
2018-01-12 11:48:25		Why I?m leaving Silicon Valley ? Preethi Kasireddy ? Medium
2018-01-12 11:48:25		Here?s something I never thought I?d say: this is my last week in Silicon Valley.

2018-01-09 17:16:57		Wikipedia: APL (programming language)
2018-01-09 17:16:57		APL (named after the book A Programming Language) is a programming language developed in the 1960s by Kenneth E. Iverson. Its central datatype is the multidimensional array. It uses a large range of special graphic symbols to represent most functions and operators, leading to very concise code. It has been an important influence on the development of concept modeling, spreadsheets, functional programming, and computer math packages. It has also inspired several other programming languages. It is still used today for certain applications.

2018-01-12 11:48:25		https://medium.com/@preethikasireddy/why-im-leaving-silicon-valley-72919edb3297
2018-01-12 11:48:25		Thanks to the freedoms of the developer lifestyle, I started to travel more and meet engineers from all around the world???Paris, London, India, Vienna, Australia, Berlin, Tel Aviv, South Africa, Argentina, South Korea???and I started to see that Silicon Valley wasn?t the only place where world-changing engineering, technology, and innovation was happening. What I once thought was only something I could find in Silicon Valley, was starting to appear in every city I visited. Early seeds of technology and innovation were being planted in places like New York, Los Angeles, Toronto, Berlin, Tel Aviv, India, Switzerland and even South Africa.
2018-01-12 11:48:25		....
2018-01-12 11:48:25		Despite it being the center of tech and innovation for decades, I?m not the only engineer to notice a degree of homogeny in Silicon Valley culture lately. What made it homogenous was that everyone seemed to have a similar story???whether they were software engineers, product managers, venture capitalists or entrepreneurs. The career paths and goals may have been different from what my home town in New Jersey offered? but within the Valley, you?d hear the same stories over and over. Every coffee shop I went to or restaurant I ate at, I?d overhear people talking about their $20M rounds, $200M exits or their 200% YoY growth. What was once a beautiful thing???the like-mindedness???was no longer beautiful to me. I started to notice a lot of similar thinking???group think as they call it.
2018-01-12 11:48:25		Silicon Valley is paradoxically a predictable place founded on the idea of being unpredictable.

2018-01-12 11:48:25		https://medium.com/@preethikasireddy/why-im-leaving-silicon-valley-72919edb3297
2018-01-12 11:48:25		Thanks to the freedoms of the developer lifestyle, I started to travel more and meet engineers from all around the world???Paris, London, India, Vienna, Australia, Berlin, Tel Aviv, South Africa, Argentina, South Korea???and I started to see that Silicon Valley wasn?t the only place where world-changing engineering, technology, and innovation was happening. What I once thought was only something I could find in Silicon Valley, was starting to appear in every city I visited. Early seeds of technology and innovation were being planted in places like New York, Los Angeles, Toronto, Berlin, Tel Aviv, India, Switzerland and even South Africa.
2018-01-12 11:48:25		....
2018-01-12 11:48:25		Despite it being the center of tech and innovation for decades, I?m not the only engineer to notice a degree of homogeny in Silicon Valley culture lately. What made it homogenous was that everyone seemed to have a similar story???whether they were software engineers, product managers, venture capitalists or entrepreneurs. The career paths and goals may have been different from what my home town in New Jersey offered? but within the Valley, you?d hear the same stories over and over. Every coffee shop I went to or restaurant I ate at, I?d overhear people talking about their $20M rounds, $200M exits or their 200% YoY growth. What was once a beautiful thing???the like-mindedness???was no longer beautiful to me. I started to notice a lot of similar thinking???group think as they call it.
2018-01-12 11:48:25		Silicon Valley is paradoxically a predictable place founded on the idea of being unpredictable.

2018-01-12 11:48:25		Thanks to the freedoms of the developer lifestyle, I started to travel more and meet engineers from all around the world???Paris, London, India, Vienna, Australia, Berlin, Tel Aviv, South Africa, Argentina, South Korea???and I started to see that Silicon Valley wasn?t the only place where world-changing engineering, technology, and innovation was happening. What I once thought was only something I could find in Silicon Valley, was starting to appear in every city I visited. Early seeds of technology and innovation were being planted in places like New York, Los Angeles, Toronto, Berlin, Tel Aviv, India, Switzerland and even South Africa.
2018-01-12 11:48:25		....
2018-01-12 11:48:25		Despite it being the center of tech and innovation for decades, I?m not the only engineer to notice a degree of homogeny in Silicon Valley culture lately. What made it homogenous was that everyone seemed to have a similar story???whether they were software engineers, product managers, venture capitalists or entrepreneurs. The career paths and goals may have been different from what my home town in New Jersey offered? but within the Valley, you?d hear the same stories over and over. Every coffee shop I went to or restaurant I ate at, I?d overhear people talking about their $20M rounds, $200M exits or their 200% YoY growth. What was once a beautiful thing???the like-mindedness???was no longer beautiful to me. I started to notice a lot of similar thinking???group think as they call it.
2018-01-12 11:48:25		Silicon Valley is paradoxically a predictable place founded on the idea of being unpredictable.

2018-01-09 17:16:57		APL (named after the book A Programming Language) is a programming language developed in the 1960s by Kenneth E. Iverson. Its central datatype is the multidimensional array. It uses a large range of special graphic symbols to represent most functions and operators, leading to very concise code. It has been an important influence on the development of concept modeling, spreadsheets, functional programming, and computer math packages. It has also inspired several other programming languages. It is still used today for certain applications.

2018-01-09 17:16:57		APL (named after the book A Programming Language) is a programming language developed in the 1960s by Kenneth E. Iverson. Its central datatype is the multidimensional array. It uses a large range of special graphic symbols to represent most functions and operators, leading to very concise code. It has been an important influence on the development of concept modeling, spreadsheets, functional programming, and computer math packages. It has also inspired several other programming languages. It is still used today for certain applications.

2018-01-12 11:48:25		https://medium.com/@preethikasireddy/why-im-leaving-silicon-valley-72919edb3297
2018-01-12 11:48:25		Thanks to the freedoms of the developer lifestyle, I started to travel more and meet engineers from all around the world???Paris, London, India, Vienna, Australia, Berlin, Tel Aviv, South Africa, Argentina, South Korea???and I started to see that Silicon Valley wasn?t the only place where world-changing engineering, technology, and innovation was happening. What I once thought was only something I could find in Silicon Valley, was starting to appear in every city I visited. Early seeds of technology and innovation were being planted in places like New York, Los Angeles, Toronto, Berlin, Tel Aviv, India, Switzerland and even South Africa.
2018-01-12 11:48:25		....
2018-01-12 11:48:25		Despite it being the center of tech and innovation for decades, I?m not the only engineer to notice a degree of homogeny in Silicon Valley culture lately. What made it homogenous was that everyone seemed to have a similar story???whether they were software engineers, product managers, venture capitalists or entrepreneurs. The career paths and goals may have been different from what my home town in New Jersey offered? but within the Valley, you?d hear the same stories over and over. Every coffee shop I went to or restaurant I ate at, I?d overhear people talking about their $20M rounds, $200M exits or their 200% YoY growth. What was once a beautiful thing???the like-mindedness???was no longer beautiful to me. I started to notice a lot of similar thinking???group think as they call it.
2018-01-12 11:48:25		Silicon Valley is paradoxically a predictable place founded on the idea of being unpredictable.
2018-01-12 11:48:25		Why I?m leaving Silicon Valley ? Preethi Kasireddy ? Medium

2018-01-09 17:16:57		APL (named after the book A Programming Language) is a programming language developed in the 1960s by Kenneth E. Iverson. Its central datatype is the multidimensional array. It uses a large range of special graphic symbols to represent most functions and operators, leading to very concise code. It has been an important influence on the development of concept modeling, spreadsheets, functional programming, and computer math packages. It has also inspired several other programming languages. It is still used today for certain applications.

2018-01-12 11:48:25		https://medium.com/@preethikasireddy/why-im-leaving-silicon-valley-72919edb3297
2018-01-12 11:48:25		Thanks to the freedoms of the developer lifestyle, I started to travel more and meet engineers from all around the world???Paris, London, India, Vienna, Australia, Berlin, Tel Aviv, South Africa, Argentina, South Korea???and I started to see that Silicon Valley wasn?t the only place where world-changing engineering, technology, and innovation was happening. What I once thought was only something I could find in Silicon Valley, was starting to appear in every city I visited. Early seeds of technology and innovation were being planted in places like New York, Los Angeles, Toronto, Berlin, Tel Aviv, India, Switzerland and even South Africa.
2018-01-12 11:48:25		....
2018-01-12 11:48:25		Despite it being the center of tech and innovation for decades, I?m not the only engineer to notice a degree of homogeny in Silicon Valley culture lately. What made it homogenous was that everyone seemed to have a similar story???whether they were software engineers, product managers, venture capitalists or entrepreneurs. The career paths and goals may have been different from what my home town in New Jersey offered? but within the Valley, you?d hear the same stories over and over. Every coffee shop I went to or restaurant I ate at, I?d overhear people talking about their $20M rounds, $200M exits or their 200% YoY growth. What was once a beautiful thing???the like-mindedness???was no longer beautiful to me. I started to notice a lot of similar thinking???group think as they call it.
2018-01-12 11:48:25		Silicon Valley is paradoxically a predictable place founded on the idea of being unpredictable.
2018-01-12 11:48:25		Why I?m leaving Silicon Valley ? Preethi Kasireddy ? Medium

2018-01-09 17:16:57		Wikipedia: APL (programming language)
2018-01-09 17:16:57		APL (named after the book A Programming Language) is a programming language developed in the 1960s by Kenneth E. Iverson. Its central datatype is the multidimensional array. It uses a large range of special graphic symbols to represent most functions and operators, leading to very concise code. It has been an important influence on the development of concept modeling, spreadsheets, functional programming, and computer math packages. It has also inspired several other programming languages. It is still used today for certain applications.

2018-01-12 11:48:25		https://medium.com/@preethikasireddy/why-im-leaving-silicon-valley-72919edb3297
2018-01-12 11:48:25		Thanks to the freedoms of the developer lifestyle, I started to travel more and meet engineers from all around the world???Paris, London, India, Vienna, Australia, Berlin, Tel Aviv, South Africa, Argentina, South Korea???and I started to see that Silicon Valley wasn?t the only place where world-changing engineering, technology, and innovation was happening. What I once thought was only something I could find in Silicon Valley, was starting to appear in every city I visited. Early seeds of technology and innovation were being planted in places like New York, Los Angeles, Toronto, Berlin, Tel Aviv, India, Switzerland and even South Africa.
2018-01-12 11:48:25		....
2018-01-12 11:48:25		Despite it being the center of tech and innovation for decades, I?m not the only engineer to notice a degree of homogeny in Silicon Valley culture lately. What made it homogenous was that everyone seemed to have a similar story???whether they were software engineers, product managers, venture capitalists or entrepreneurs. The career paths and goals may have been different from what my home town in New Jersey offered? but within the Valley, you?d hear the same stories over and over. Every coffee shop I went to or restaurant I ate at, I?d overhear people talking about their $20M rounds, $200M exits or their 200% YoY growth. What was once a beautiful thing???the like-mindedness???was no longer beautiful to me. I started to notice a lot of similar thinking???group think as they call it.
2018-01-12 11:48:25		Silicon Valley is paradoxically a predictable place founded on the idea of being unpredictable.

2018-01-09 17:16:57		APL (named after the book A Programming Language) is a programming language developed in the 1960s by Kenneth E. Iverson. Its central datatype is the multidimensional array. It uses a large range of special graphic symbols to represent most functions and operators, leading to very concise code. It has been an important influence on the development of concept modeling, spreadsheets, functional programming, and computer math packages. It has also inspired several other programming languages. It is still used today for certain applications.

2018-01-12 11:48:25		https://medium.com/@preethikasireddy/why-im-leaving-silicon-valley-72919edb3297
2018-01-12 11:48:25		Thanks to the freedoms of the developer lifestyle, I started to travel more and meet engineers from all around the world???Paris, London, India, Vienna, Australia, Berlin, Tel Aviv, South Africa, Argentina, South Korea???and I started to see that Silicon Valley wasn?t the only place where world-changing engineering, technology, and innovation was happening. What I once thought was only something I could find in Silicon Valley, was starting to appear in every city I visited. Early seeds of technology and innovation were being planted in places like New York, Los Angeles, Toronto, Berlin, Tel Aviv, India, Switzerland and even South Africa.
2018-01-12 11:48:25		....
2018-01-12 11:48:25		Despite it being the center of tech and innovation for decades, I?m not the only engineer to notice a degree of homogeny in Silicon Valley culture lately. What made it homogenous was that everyone seemed to have a similar story???whether they were software engineers, product managers, venture capitalists or entrepreneurs. The career paths and goals may have been different from what my home town in New Jersey offered? but within the Valley, you?d hear the same stories over and over. Every coffee shop I went to or restaurant I ate at, I?d overhear people talking about their $20M rounds, $200M exits or their 200% YoY growth. What was once a beautiful thing???the like-mindedness???was no longer beautiful to me. I started to notice a lot of similar thinking???group think as they call it.
2018-01-12 11:48:25		Silicon Valley is paradoxically a predictable place founded on the idea of being unpredictable.

2018-02-07 17:17:33	timm	We've all had days like like this: "I'm a cow,  who does not know how,  to be a vow to live  as a human cause I'm not human.  I'm really stupid." [:raised_hands:11 :fire:2]

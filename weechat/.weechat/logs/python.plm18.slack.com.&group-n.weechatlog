2018-03-17 00:11:58	ajshryoc	You can delete cardsTest.py if no one is using it. I would probably make a new directory in the git repo called 'project3' or something so that we have a record of both of our submissions. As for the issues with the games, if you want to ask him, go ahead. I think we could make it work but I'm sure he could provide some insight. <--- Sorry typed this up about 14 hours ago and never hit send

2018-01-23 17:45:08	Jesse	Hello 
2018-01-27 17:50:56	Jesse	we should probably figure out what 2 card games we are going to choose. 
2018-01-27 17:52:53	Jesse	so one has to be some variant of a game which I forgot the name to.. and the other could be anything that involves the standard 52 deck of cards. 
2018-01-27 17:58:05	Jesse	I'm thinking solitaire or some variant of it would be pretty easy to program. 
2018-01-27 18:00:03	Jesse	it wouldnt be as easy as something like blackjack or go fish but those ones are already taken. 
2018-01-27 20:53:36	ajshryoc	I'm cool with solitaire. The game you forgot the name to is Bartok. A Bartok variant I would suggest we annotate would be Crazy Eights. 
2018-01-27 20:54:10	Jesse	im not familiar with either of the two games 
2018-01-27 20:54:36	ajshryoc	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crazy_Eights
2018-01-27 20:54:36		Wikipedia: Crazy Eights
2018-01-27 20:54:36		Crazy Eights is a shedding-type card game for two to seven players. The object of the game is to be the first to get rid of all the player's cards to a discard pile. The game is considered a pre-extension of Switch and Mau Mau.
2018-01-27 20:54:36		A standard 52-card deck is used when there are five or fewer players. When there are more than five players, two decks are shuffled together and all 104 cards are used. 
2018-01-27 20:54:59	ajshryoc	Not familiar with solitaire? Or Bartok? 
2018-01-27 22:25:26	Jesse	bartok and crazy eight. 
2018-01-28 20:18:47	ajshryoc	Bartok is just the game where you have a hand and have to play cards that match a card with the same suit/rank until you run out of cards. Crazy Eights is just that with a couple of other additions, if I remember 
2018-01-28 20:33:54	Jesse	gotcha. well it may make it difficult if we choose a game vastly different from that, so idk if solitaire is a good idea... but I'm sure we could do it if we cant find a better game. 
2018-01-28 20:54:33	ajshryoc	I mean, technically our language should be able to create any kind of game so having two very different games to base it off of might actually be beneficial, although a little more work for the annotation. 
2018-01-28 20:55:28	Jesse	should we call dibs on solitaire then in the proj1 channel? 
2018-01-28 20:57:45	ajshryoc	I'm cool with that 
2018-01-28 21:11:35	ajshryoc	Do we have to claim both games? Or just the non-Bartok clone one? 
2018-01-28 21:12:15	Jesse	i guess juat the non-bartok 
2018-01-28 21:12:27	Jesse	just* 
2018-01-29 17:21:22	Jesse	When can you guys meet up to work on the card game annotations? 
2018-01-29 17:22:08	Jesse	I'm free up until 4:30 on thursday. 
2018-01-29 17:22:23	Jesse	or any time on friday 
2018-01-29 17:30:09	ajshryoc	Between 2 and 4:30 on Thursday works for me 
2018-01-29 17:33:21	Jesse	sounds good to me. 
2018-01-29 17:49:17	jwstanl3	I'm busy 2-6pm pretty much everyday except for Friday 
2018-01-29 17:50:03	Jesse	id be willing to meet up on friday. what about you andrew? 
2018-01-29 17:53:51	ajshryoc	I've got senior design 10:40-12:30 on friday and I typically work afterwards. I could meet before class if that is an option for you guys? Another suggestion would be after class Thursday 
2018-01-29 17:54:37	jwstanl3	I can meet after class Thursday 
2018-01-29 17:54:48	Jesse	Yeah I can do that 
2018-01-29 17:55:25	ajshryoc	Alright, cool 
2018-02-01 20:59:14	Jesse	hey guys, I put in a little bit at the end of the card game annotations. please check if theres anything you'd like to add or modify. 
2018-02-01 21:35:25	ajshryoc	That part looks good and I think was a smart addition 
2018-02-01 21:35:41	Jesse	thank you 
2018-02-01 21:37:41	ajshryoc	I will probably go back to this throughout the weekend if I think of more similarities/differences to add. Overall though, I think it looks good. I probably won't be able to put in a good chunk of time on this assignment until Monday, but I don't think it'll take that long to write out what we already have. 
2018-02-01 21:38:41	Jesse	when you mean write out, do you mean hand-written? 
2018-02-01 21:39:15	ajshryoc	Sorry, I mean like write out in a sentence rather than just a list 
2018-02-01 21:40:00	Jesse	Ahh.. I'm not too sure its important to have it in sentence form, but if you think that would be better, go for it xD 
2018-02-01 21:40:48	Jesse	i can of course help too.. just want to be sure thats something you think is important 
2018-02-01 21:42:56	ajshryoc	I suppose he doesn't really say what format it should be in and only says "list what is similar, what is different", so I'm not entirely sure what he's looking for. I think as long as it's clear we can have it in list form, maybe just with an intro paragraph for each section. 
2018-02-01 21:45:00	Jesse	I don't think he knows what he is looking for lol. And I'm not too sure what I would put in an intro paragraph. 
2018-02-01 23:04:13	ajshryoc	Yeah, good point. We can see how it is and how much time we want to put in next week. 
2018-02-05 21:28:33	ajshryoc	I'm working on the annotations a litte. Just trying to add some more words to the game descriptions. Let me know what you guys think and feel free to add anything 
2018-02-06 19:31:23	ajshryoc	I made a couple small additions to the annotation. Mainly just for formatting/flow. Let me know what you guys think and add whatever else you think we need. If you guys think it's good, I can submit the doc 
2018-02-06 20:39:28	Jesse	ill take a look now. sorry i was distracted 
2018-02-06 20:44:36	Jesse	well dang. thats a lot more of an improvement than i was expecting. Nice work Andrew  
2018-02-06 20:45:22	jwstanl3	Everything looks good 
2018-02-06 20:47:21	Jesse	yeah I agree. 
2018-02-06 20:48:54	Jesse	would you like me to submit? 
2018-02-06 20:49:09	ajshryoc	Thanks, just took what we had before and made it flow a little better  
2018-02-06 20:49:18	ajshryoc	Yeah, go ahead and submit if you want 
2018-02-06 20:50:39	Jesse	done 
2018-02-06 20:50:49	ajshryoc	Sweet 
2018-02-11 09:22:16	Jesse	Hey guys do either of you understand the homework? 
2018-02-11 11:38:18	ajshryoc	I have not taken a look at it so far. I just saw that Alex Phelps posted some tips in #homework that seemed helpful. Will probably get to the homework later today or tomorrow 
2018-02-11 11:49:28	Jesse	yeah. i gotcha 
2018-02-12 21:17:50	ajshryoc	Have you guys finished the homework? I think I've got it---it looks like it's behaving correctly, but I'm not sure what he wants exactly 
2018-02-13 10:43:30	Jesse	I submitted something but I don't think it's right at all. I just made the program look like it was doing something right and submittted it. 
2018-02-13 14:46:06	Jesse	I just pushed  a starter to our cardgame project in our github repo. check it out when ya get the chance. i was just sketching some things up so feel free to modify whatever. 
2018-02-13 15:46:25	ajshryoc	Okay, I'll check it out 
2018-02-14 21:35:45	ajshryoc	@ajshryoc shared a file: https://plm18.slack.com/files/U8M1VEVT3/F98NZUTNC/CSC495_Project_Todo_List (CSC495 Project Todo List) 
2018-02-14 21:35:45		@ajshryoc commented on @ajshryoc?s file https://plm18.slack.com/files/U8M1VEVT3/F98NZUTNC/CSC495_Project_Todo_List (CSC495 Project Todo List): Hey guys, I did a little design work on an approach I've thought of for implementing the two games based on some stuff we've talked about in class. I mainly just tried to break down the game object that were suggested we use in class in the context of a finite state machine. Let me know what you think and if you have suggestions/feedback. We could then write this up as GitHub issues. That way, we can assign things as tasks. 
2018-02-14 21:42:45	Jesse	thats a pretty solid writeup. I'll spend some more time looking over it later.  I think the most complex thing is going to be implementing rules and goals since they can vary  a lot from game to game. 
2018-02-14 21:44:58	ajshryoc	I agree. That along with what constitutes a valid move---especially with solitaire. 
2018-02-15 14:40:27	Jesse	hey guys, i'm gonna be late to class today. I've got a video call with the people i'll be interning with from 3:30 to 4:30. 
2018-02-16 00:07:50	ajshryoc	added an integration to this channel: https://plm18.slack.com/services/B9A0YJ9V1 (github) 
2018-02-16 00:12:00	ajshryoc	I've converted the list I wrote up yesterday into a few GitHub issues. Please feel free to take a look and modify if you see fit. With these we can more easily divide up tasks (or subtasks) and tag commits/branches with them. I also added the GitHub app to this channel, which will post when events happen on the repo. If it starts to get annoying, I can reduce the notifications or turn it off. Figured I'd give it a shot and see if it's useful for keeping everyone up to date on code changes 
2018-02-16 10:06:31	Jesse	I'll start working on this tomorrow. I'm dedicating today to English 331 and research. thanks for this Andrew. [:+1:1] 
2018-02-17 12:56:28	Jesse	I'm gonna be working on this project starting now. I'll try to document my work here. I'm willing to meet up at Hunt if you guys are interested, but it's not necessary. 
2018-02-17 13:04:31	ajshryoc	Sweet. I may work on this depending on how quickly I can do my networks homework today.  
2018-02-17 13:07:13	Jesse	Ok. I'm gonna be looking more into higher level design aspects rather than implementation. I'll let you know what I find. [:+1:1] 
2018-02-17 14:19:00	Jesse	I think I've worked out most of the ambiguous stuff. i can try to upload my notes but it is quite illegible, so ill have to meet with you guys some time to explain.
2018-02-17 14:19:00		Once I work out the rest of the thinking stuff, Ill try to lay out what needs to be done in the form of  a informal UML diagram. From there, I'm going to give out some tasks as far as implementation of this UML. 
2018-02-17 14:19:00		this is my goal for today.

2018-02-17 17:47:09	Jesse	Hey guys, I pushed my UML diagram. Tomorrow I'll handle some of the basic classes like hand, pile, deck and whatever. I also assigned myself to the UI task. 
2018-02-17 17:47:30	ajshryoc	Hey @jwstanl3, which one of the two games would you like to work on? 
2018-02-17 20:14:45	jwstanl3	I'll look into Solitaire. Sorry for taking so long to reply.

2018-02-19 10:14:55	Jesse	I dont think I updated you guys on what I did in that commit. I implemented the basic structure and started on the solitaire UI. I left the rulebook and other game specific things unimplemented. I would also like to expand the basic structures functionality to things like flipping over a card or moving sets of cards from one pile to another pile. 
2018-02-19 17:12:34	ajshryoc	Yeah, added functionality like that would be great. I'm not sure how difficult it would be, but it would be cool if the Pile class was iterable so that you could use it in a for loop. If it too complicated to add that don't worry about it

2018-02-19 21:24:57	Jesse	I added functionality for piles giving one card or giving a set of cards. [:+1:1]

2018-02-19 21:56:00	Jesse	the UI for solitaire is starting to look good. 
2018-02-19 21:56:28	ajshryoc	Yeah, nice! 
2018-02-19 22:03:59	Jesse	I'm not gonna lie, the base code is a lil messy, so if theres any general features that you think needs to be in there just let me know and I can implement it. 
2018-02-19 22:04:46	Jesse	as for the UI, I'm making it so you guys just pass in a set of piles. and the index in the set of piles will determine which pile is positioned where. 
2018-02-19 22:05:46	Jesse	I also hardcoded the height of the board since we know that there will be no higher stack of cards than 13 (which is Ace-King) in solitaire 
2018-02-19 22:07:38	ajshryoc	That would be pretty sweet if we just have to pass in the piles. I think it looks pretty good. We can worry about code cleanup later too. 
2018-02-19 22:09:08	ajshryoc	I was able to get crazy eights working with just 1 player playing cards on the pile, so it looks like we're in a pretty good spot for this project 
2018-02-19 22:09:23	Jesse	dang really? thats pretty awesome 
2018-02-19 22:10:43	ajshryoc	It'll be a cool project once it's all working. The way we have it setup (with your cards.py objects) made it pretty straightforward to program 
2018-02-19 22:10:45	Jesse	can you tell me what the board would look like for crazy eight? is it just a pile for taking cards and a pile for laying cards? also displaying the hand to the player? 
2018-02-19 22:13:53	ajshryoc	@ajshryoc uploaded a file: https://plm18.slack.com/files/U8M1VEVT3/F9ATPNWBS/crazyeights.jpg (crazyeights.JPG) and commented: Here's what I've been using as a sort of debug UI.  So, there's the pile for taking cards, pile for playing cards, and the player's hand. I'm unsure how to handle the computer players since the number of card they hold is definitely relevant to the player. 
2018-02-19 22:14:54	ajshryoc	I think just listing the AI players and showing how many face down cards are in their hands on different lines would be good enough 
2018-02-19 22:16:20	ajshryoc	As a side note, I defined a Move as a Crazy Eights specific object (although it might be worth pulling out) that is defined by a Card, a "to" Pile, and a "from" Pile. It has a method called "make" that will remove the Card from "from" Pile and add it to "to" Pile. This kinda thing might be useful for solitaire too  (edited)
2018-02-19 22:17:59	Jesse	oh. I made a similar function in my Pile class (giveOneCard) 
2018-02-19 22:19:01	ajshryoc	No problem, that totally works. I'll adjust what I've got to match your code once I pull it in 
2018-02-19 22:19:20	Jesse	Would you guys be willing to meet up tomorrow so that we can clean up our code? / continue developing? 
2018-02-19 22:19:32	Jesse	I'm good all day except class time 
2018-02-19 22:20:10	ajshryoc	I'm good from around 1:30 to class time 
2018-02-19 22:24:03	Jesse	okay. I'd be down to meet then.

2018-02-20 07:46:29	jwstanl3	Would you guys be able to meet after class? I have a class from 1:30-2:45 and then I tutor from 3-4 
2018-02-20 10:30:28	Jesse	Yeah. Would you be able to meet after class andrew? I don't think we need a lot of time. My plan was just to use an hour or two to clean up some of the code in the generic game structure/UI's and implement any functionality you guys think would be good for both games. 
2018-02-20 10:32:21	Jesse	If not, I could meet with andrew an hour before class and then after class with Joseph for an hour. 
2018-02-20 11:36:11	ajshryoc	I could meet briefly right after class 
2018-02-20 11:36:34	Jesse	cool! 
2018-02-20 12:00:47	jwstanl3	I have the solitaire game pretty much working completely, but I changed some things in the cards and SolitaireUI files, so I'll wait until we meet to commit anything

2018-02-20 13:05:32	Jesse	thats awesome!! but arent the red cards supposed to go on black cards and vice versa? 
2018-02-20 13:05:45	Jesse	its okay if we want to change it for the sake of project scope 
2018-02-20 13:05:53	Jesse	to be red on red 
2018-02-20 13:08:42	jwstanl3	The rules from Bicycle didn't have any restrictions on color. It just had to be consecutive. But, yea, normally you would alternate colors, and it would be pretty easy to switch the program to follow that. 
2018-02-20 13:09:15	jwstanl3	The game's really easy at the moment, so adding something like that would help it be more challenging.

2018-02-21 20:28:57	jwstanl3	I pushed some fixes to my solitaire code. Cards have to alternate in color now in the stacks. There were a few other bugs I fixed. I still haven't added a win state, or a loss state really, but it should be able to detect a win or loss, if the loss state doesn't have any moves left. I haven't been able to beat the game since adding the alternating colors, so I'm not sure if this is true or not.

2018-02-22 22:08:38	ajshryoc	Added what I have for crazy eights. I think the only major feature missing is the suit change when playing an 8. I also intend to clean up the code and little bit to get rid of redundancy.  (edited)
2018-02-22 22:12:02	Jesse	great!! I'll probably take a look some time this weekend 
2018-02-23 10:48:02	Jesse	do you guys know where Menzies notes on lisp are? I cant find them

2018-02-24 12:28:32	Jesse	Do you guys understand python decorators? I haven't been able to reproduce a function that demonstrates the difference with/without the decorator. 
2018-02-25 20:28:31	ajshryoc	Sorry, intended to respond, then totally forgot about this. My understanding of python decorators is it's just another form of syntax for calling functions; however, it sort of ties two functions together and modifies the function being decorated. Here's an article I found that gives a good explanation on the subject: http://python-3-patterns-idioms-test.readthedocs.io/en/latest/PythonDecorators.html

2018-02-25 22:39:22	ajshryoc	Just pushed the finished version of Crazy Eights. It's kinda a mess, so I'll probably do some refactoring of it at some point. I also modified cards.py to print out the unicode symbol corresponding to the card's suit. I was curious about how to do it and it turned out to be really easy, so I added it. I think it makes it much easier to see the cards 
2018-02-25 22:41:04	Jesse	oh nice!!! let me know if theres anything youd like me to change.  
2018-02-26 13:50:38	Jesse	I played both crazy eights and solitaire and I haven't noticed any bugs. winning looks good as well. 
2018-02-26 13:52:31	Jesse	we may be able to polish a few things up but honestly, it doesn't matter too much because we'll be taking parts of our code out and re implementing stuff for the second submission. I think what we have is gold. If there's anything you guys want me to change, just let me know. 
2018-02-26 17:12:29	ajshryoc	Glad you liked it! I think they both play pretty well 
2018-03-12 13:07:36	Jesse	Hey guys, we need to figure out what we need to submit and submit it before class tomorrow. 
2018-03-12 13:11:03	Jesse	Do you guys have the transcript of the 2 games? if not I can make them. 
2018-03-12 13:12:50	ajshryoc	I don't have a transcript. You should be able to use the tee command to output to a file and stdout 
2018-03-12 13:13:04	Jesse	I was just gonna use script 
2018-03-12 13:13:18	Jesse	it automatically outputs the log to a file 
2018-03-12 13:13:31	ajshryoc	Yeah, whatever works 
2018-03-12 13:13:53	Jesse	alright. 
2018-03-12 13:24:42	ajshryoc	Thanks

2018-03-12 14:41:24	Jesse	Alright, the transcripts are made. Can someone else do the work of submitting and making a cheap readme with some basic information like linking to the transcript file and how to run each of the games?

2018-03-16 10:13:12	Jesse	Nobody but me used cardsTest.py right? would you guys mind if I deleted that file? 
2018-03-16 10:17:46	Jesse	We may want to ask the professor about this... I worry our games are too different. 
2018-03-17 00:11:58	ajshryoc	You can delete cardsTest.py if no one is using it. I would probably make a new directory in the git repo called 'project3' or something so that we have a record of both of our submissions. As for the issues with the games, if you want to ask him, go ahead. I think we could make it work but I'm sure he could provide some insight. <--- Sorry typed this up about 14 hours ago and never hit send 
2018-03-19 14:19:24	Jesse	We got a 90% it seems on what we submitted for the project. He said he liked our nouns/verbs but was disappointed that we didn't make an FSM. He also linked "Derive Interfaces from Constraints of Data" as if its some reading on moodle or github. 
2018-03-19 14:19:57	Jesse	... I checked both, and I'm not sure what he's talking about

2018-01-23 17:45:08	Jesse	Hello 
2018-01-27 17:50:56	Jesse	we should probably figure out what 2 card games we are going to choose. 
2018-01-27 17:52:53	Jesse	so one has to be some variant of a game which I forgot the name to.. and the other could be anything that involves the standard 52 deck of cards. 
2018-01-27 17:58:05	Jesse	I'm thinking solitaire or some variant of it would be pretty easy to program. 
2018-01-27 18:00:03	Jesse	it wouldnt be as easy as something like blackjack or go fish but those ones are already taken. 
2018-01-27 20:53:36	ajshryoc	I'm cool with solitaire. The game you forgot the name to is Bartok. A Bartok variant I would suggest we annotate would be Crazy Eights. 
2018-01-27 20:54:10	Jesse	im not familiar with either of the two games 
2018-01-27 20:54:36	ajshryoc	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crazy_Eights
2018-01-27 20:54:36		Wikipedia: Crazy Eights
2018-01-27 20:54:36		Crazy Eights is a shedding-type card game for two to seven players. The object of the game is to be the first to get rid of all the player's cards to a discard pile. The game is considered a pre-extension of Switch and Mau Mau.
2018-01-27 20:54:36		A standard 52-card deck is used when there are five or fewer players. When there are more than five players, two decks are shuffled together and all 104 cards are used. 
2018-01-27 20:54:59	ajshryoc	Not familiar with solitaire? Or Bartok? 
2018-01-27 22:25:26	Jesse	bartok and crazy eight. 
2018-01-28 20:18:47	ajshryoc	Bartok is just the game where you have a hand and have to play cards that match a card with the same suit/rank until you run out of cards. Crazy Eights is just that with a couple of other additions, if I remember 
2018-01-28 20:33:54	Jesse	gotcha. well it may make it difficult if we choose a game vastly different from that, so idk if solitaire is a good idea... but I'm sure we could do it if we cant find a better game. 
2018-01-28 20:54:33	ajshryoc	I mean, technically our language should be able to create any kind of game so having two very different games to base it off of might actually be beneficial, although a little more work for the annotation. 
2018-01-28 20:55:28	Jesse	should we call dibs on solitaire then in the proj1 channel? 
2018-01-28 20:57:45	ajshryoc	I'm cool with that 
2018-01-28 21:11:35	ajshryoc	Do we have to claim both games? Or just the non-Bartok clone one? 
2018-01-28 21:12:15	Jesse	i guess juat the non-bartok 
2018-01-28 21:12:27	Jesse	just* 
2018-01-29 17:21:22	Jesse	When can you guys meet up to work on the card game annotations? 
2018-01-29 17:22:08	Jesse	I'm free up until 4:30 on thursday. 
2018-01-29 17:22:23	Jesse	or any time on friday 
2018-01-29 17:30:09	ajshryoc	Between 2 and 4:30 on Thursday works for me 
2018-01-29 17:33:21	Jesse	sounds good to me. 
2018-01-29 17:49:17	jwstanl3	I'm busy 2-6pm pretty much everyday except for Friday 
2018-01-29 17:50:03	Jesse	id be willing to meet up on friday. what about you andrew? 
2018-01-29 17:53:51	ajshryoc	I've got senior design 10:40-12:30 on friday and I typically work afterwards. I could meet before class if that is an option for you guys? Another suggestion would be after class Thursday 
2018-01-29 17:54:37	jwstanl3	I can meet after class Thursday 
2018-01-29 17:54:48	Jesse	Yeah I can do that 
2018-01-29 17:55:25	ajshryoc	Alright, cool 
2018-02-01 20:59:14	Jesse	hey guys, I put in a little bit at the end of the card game annotations. please check if theres anything you'd like to add or modify. 
2018-02-01 21:35:25	ajshryoc	That part looks good and I think was a smart addition 
2018-02-01 21:35:41	Jesse	thank you 
2018-02-01 21:37:41	ajshryoc	I will probably go back to this throughout the weekend if I think of more similarities/differences to add. Overall though, I think it looks good. I probably won't be able to put in a good chunk of time on this assignment until Monday, but I don't think it'll take that long to write out what we already have. 
2018-02-01 21:38:41	Jesse	when you mean write out, do you mean hand-written? 
2018-02-01 21:39:15	ajshryoc	Sorry, I mean like write out in a sentence rather than just a list 
2018-02-01 21:40:00	Jesse	Ahh.. I'm not too sure its important to have it in sentence form, but if you think that would be better, go for it xD 
2018-02-01 21:40:48	Jesse	i can of course help too.. just want to be sure thats something you think is important 
2018-02-01 21:42:56	ajshryoc	I suppose he doesn't really say what format it should be in and only says "list what is similar, what is different", so I'm not entirely sure what he's looking for. I think as long as it's clear we can have it in list form, maybe just with an intro paragraph for each section. 
2018-02-01 21:45:00	Jesse	I don't think he knows what he is looking for lol. And I'm not too sure what I would put in an intro paragraph. 
2018-02-01 23:04:13	ajshryoc	Yeah, good point. We can see how it is and how much time we want to put in next week. 
2018-02-05 21:28:33	ajshryoc	I'm working on the annotations a litte. Just trying to add some more words to the game descriptions. Let me know what you guys think and feel free to add anything 
2018-02-06 19:31:23	ajshryoc	I made a couple small additions to the annotation. Mainly just for formatting/flow. Let me know what you guys think and add whatever else you think we need. If you guys think it's good, I can submit the doc 
2018-02-06 20:39:28	Jesse	ill take a look now. sorry i was distracted 
2018-02-06 20:44:36	Jesse	well dang. thats a lot more of an improvement than i was expecting. Nice work Andrew  
2018-02-06 20:45:22	jwstanl3	Everything looks good 
2018-02-06 20:47:21	Jesse	yeah I agree. 
2018-02-06 20:48:54	Jesse	would you like me to submit? 
2018-02-06 20:49:09	ajshryoc	Thanks, just took what we had before and made it flow a little better  
2018-02-06 20:49:18	ajshryoc	Yeah, go ahead and submit if you want 
2018-02-06 20:50:39	Jesse	done 
2018-02-06 20:50:49	ajshryoc	Sweet 
2018-02-11 09:22:16	Jesse	Hey guys do either of you understand the homework? 
2018-02-11 11:38:18	ajshryoc	I have not taken a look at it so far. I just saw that Alex Phelps posted some tips in #homework that seemed helpful. Will probably get to the homework later today or tomorrow 
2018-02-11 11:49:28	Jesse	yeah. i gotcha 
2018-02-12 21:17:50	ajshryoc	Have you guys finished the homework? I think I've got it---it looks like it's behaving correctly, but I'm not sure what he wants exactly 
2018-02-13 10:43:30	Jesse	I submitted something but I don't think it's right at all. I just made the program look like it was doing something right and submittted it. 
2018-02-13 14:46:06	Jesse	I just pushed  a starter to our cardgame project in our github repo. check it out when ya get the chance. i was just sketching some things up so feel free to modify whatever. 
2018-02-13 15:46:25	ajshryoc	Okay, I'll check it out 
2018-02-14 21:35:45	ajshryoc	@ajshryoc shared a file: https://plm18.slack.com/files/U8M1VEVT3/F98NZUTNC/CSC495_Project_Todo_List (CSC495 Project Todo List) 
2018-02-14 21:35:45		@ajshryoc commented on @ajshryoc?s file https://plm18.slack.com/files/U8M1VEVT3/F98NZUTNC/CSC495_Project_Todo_List (CSC495 Project Todo List): Hey guys, I did a little design work on an approach I've thought of for implementing the two games based on some stuff we've talked about in class. I mainly just tried to break down the game object that were suggested we use in class in the context of a finite state machine. Let me know what you think and if you have suggestions/feedback. We could then write this up as GitHub issues. That way, we can assign things as tasks. 
2018-02-14 21:42:45	Jesse	thats a pretty solid writeup. I'll spend some more time looking over it later.  I think the most complex thing is going to be implementing rules and goals since they can vary  a lot from game to game. 
2018-02-14 21:44:58	ajshryoc	I agree. That along with what constitutes a valid move---especially with solitaire. 
2018-02-15 14:40:27	Jesse	hey guys, i'm gonna be late to class today. I've got a video call with the people i'll be interning with from 3:30 to 4:30. 
2018-02-16 00:07:50	ajshryoc	added an integration to this channel: https://plm18.slack.com/services/B9A0YJ9V1 (github) 
2018-02-16 00:12:00	ajshryoc	I've converted the list I wrote up yesterday into a few GitHub issues. Please feel free to take a look and modify if you see fit. With these we can more easily divide up tasks (or subtasks) and tag commits/branches with them. I also added the GitHub app to this channel, which will post when events happen on the repo. If it starts to get annoying, I can reduce the notifications or turn it off. Figured I'd give it a shot and see if it's useful for keeping everyone up to date on code changes 
2018-02-16 10:06:31	Jesse	I'll start working on this tomorrow. I'm dedicating today to English 331 and research. thanks for this Andrew. [:+1:1] 
2018-02-17 12:56:28	Jesse	I'm gonna be working on this project starting now. I'll try to document my work here. I'm willing to meet up at Hunt if you guys are interested, but it's not necessary. 
2018-02-17 13:04:31	ajshryoc	Sweet. I may work on this depending on how quickly I can do my networks homework today.  
2018-02-17 13:07:13	Jesse	Ok. I'm gonna be looking more into higher level design aspects rather than implementation. I'll let you know what I find. [:+1:1] 
2018-02-17 14:19:00	Jesse	I think I've worked out most of the ambiguous stuff. i can try to upload my notes but it is quite illegible, so ill have to meet with you guys some time to explain.
2018-02-17 14:19:00		Once I work out the rest of the thinking stuff, Ill try to lay out what needs to be done in the form of  a informal UML diagram. From there, I'm going to give out some tasks as far as implementation of this UML. 
2018-02-17 14:19:00		this is my goal for today.

2018-02-17 17:47:09	Jesse	Hey guys, I pushed my UML diagram. Tomorrow I'll handle some of the basic classes like hand, pile, deck and whatever. I also assigned myself to the UI task. 
2018-02-17 17:47:30	ajshryoc	Hey @jwstanl3, which one of the two games would you like to work on? 
2018-02-17 20:14:45	jwstanl3	I'll look into Solitaire. Sorry for taking so long to reply.

2018-02-19 10:14:55	Jesse	I dont think I updated you guys on what I did in that commit. I implemented the basic structure and started on the solitaire UI. I left the rulebook and other game specific things unimplemented. I would also like to expand the basic structures functionality to things like flipping over a card or moving sets of cards from one pile to another pile. 
2018-02-19 17:12:34	ajshryoc	Yeah, added functionality like that would be great. I'm not sure how difficult it would be, but it would be cool if the Pile class was iterable so that you could use it in a for loop. If it too complicated to add that don't worry about it

2018-02-19 21:24:57	Jesse	I added functionality for piles giving one card or giving a set of cards. [:+1:1] 
2018-02-19 21:55:53	Jesse	@Jesse uploaded a file: https://plm18.slack.com/files/U8N7VJU30/F9B15RLSV/2018-02-19-215521_873x245_scrot.png (solitaireUI.png) 
2018-02-19 21:56:00	Jesse	the UI for solitaire is starting to look good. 
2018-02-19 21:56:28	ajshryoc	Yeah, nice! 
2018-02-19 22:03:59	Jesse	I'm not gonna lie, the base code is a lil messy, so if theres any general features that you think needs to be in there just let me know and I can implement it. 
2018-02-19 22:04:46	Jesse	as for the UI, I'm making it so you guys just pass in a set of piles. and the index in the set of piles will determine which pile is positioned where. 
2018-02-19 22:05:46	Jesse	I also hardcoded the height of the board since we know that there will be no higher stack of cards than 13 (which is Ace-King) in solitaire 
2018-02-19 22:07:38	ajshryoc	That would be pretty sweet if we just have to pass in the piles. I think it looks pretty good. We can worry about code cleanup later too. 
2018-02-19 22:09:08	ajshryoc	I was able to get crazy eights working with just 1 player playing cards on the pile, so it looks like we're in a pretty good spot for this project 
2018-02-19 22:09:23	Jesse	dang really? thats pretty awesome 
2018-02-19 22:10:43	ajshryoc	It'll be a cool project once it's all working. The way we have it setup (with your cards.py objects) made it pretty straightforward to program 
2018-02-19 22:10:45	Jesse	can you tell me what the board would look like for crazy eight? is it just a pile for taking cards and a pile for laying cards? also displaying the hand to the player? 
2018-02-19 22:13:53	ajshryoc	@ajshryoc uploaded a file: https://plm18.slack.com/files/U8M1VEVT3/F9ATPNWBS/crazyeights.jpg (crazyeights.JPG) and commented: Here's what I've been using as a sort of debug UI.  So, there's the pile for taking cards, pile for playing cards, and the player's hand. I'm unsure how to handle the computer players since the number of card they hold is definitely relevant to the player. 
2018-02-19 22:14:54	ajshryoc	I think just listing the AI players and showing how many face down cards are in their hands on different lines would be good enough 
2018-02-19 22:16:20	ajshryoc	As a side note, I defined a Move as a Crazy Eights specific object (although it might be worth pulling out) that is defined by a Card, a "to" Pile, and a "from" Pile. It has a method called "make" that will remove the Card from "from" Pile and add it to "to" Pile. This kinda thing might be useful for solitaire too  (edited)
2018-02-19 22:17:59	Jesse	oh. I made a similar function in my Pile class (giveOneCard) 
2018-02-19 22:19:01	ajshryoc	No problem, that totally works. I'll adjust what I've got to match your code once I pull it in 
2018-02-19 22:19:20	Jesse	Would you guys be willing to meet up tomorrow so that we can clean up our code? / continue developing? 
2018-02-19 22:19:32	Jesse	I'm good all day except class time 
2018-02-19 22:20:10	ajshryoc	I'm good from around 1:30 to class time 
2018-02-19 22:24:03	Jesse	okay. I'd be down to meet then.

2018-02-20 07:46:29	jwstanl3	Would you guys be able to meet after class? I have a class from 1:30-2:45 and then I tutor from 3-4 
2018-02-20 10:30:28	Jesse	Yeah. Would you be able to meet after class andrew? I don't think we need a lot of time. My plan was just to use an hour or two to clean up some of the code in the generic game structure/UI's and implement any functionality you guys think would be good for both games. 
2018-02-20 10:32:21	Jesse	If not, I could meet with andrew an hour before class and then after class with Joseph for an hour. 
2018-02-20 11:36:11	ajshryoc	I could meet briefly right after class 
2018-02-20 11:36:34	Jesse	cool! 
2018-02-20 12:00:47	jwstanl3	I have the solitaire game pretty much working completely, but I changed some things in the cards and SolitaireUI files, so I'll wait until we meet to commit anything 
2018-02-20 12:03:24	jwstanl3	@jwstanl3 uploaded a file: https://plm18.slack.com/files/U8N1B358V/F9B8MRFL0/solitaire.gif (Solitaire GIF) and commented: Here's a GIF of the game.  The only thing I haven't implemented is win and loss states. 
2018-02-20 13:05:32	Jesse	thats awesome!! but arent the red cards supposed to go on black cards and vice versa? 
2018-02-20 13:05:45	Jesse	its okay if we want to change it for the sake of project scope 
2018-02-20 13:05:53	Jesse	to be red on red 
2018-02-20 13:08:42	jwstanl3	The rules from Bicycle didn't have any restrictions on color. It just had to be consecutive. But, yea, normally you would alternate colors, and it would be pretty easy to switch the program to follow that. 
2018-02-20 13:09:15	jwstanl3	The game's really easy at the moment, so adding something like that would help it be more challenging.

2018-02-21 20:28:57	jwstanl3	I pushed some fixes to my solitaire code. Cards have to alternate in color now in the stacks. There were a few other bugs I fixed. I still haven't added a win state, or a loss state really, but it should be able to detect a win or loss, if the loss state doesn't have any moves left. I haven't been able to beat the game since adding the alternating colors, so I'm not sure if this is true or not.

2018-02-22 22:08:38	ajshryoc	Added what I have for crazy eights. I think the only major feature missing is the suit change when playing an 8. I also intend to clean up the code and little bit to get rid of redundancy.  (edited)

2018-02-24 12:28:32	Jesse	Do you guys understand python decorators? I haven't been able to reproduce a function that demonstrates the difference with/without the decorator. 
2018-02-25 20:28:31	ajshryoc	Sorry, intended to respond, then totally forgot about this. My understanding of python decorators is it's just another form of syntax for calling functions; however, it sort of ties two functions together and modifies the function being decorated. Here's an article I found that gives a good explanation on the subject: http://python-3-patterns-idioms-test.readthedocs.io/en/latest/PythonDecorators.html

2018-02-25 22:39:22	ajshryoc	Just pushed the finished version of Crazy Eights. It's kinda a mess, so I'll probably do some refactoring of it at some point. I also modified cards.py to print out the unicode symbol corresponding to the card's suit. I was curious about how to do it and it turned out to be really easy, so I added it. I think it makes it much easier to see the cards 
2018-02-25 22:41:04	Jesse	oh nice!!! let me know if theres anything youd like me to change.  
2018-02-26 13:50:38	Jesse	I played both crazy eights and solitaire and I haven't noticed any bugs. winning looks good as well. 
2018-02-26 13:52:31	Jesse	we may be able to polish a few things up but honestly, it doesn't matter too much because we'll be taking parts of our code out and re implementing stuff for the second submission. I think what we have is gold. If there's anything you guys want me to change, just let me know.

2018-03-16 10:13:12	Jesse	Nobody but me used cardsTest.py right? would you guys mind if I deleted that file? 
2018-03-16 10:17:46	Jesse	We may want to ask the professor about this... I worry our games are too different. 
2018-03-17 00:11:58	ajshryoc	You can delete cardsTest.py if no one is using it. I would probably make a new directory in the git repo called 'project3' or something so that we have a record of both of our submissions. As for the issues with the games, if you want to ask him, go ahead. I think we could make it work but I'm sure he could provide some insight. <--- Sorry typed this up about 14 hours ago and never hit send 
2018-03-19 14:19:24	Jesse	We got a 90% it seems on what we submitted for the project. He said he liked our nouns/verbs but was disappointed that we didn't make an FSM. He also linked "Derive Interfaces from Constraints of Data" as if its some reading on moodle or github. 
2018-03-19 14:19:57	Jesse	... I checked both, and I'm not sure what he's talking about 
2018-03-19 14:36:38	ajshryoc	I'm also unsure what he meant by that. Our design did get a shoutout in #proj2_mar1 though so that's pretty cool 
2018-03-19 14:38:04	Jesse	i didn't see that. that is pretty cool 
2018-03-19 14:38:44	ajshryoc	Also, just realized the section the he references is also in that Google doc with the feedback 
2018-03-19 15:03:59	jwstanl3	Even after looking at that section, I'm still not sure what he wants us to get from that. The lines he references are where the suits are printed in Crazy Eights to allow the user to select which suit to change to. I don't get how that could be changed. 
2018-03-19 16:30:23	ajshryoc	It could definitely be made better. I think the whole system, crazy eights especially, could benefit from state machines. I intended to cleanup some of that code, but I decided to just wait until this upcoming submission. I'll take a better look at the comments later 
2018-03-19 17:59:01	Jesse	I'm not sure I know how the system could be improved with FSMs. But if you know what you'd like to change, I could definitely help out with that. The issue I see with FSMs is that only crazy eights would use it... and it would just be wasted code for solitaire.

2018-01-23 17:45:08	Jesse	Hello 
2018-01-27 17:50:56	Jesse	we should probably figure out what 2 card games we are going to choose. 
2018-01-27 17:52:53	Jesse	so one has to be some variant of a game which I forgot the name to.. and the other could be anything that involves the standard 52 deck of cards. 
2018-01-27 17:58:05	Jesse	I'm thinking solitaire or some variant of it would be pretty easy to program. 
2018-01-27 18:00:03	Jesse	it wouldnt be as easy as something like blackjack or go fish but those ones are already taken. 
2018-01-27 20:53:36	ajshryoc	I'm cool with solitaire. The game you forgot the name to is Bartok. A Bartok variant I would suggest we annotate would be Crazy Eights. 
2018-01-27 20:54:10	Jesse	im not familiar with either of the two games 
2018-01-27 20:54:36	ajshryoc	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crazy_Eights
2018-01-27 20:54:36		Wikipedia: Crazy Eights
2018-01-27 20:54:36		Crazy Eights is a shedding-type card game for two to seven players. The object of the game is to be the first to get rid of all the player's cards to a discard pile. The game is considered a pre-extension of Switch and Mau Mau.
2018-01-27 20:54:36		A standard 52-card deck is used when there are five or fewer players. When there are more than five players, two decks are shuffled together and all 104 cards are used. 
2018-01-27 20:54:59	ajshryoc	Not familiar with solitaire? Or Bartok? 
2018-01-27 22:25:26	Jesse	bartok and crazy eight. 
2018-01-28 20:18:47	ajshryoc	Bartok is just the game where you have a hand and have to play cards that match a card with the same suit/rank until you run out of cards. Crazy Eights is just that with a couple of other additions, if I remember 
2018-01-28 20:33:54	Jesse	gotcha. well it may make it difficult if we choose a game vastly different from that, so idk if solitaire is a good idea... but I'm sure we could do it if we cant find a better game. 
2018-01-28 20:54:33	ajshryoc	I mean, technically our language should be able to create any kind of game so having two very different games to base it off of might actually be beneficial, although a little more work for the annotation. 
2018-01-28 20:55:28	Jesse	should we call dibs on solitaire then in the proj1 channel? 
2018-01-28 20:57:45	ajshryoc	I'm cool with that 
2018-01-28 21:11:35	ajshryoc	Do we have to claim both games? Or just the non-Bartok clone one? 
2018-01-28 21:12:15	Jesse	i guess juat the non-bartok 
2018-01-28 21:12:27	Jesse	just* 
2018-01-29 17:21:22	Jesse	When can you guys meet up to work on the card game annotations? 
2018-01-29 17:22:08	Jesse	I'm free up until 4:30 on thursday. 
2018-01-29 17:22:23	Jesse	or any time on friday 
2018-01-29 17:30:09	ajshryoc	Between 2 and 4:30 on Thursday works for me 
2018-01-29 17:33:21	Jesse	sounds good to me. 
2018-01-29 17:49:17	jwstanl3	I'm busy 2-6pm pretty much everyday except for Friday 
2018-01-29 17:50:03	Jesse	id be willing to meet up on friday. what about you andrew? 
2018-01-29 17:53:51	ajshryoc	I've got senior design 10:40-12:30 on friday and I typically work afterwards. I could meet before class if that is an option for you guys? Another suggestion would be after class Thursday 
2018-01-29 17:54:37	jwstanl3	I can meet after class Thursday 
2018-01-29 17:54:48	Jesse	Yeah I can do that 
2018-01-29 17:55:25	ajshryoc	Alright, cool 
2018-02-01 20:59:14	Jesse	hey guys, I put in a little bit at the end of the card game annotations. please check if theres anything you'd like to add or modify. 
2018-02-01 21:35:25	ajshryoc	That part looks good and I think was a smart addition 
2018-02-01 21:35:41	Jesse	thank you 
2018-02-01 21:37:41	ajshryoc	I will probably go back to this throughout the weekend if I think of more similarities/differences to add. Overall though, I think it looks good. I probably won't be able to put in a good chunk of time on this assignment until Monday, but I don't think it'll take that long to write out what we already have. 
2018-02-01 21:38:41	Jesse	when you mean write out, do you mean hand-written? 
2018-02-01 21:39:15	ajshryoc	Sorry, I mean like write out in a sentence rather than just a list 
2018-02-01 21:40:00	Jesse	Ahh.. I'm not too sure its important to have it in sentence form, but if you think that would be better, go for it xD 
2018-02-01 21:40:48	Jesse	i can of course help too.. just want to be sure thats something you think is important 
2018-02-01 21:42:56	ajshryoc	I suppose he doesn't really say what format it should be in and only says "list what is similar, what is different", so I'm not entirely sure what he's looking for. I think as long as it's clear we can have it in list form, maybe just with an intro paragraph for each section. 
2018-02-01 21:45:00	Jesse	I don't think he knows what he is looking for lol. And I'm not too sure what I would put in an intro paragraph. 
2018-02-01 23:04:13	ajshryoc	Yeah, good point. We can see how it is and how much time we want to put in next week. 
2018-02-05 21:28:33	ajshryoc	I'm working on the annotations a litte. Just trying to add some more words to the game descriptions. Let me know what you guys think and feel free to add anything 
2018-02-06 19:31:23	ajshryoc	I made a couple small additions to the annotation. Mainly just for formatting/flow. Let me know what you guys think and add whatever else you think we need. If you guys think it's good, I can submit the doc 
2018-02-06 20:39:28	Jesse	ill take a look now. sorry i was distracted 
2018-02-06 20:44:36	Jesse	well dang. thats a lot more of an improvement than i was expecting. Nice work Andrew  
2018-02-06 20:45:22	jwstanl3	Everything looks good 
2018-02-06 20:47:21	Jesse	yeah I agree. 
2018-02-06 20:48:54	Jesse	would you like me to submit? 
2018-02-06 20:49:09	ajshryoc	Thanks, just took what we had before and made it flow a little better  
2018-02-06 20:49:18	ajshryoc	Yeah, go ahead and submit if you want 
2018-02-06 20:50:39	Jesse	done 
2018-02-06 20:50:49	ajshryoc	Sweet 
2018-02-11 09:22:16	Jesse	Hey guys do either of you understand the homework? 
2018-02-11 11:38:18	ajshryoc	I have not taken a look at it so far. I just saw that Alex Phelps posted some tips in #homework that seemed helpful. Will probably get to the homework later today or tomorrow 
2018-02-11 11:49:28	Jesse	yeah. i gotcha 
2018-02-12 21:17:50	ajshryoc	Have you guys finished the homework? I think I've got it---it looks like it's behaving correctly, but I'm not sure what he wants exactly 
2018-02-13 10:43:30	Jesse	I submitted something but I don't think it's right at all. I just made the program look like it was doing something right and submittted it. 
2018-02-13 14:46:06	Jesse	I just pushed  a starter to our cardgame project in our github repo. check it out when ya get the chance. i was just sketching some things up so feel free to modify whatever. 
2018-02-13 15:46:25	ajshryoc	Okay, I'll check it out 
2018-02-14 21:35:45	ajshryoc	@ajshryoc shared a file: https://plm18.slack.com/files/U8M1VEVT3/F98NZUTNC/CSC495_Project_Todo_List (CSC495 Project Todo List) 
2018-02-14 21:35:45		@ajshryoc commented on @ajshryoc?s file https://plm18.slack.com/files/U8M1VEVT3/F98NZUTNC/CSC495_Project_Todo_List (CSC495 Project Todo List): Hey guys, I did a little design work on an approach I've thought of for implementing the two games based on some stuff we've talked about in class. I mainly just tried to break down the game object that were suggested we use in class in the context of a finite state machine. Let me know what you think and if you have suggestions/feedback. We could then write this up as GitHub issues. That way, we can assign things as tasks. 
2018-02-14 21:42:45	Jesse	thats a pretty solid writeup. I'll spend some more time looking over it later.  I think the most complex thing is going to be implementing rules and goals since they can vary  a lot from game to game. 
2018-02-14 21:44:58	ajshryoc	I agree. That along with what constitutes a valid move---especially with solitaire. 
2018-02-15 14:40:27	Jesse	hey guys, i'm gonna be late to class today. I've got a video call with the people i'll be interning with from 3:30 to 4:30. 
2018-02-16 00:07:50	ajshryoc	added an integration to this channel: https://plm18.slack.com/services/B9A0YJ9V1 (github) 
2018-02-16 00:12:00	ajshryoc	I've converted the list I wrote up yesterday into a few GitHub issues. Please feel free to take a look and modify if you see fit. With these we can more easily divide up tasks (or subtasks) and tag commits/branches with them. I also added the GitHub app to this channel, which will post when events happen on the repo. If it starts to get annoying, I can reduce the notifications or turn it off. Figured I'd give it a shot and see if it's useful for keeping everyone up to date on code changes 
2018-02-16 10:06:31	Jesse	I'll start working on this tomorrow. I'm dedicating today to English 331 and research. thanks for this Andrew. [:+1:1] 
2018-02-17 12:56:28	Jesse	I'm gonna be working on this project starting now. I'll try to document my work here. I'm willing to meet up at Hunt if you guys are interested, but it's not necessary. 
2018-02-17 13:04:31	ajshryoc	Sweet. I may work on this depending on how quickly I can do my networks homework today.  
2018-02-17 13:07:13	Jesse	Ok. I'm gonna be looking more into higher level design aspects rather than implementation. I'll let you know what I find. [:+1:1] 
2018-02-17 14:19:00	Jesse	I think I've worked out most of the ambiguous stuff. i can try to upload my notes but it is quite illegible, so ill have to meet with you guys some time to explain.
2018-02-17 14:19:00		Once I work out the rest of the thinking stuff, Ill try to lay out what needs to be done in the form of  a informal UML diagram. From there, I'm going to give out some tasks as far as implementation of this UML. 
2018-02-17 14:19:00		this is my goal for today.

2018-02-17 17:47:30	ajshryoc	Hey @jwstanl3, which one of the two games would you like to work on?

2018-02-19 10:14:55	Jesse	I dont think I updated you guys on what I did in that commit. I implemented the basic structure and started on the solitaire UI. I left the rulebook and other game specific things unimplemented. I would also like to expand the basic structures functionality to things like flipping over a card or moving sets of cards from one pile to another pile. 
2018-02-19 17:12:34	ajshryoc	Yeah, added functionality like that would be great. I'm not sure how difficult it would be, but it would be cool if the Pile class was iterable so that you could use it in a for loop. If it too complicated to add that don't worry about it

2018-02-19 21:24:57	Jesse	I added functionality for piles giving one card or giving a set of cards. [:+1:1]

2018-02-19 21:56:00	Jesse	the UI for solitaire is starting to look good. 
2018-02-19 21:56:28	ajshryoc	Yeah, nice! 
2018-02-19 22:03:59	Jesse	I'm not gonna lie, the base code is a lil messy, so if theres any general features that you think needs to be in there just let me know and I can implement it. 
2018-02-19 22:04:46	Jesse	as for the UI, I'm making it so you guys just pass in a set of piles. and the index in the set of piles will determine which pile is positioned where. 
2018-02-19 22:05:46	Jesse	I also hardcoded the height of the board since we know that there will be no higher stack of cards than 13 (which is Ace-King) in solitaire 
2018-02-19 22:07:38	ajshryoc	That would be pretty sweet if we just have to pass in the piles. I think it looks pretty good. We can worry about code cleanup later too. 
2018-02-19 22:09:08	ajshryoc	I was able to get crazy eights working with just 1 player playing cards on the pile, so it looks like we're in a pretty good spot for this project 
2018-02-19 22:09:23	Jesse	dang really? thats pretty awesome 
2018-02-19 22:10:43	ajshryoc	It'll be a cool project once it's all working. The way we have it setup (with your cards.py objects) made it pretty straightforward to program 
2018-02-19 22:10:45	Jesse	can you tell me what the board would look like for crazy eight? is it just a pile for taking cards and a pile for laying cards? also displaying the hand to the player? 
2018-02-19 22:13:53	ajshryoc	@ajshryoc uploaded a file: https://plm18.slack.com/files/U8M1VEVT3/F9ATPNWBS/crazyeights.jpg (crazyeights.JPG) and commented: Here's what I've been using as a sort of debug UI.  So, there's the pile for taking cards, pile for playing cards, and the player's hand. I'm unsure how to handle the computer players since the number of card they hold is definitely relevant to the player. 
2018-02-19 22:14:54	ajshryoc	I think just listing the AI players and showing how many face down cards are in their hands on different lines would be good enough 
2018-02-19 22:16:20	ajshryoc	As a side note, I defined a Move as a Crazy Eights specific object (although it might be worth pulling out) that is defined by a Card, a "to" Pile, and a "from" Pile. It has a method called "make" that will remove the Card from "from" Pile and add it to "to" Pile. This kinda thing might be useful for solitaire too  (edited)
2018-02-19 22:17:59	Jesse	oh. I made a similar function in my Pile class (giveOneCard) 
2018-02-19 22:19:01	ajshryoc	No problem, that totally works. I'll adjust what I've got to match your code once I pull it in 
2018-02-19 22:19:20	Jesse	Would you guys be willing to meet up tomorrow so that we can clean up our code? / continue developing? 
2018-02-19 22:19:32	Jesse	I'm good all day except class time 
2018-02-19 22:20:10	ajshryoc	I'm good from around 1:30 to class time

2018-02-20 07:46:29	jwstanl3	Would you guys be able to meet after class? I have a class from 1:30-2:45 and then I tutor from 3-4 
2018-02-20 10:30:28	Jesse	Yeah. Would you be able to meet after class andrew? I don't think we need a lot of time. My plan was just to use an hour or two to clean up some of the code in the generic game structure/UI's and implement any functionality you guys think would be good for both games. 
2018-02-20 10:32:21	Jesse	If not, I could meet with andrew an hour before class and then after class with Joseph for an hour.

2018-02-20 13:05:32	Jesse	thats awesome!! but arent the red cards supposed to go on black cards and vice versa? 
2018-02-20 13:05:45	Jesse	its okay if we want to change it for the sake of project scope 
2018-02-20 13:05:53	Jesse	to be red on red 
2018-02-20 13:08:42	jwstanl3	The rules from Bicycle didn't have any restrictions on color. It just had to be consecutive. But, yea, normally you would alternate colors, and it would be pretty easy to switch the program to follow that. 
2018-02-20 13:09:15	jwstanl3	The game's really easy at the moment, so adding something like that would help it be more challenging.

2018-02-21 20:28:57	jwstanl3	I pushed some fixes to my solitaire code. Cards have to alternate in color now in the stacks. There were a few other bugs I fixed. I still haven't added a win state, or a loss state really, but it should be able to detect a win or loss, if the loss state doesn't have any moves left. I haven't been able to beat the game since adding the alternating colors, so I'm not sure if this is true or not.

2018-02-22 22:08:38	ajshryoc	Added what I have for crazy eights. I think the only major feature missing is the suit change when playing an 8. I also intend to clean up the code and little bit to get rid of redundancy.  (edited)
2018-02-22 22:12:02	Jesse	great!! I'll probably take a look some time this weekend

2018-02-24 12:28:32	Jesse	Do you guys understand python decorators? I haven't been able to reproduce a function that demonstrates the difference with/without the decorator. 
2018-02-25 20:28:31	ajshryoc	Sorry, intended to respond, then totally forgot about this. My understanding of python decorators is it's just another form of syntax for calling functions; however, it sort of ties two functions together and modifies the function being decorated. Here's an article I found that gives a good explanation on the subject: http://python-3-patterns-idioms-test.readthedocs.io/en/latest/PythonDecorators.html

2018-02-25 22:39:22	ajshryoc	Just pushed the finished version of Crazy Eights. It's kinda a mess, so I'll probably do some refactoring of it at some point. I also modified cards.py to print out the unicode symbol corresponding to the card's suit. I was curious about how to do it and it turned out to be really easy, so I added it. I think it makes it much easier to see the cards 
2018-02-25 22:41:04	Jesse	oh nice!!! let me know if theres anything youd like me to change.  
2018-02-26 13:50:38	Jesse	I played both crazy eights and solitaire and I haven't noticed any bugs. winning looks good as well. 
2018-02-26 13:52:31	Jesse	we may be able to polish a few things up but honestly, it doesn't matter too much because we'll be taking parts of our code out and re implementing stuff for the second submission. I think what we have is gold. If there's anything you guys want me to change, just let me know. 
2018-02-26 17:12:29	ajshryoc	Glad you liked it! I think they both play pretty well 
2018-03-12 13:07:36	Jesse	Hey guys, we need to figure out what we need to submit and submit it before class tomorrow. 
2018-03-12 13:11:03	Jesse	Do you guys have the transcript of the 2 games? if not I can make them. 
2018-03-12 13:12:50	ajshryoc	I don't have a transcript. You should be able to use the tee command to output to a file and stdout 
2018-03-12 13:13:04	Jesse	I was just gonna use script 
2018-03-12 13:13:18	Jesse	it automatically outputs the log to a file 
2018-03-12 13:13:31	ajshryoc	Yeah, whatever works 
2018-03-12 13:13:53	Jesse	alright.

2018-03-12 14:41:24	Jesse	Alright, the transcripts are made. Can someone else do the work of submitting and making a cheap readme with some basic information like linking to the transcript file and how to run each of the games?

2018-03-16 10:06:54	Jesse	I'm gonna take a look now about what we can do to our project for submission 3. 
2018-03-16 10:13:12	Jesse	Nobody but me used cardsTest.py right? would you guys mind if I deleted that file? 
2018-03-16 10:17:46	Jesse	We may want to ask the professor about this... I worry our games are too different. 
2018-03-17 00:11:58	ajshryoc	You can delete cardsTest.py if no one is using it. I would probably make a new directory in the git repo called 'project3' or something so that we have a record of both of our submissions. As for the issues with the games, if you want to ask him, go ahead. I think we could make it work but I'm sure he could provide some insight. <--- Sorry typed this up about 14 hours ago and never hit send 
2018-03-19 14:19:24	Jesse	We got a 90% it seems on what we submitted for the project. He said he liked our nouns/verbs but was disappointed that we didn't make an FSM. He also linked "Derive Interfaces from Constraints of Data" as if its some reading on moodle or github. 
2018-03-19 14:19:57	Jesse	... I checked both, and I'm not sure what he's talking about 
2018-03-19 14:36:38	ajshryoc	I'm also unsure what he meant by that. Our design did get a shoutout in #proj2_mar1 though so that's pretty cool 
2018-03-19 14:38:04	Jesse	i didn't see that. that is pretty cool 
2018-03-19 14:38:44	ajshryoc	Also, just realized the section the he references is also in that Google doc with the feedback 
2018-03-19 15:03:59	jwstanl3	Even after looking at that section, I'm still not sure what he wants us to get from that. The lines he references are where the suits are printed in Crazy Eights to allow the user to select which suit to change to. I don't get how that could be changed. 
2018-03-19 16:30:23	ajshryoc	It could definitely be made better. I think the whole system, crazy eights especially, could benefit from state machines. I intended to cleanup some of that code, but I decided to just wait until this upcoming submission. I'll take a better look at the comments later 
2018-03-19 17:59:01	Jesse	I'm not sure I know how the system could be improved with FSMs. But if you know what you'd like to change, I could definitely help out with that. The issue I see with FSMs is that only crazy eights would use it... and it would just be wasted code for solitaire. 
2018-03-19 19:10:58	ajshryoc	I'm sure he'll provide more context tomorrow. I'll review their comments too and we can go from there

2018-01-23 17:45:08	Jesse	Hello 
2018-01-27 17:50:56	Jesse	we should probably figure out what 2 card games we are going to choose. 
2018-01-27 17:52:53	Jesse	so one has to be some variant of a game which I forgot the name to.. and the other could be anything that involves the standard 52 deck of cards. 
2018-01-27 17:58:05	Jesse	I'm thinking solitaire or some variant of it would be pretty easy to program. 
2018-01-27 18:00:03	Jesse	it wouldnt be as easy as something like blackjack or go fish but those ones are already taken. 
2018-01-27 20:53:36	ajshryoc	I'm cool with solitaire. The game you forgot the name to is Bartok. A Bartok variant I would suggest we annotate would be Crazy Eights. 
2018-01-27 20:54:10	Jesse	im not familiar with either of the two games 
2018-01-27 20:54:36	ajshryoc	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crazy_Eights
2018-01-27 20:54:36		Wikipedia: Crazy Eights
2018-01-27 20:54:36		Crazy Eights is a shedding-type card game for two to seven players. The object of the game is to be the first to get rid of all the player's cards to a discard pile. The game is considered a pre-extension of Switch and Mau Mau.
2018-01-27 20:54:36		A standard 52-card deck is used when there are five or fewer players. When there are more than five players, two decks are shuffled together and all 104 cards are used. 
2018-01-27 20:54:59	ajshryoc	Not familiar with solitaire? Or Bartok? 
2018-01-27 22:25:26	Jesse	bartok and crazy eight. 
2018-01-28 20:18:47	ajshryoc	Bartok is just the game where you have a hand and have to play cards that match a card with the same suit/rank until you run out of cards. Crazy Eights is just that with a couple of other additions, if I remember 
2018-01-28 20:33:54	Jesse	gotcha. well it may make it difficult if we choose a game vastly different from that, so idk if solitaire is a good idea... but I'm sure we could do it if we cant find a better game. 
2018-01-28 20:54:33	ajshryoc	I mean, technically our language should be able to create any kind of game so having two very different games to base it off of might actually be beneficial, although a little more work for the annotation. 
2018-01-28 20:55:28	Jesse	should we call dibs on solitaire then in the proj1 channel? 
2018-01-28 20:57:45	ajshryoc	I'm cool with that 
2018-01-28 21:11:35	ajshryoc	Do we have to claim both games? Or just the non-Bartok clone one? 
2018-01-28 21:12:15	Jesse	i guess juat the non-bartok 
2018-01-28 21:12:27	Jesse	just* 
2018-01-29 17:21:22	Jesse	When can you guys meet up to work on the card game annotations? 
2018-01-29 17:22:08	Jesse	I'm free up until 4:30 on thursday. 
2018-01-29 17:22:23	Jesse	or any time on friday 
2018-01-29 17:30:09	ajshryoc	Between 2 and 4:30 on Thursday works for me 
2018-01-29 17:33:21	Jesse	sounds good to me. 
2018-01-29 17:49:17	jwstanl3	I'm busy 2-6pm pretty much everyday except for Friday 
2018-01-29 17:50:03	Jesse	id be willing to meet up on friday. what about you andrew? 
2018-01-29 17:53:51	ajshryoc	I've got senior design 10:40-12:30 on friday and I typically work afterwards. I could meet before class if that is an option for you guys? Another suggestion would be after class Thursday 
2018-01-29 17:54:37	jwstanl3	I can meet after class Thursday 
2018-01-29 17:54:48	Jesse	Yeah I can do that 
2018-01-29 17:55:25	ajshryoc	Alright, cool 
2018-02-01 20:59:14	Jesse	hey guys, I put in a little bit at the end of the card game annotations. please check if theres anything you'd like to add or modify. 
2018-02-01 21:35:25	ajshryoc	That part looks good and I think was a smart addition 
2018-02-01 21:35:41	Jesse	thank you 
2018-02-01 21:37:41	ajshryoc	I will probably go back to this throughout the weekend if I think of more similarities/differences to add. Overall though, I think it looks good. I probably won't be able to put in a good chunk of time on this assignment until Monday, but I don't think it'll take that long to write out what we already have. 
2018-02-01 21:38:41	Jesse	when you mean write out, do you mean hand-written? 
2018-02-01 21:39:15	ajshryoc	Sorry, I mean like write out in a sentence rather than just a list 
2018-02-01 21:40:00	Jesse	Ahh.. I'm not too sure its important to have it in sentence form, but if you think that would be better, go for it xD 
2018-02-01 21:40:48	Jesse	i can of course help too.. just want to be sure thats something you think is important 
2018-02-01 21:42:56	ajshryoc	I suppose he doesn't really say what format it should be in and only says "list what is similar, what is different", so I'm not entirely sure what he's looking for. I think as long as it's clear we can have it in list form, maybe just with an intro paragraph for each section. 
2018-02-01 21:45:00	Jesse	I don't think he knows what he is looking for lol. And I'm not too sure what I would put in an intro paragraph. 
2018-02-01 23:04:13	ajshryoc	Yeah, good point. We can see how it is and how much time we want to put in next week. 
2018-02-05 21:28:33	ajshryoc	I'm working on the annotations a litte. Just trying to add some more words to the game descriptions. Let me know what you guys think and feel free to add anything 
2018-02-06 19:31:23	ajshryoc	I made a couple small additions to the annotation. Mainly just for formatting/flow. Let me know what you guys think and add whatever else you think we need. If you guys think it's good, I can submit the doc 
2018-02-06 20:39:28	Jesse	ill take a look now. sorry i was distracted 
2018-02-06 20:44:36	Jesse	well dang. thats a lot more of an improvement than i was expecting. Nice work Andrew  
2018-02-06 20:45:22	jwstanl3	Everything looks good 
2018-02-06 20:47:21	Jesse	yeah I agree. 
2018-02-06 20:48:54	Jesse	would you like me to submit? 
2018-02-06 20:49:09	ajshryoc	Thanks, just took what we had before and made it flow a little better  
2018-02-06 20:49:18	ajshryoc	Yeah, go ahead and submit if you want 
2018-02-06 20:50:39	Jesse	done 
2018-02-06 20:50:49	ajshryoc	Sweet 
2018-02-11 09:22:16	Jesse	Hey guys do either of you understand the homework? 
2018-02-11 11:38:18	ajshryoc	I have not taken a look at it so far. I just saw that Alex Phelps posted some tips in #homework that seemed helpful. Will probably get to the homework later today or tomorrow 
2018-02-11 11:49:28	Jesse	yeah. i gotcha 
2018-02-12 21:17:50	ajshryoc	Have you guys finished the homework? I think I've got it---it looks like it's behaving correctly, but I'm not sure what he wants exactly 
2018-02-13 10:43:30	Jesse	I submitted something but I don't think it's right at all. I just made the program look like it was doing something right and submittted it. 
2018-02-13 14:46:06	Jesse	I just pushed  a starter to our cardgame project in our github repo. check it out when ya get the chance. i was just sketching some things up so feel free to modify whatever. 
2018-02-13 15:46:25	ajshryoc	Okay, I'll check it out

2018-02-14 21:35:45		@ajshryoc commented on @ajshryoc?s file https://plm18.slack.com/files/U8M1VEVT3/F98NZUTNC/CSC495_Project_Todo_List (CSC495 Project Todo List): Hey guys, I did a little design work on an approach I've thought of for implementing the two games based on some stuff we've talked about in class. I mainly just tried to break down the game object that were suggested we use in class in the context of a finite state machine. Let me know what you think and if you have suggestions/feedback. We could then write this up as GitHub issues. That way, we can assign things as tasks. 
2018-02-14 21:42:45	Jesse	thats a pretty solid writeup. I'll spend some more time looking over it later.  I think the most complex thing is going to be implementing rules and goals since they can vary  a lot from game to game. 
2018-02-14 21:44:58	ajshryoc	I agree. That along with what constitutes a valid move---especially with solitaire. 
2018-02-15 14:40:27	Jesse	hey guys, i'm gonna be late to class today. I've got a video call with the people i'll be interning with from 3:30 to 4:30.

With these we can more easily divide up tasks (or subtasks) and tag commits/branches with them. I also added the GitHub app to this channel, which will post when events happen on the repo. If it starts to get annoying, I can reduce the notifications or turn it off. Figured I'd give it a shot and see if it's useful for keeping everyone up to date on code changes 
2018-02-16 10:06:31	Jesse	I'll start working on this tomorrow. I'm dedicating today to English 331 and research. thanks for this Andrew. [:+1:1] 
2018-02-17 12:56:28	Jesse	I'm gonna be working on this project starting now. I'll try to document my work here. I'm willing to meet up at Hunt if you guys are interested, but it's not necessary. 
2018-02-17 13:04:31	ajshryoc	Sweet. I may work on this depending on how quickly I can do my networks homework today.  
2018-02-17 13:07:13	Jesse	Ok. I'm gonna be looking more into higher level design aspects rather than implementation. I'll let you know what I find. [:+1:1] 
2018-02-17 14:19:00	Jesse	I think I've worked out most of the ambiguous stuff. i can try to upload my notes but it is quite illegible, so ill have to meet with you guys some time to explain.
2018-02-17 14:19:00		Once I work out the rest of the thinking stuff, Ill try to lay out what needs to be done in the form of  a informal UML diagram. From there, I'm going to give out some tasks as far as implementation of this UML. 
2018-02-17 14:19:00		this is my goal for today.

2018-02-17 17:47:09	Jesse	Hey guys, I pushed my UML diagram. Tomorrow I'll handle some of the basic classes like hand, pile, deck and whatever. I also assigned myself to the UI task. 
2018-02-17 17:47:30	ajshryoc	Hey @jwstanl3, which one of the two games would you like to work on? 
2018-02-17 20:14:45	jwstanl3	I'll look into Solitaire. Sorry for taking so long to reply.

2018-02-19 10:14:55	Jesse	I dont think I updated you guys on what I did in that commit. I implemented the basic structure and started on the solitaire UI. I left the rulebook and other game specific things unimplemented. I would also like to expand the basic structures functionality to things like flipping over a card or moving sets of cards from one pile to another pile. 
2018-02-19 17:12:34	ajshryoc	Yeah, added functionality like that would be great. I'm not sure how difficult it would be, but it would be cool if the Pile class was iterable so that you could use it in a for loop. If it too complicated to add that don't worry about it

2018-02-19 21:24:57	Jesse	I added functionality for piles giving one card or giving a set of cards. [:+1:1]

2018-02-19 21:56:00	Jesse	the UI for solitaire is starting to look good. 
2018-02-19 21:56:28	ajshryoc	Yeah, nice! 
2018-02-19 22:03:59	Jesse	I'm not gonna lie, the base code is a lil messy, so if theres any general features that you think needs to be in there just let me know and I can implement it. 
2018-02-19 22:04:46	Jesse	as for the UI, I'm making it so you guys just pass in a set of piles. and the index in the set of piles will determine which pile is positioned where. 
2018-02-19 22:05:46	Jesse	I also hardcoded the height of the board since we know that there will be no higher stack of cards than 13 (which is Ace-King) in solitaire 
2018-02-19 22:07:38	ajshryoc	That would be pretty sweet if we just have to pass in the piles. I think it looks pretty good. We can worry about code cleanup later too. 
2018-02-19 22:09:08	ajshryoc	I was able to get crazy eights working with just 1 player playing cards on the pile, so it looks like we're in a pretty good spot for this project 
2018-02-19 22:09:23	Jesse	dang really? thats pretty awesome 
2018-02-19 22:10:43	ajshryoc	It'll be a cool project once it's all working. The way we have it setup (with your cards.py objects) made it pretty straightforward to program 
2018-02-19 22:10:45	Jesse	can you tell me what the board would look like for crazy eight? is it just a pile for taking cards and a pile for laying cards? also displaying the hand to the player? 
2018-02-19 22:13:53	ajshryoc	@ajshryoc uploaded a file: https://plm18.slack.com/files/U8M1VEVT3/F9ATPNWBS/crazyeights.jpg (crazyeights.JPG) and commented: Here's what I've been using as a sort of debug UI.  So, there's the pile for taking cards, pile for playing cards, and the player's hand. I'm unsure how to handle the computer players since the number of card they hold is definitely relevant to the player. 
2018-02-19 22:14:54	ajshryoc	I think just listing the AI players and showing how many face down cards are in their hands on different lines would be good enough 
2018-02-19 22:16:20	ajshryoc	As a side note, I defined a Move as a Crazy Eights specific object (although it might be worth pulling out) that is defined by a Card, a "to" Pile, and a "from" Pile. It has a method called "make" that will remove the Card from "from" Pile and add it to "to" Pile. This kinda thing might be useful for solitaire too  (edited)
2018-02-19 22:17:59	Jesse	oh. I made a similar function in my Pile class (giveOneCard) 
2018-02-19 22:19:01	ajshryoc	No problem, that totally works. I'll adjust what I've got to match your code once I pull it in 
2018-02-19 22:19:20	Jesse	Would you guys be willing to meet up tomorrow so that we can clean up our code? / continue developing? 
2018-02-19 22:19:32	Jesse	I'm good all day except class time 
2018-02-19 22:20:10	ajshryoc	I'm good from around 1:30 to class time

2018-02-20 10:30:28	Jesse	Yeah. Would you be able to meet after class andrew? I don't think we need a lot of time. My plan was just to use an hour or two to clean up some of the code in the generic game structure/UI's and implement any functionality you guys think would be good for both games. 
2018-02-20 10:32:21	Jesse	If not, I could meet with andrew an hour before class and then after class with Joseph for an hour.

2018-02-20 13:05:32	Jesse	thats awesome!! but arent the red cards supposed to go on black cards and vice versa? 
2018-02-20 13:05:45	Jesse	its okay if we want to change it for the sake of project scope 
2018-02-20 13:05:53	Jesse	to be red on red 
2018-02-20 13:08:42	jwstanl3	The rules from Bicycle didn't have any restrictions on color. It just had to be consecutive. But, yea, normally you would alternate colors, and it would be pretty easy to switch the program to follow that. 
2018-02-20 13:09:15	jwstanl3	The game's really easy at the moment, so adding something like that would help it be more challenging.

2018-02-21 20:28:57	jwstanl3	I pushed some fixes to my solitaire code. Cards have to alternate in color now in the stacks. There were a few other bugs I fixed. I still haven't added a win state, or a loss state really, but it should be able to detect a win or loss, if the loss state doesn't have any moves left. I haven't been able to beat the game since adding the alternating colors, so I'm not sure if this is true or not.

2018-02-25 20:28:31	ajshryoc	Sorry, intended to respond, then totally forgot about this. My understanding of python decorators is it's just another form of syntax for calling functions; however, it sort of ties two functions together and modifies the function being decorated. Here's an article I found that gives a good explanation on the subject: http://python-3-patterns-idioms-test.readthedocs.io/en/latest/PythonDecorators.html

2018-02-25 22:39:22	ajshryoc	Just pushed the finished version of Crazy Eights. It's kinda a mess, so I'll probably do some refactoring of it at some point. I also modified cards.py to print out the unicode symbol corresponding to the card's suit. I was curious about how to do it and it turned out to be really easy, so I added it. I think it makes it much easier to see the cards 
2018-02-25 22:41:04	Jesse	oh nice!!! let me know if theres anything youd like me to change.  
2018-02-26 13:50:38	Jesse	I played both crazy eights and solitaire and I haven't noticed any bugs. winning looks good as well. 
2018-02-26 13:52:31	Jesse	we may be able to polish a few things up but honestly, it doesn't matter too much because we'll be taking parts of our code out and re implementing stuff for the second submission.

As for the issues with the games, if you want to ask him, go ahead. I think we could make it work but I'm sure he could provide some insight. <--- Sorry typed this up about 14 hours ago and never hit send 
2018-03-19 14:19:24	Jesse	We got a 90% it seems on what we submitted for the project. He said he liked our nouns/verbs but was disappointed that we didn't make an FSM. He also linked "Derive Interfaces from Constraints of Data" as if its some reading on moodle or github. 
2018-03-19 14:19:57	Jesse	... I checked both, and I'm not sure what he's talking about 
2018-03-19 14:36:38	ajshryoc	I'm also unsure what he meant by that. Our design did get a shoutout in #proj2_mar1 though so that's pretty cool 
2018-03-19 14:38:04	Jesse	i didn't see that. that is pretty cool 
2018-03-19 14:38:44	ajshryoc	Also, just realized the section the he references is also in that Google doc with the feedback 
2018-03-19 15:03:59	jwstanl3	Even after looking at that section, I'm still not sure what he wants us to get from that. The lines he references are where the suits are printed in Crazy Eights to allow the user to select which suit to change to. I don't get how that could be changed. 
2018-03-19 16:30:23	ajshryoc	It could definitely be made better. I think the whole system, crazy eights especially, could benefit from state machines. I intended to cleanup some of that code, but I decided to just wait until this upcoming submission. I'll take a better look at the comments later 
2018-03-19 17:59:01	Jesse	I'm not sure I know how the system could be improved with FSMs. But if you know what you'd like to change, I could definitely help out with that. The issue I see with FSMs is that only crazy eights would use it... and it would just be wasted code for solitaire. 
2018-03-19 19:10:58	ajshryoc	I'm sure he'll provide more context tomorrow. I'll review their comments too and we can go from there 
2018-03-20 10:11:37	Jesse	Hey guys, I was checking out a few other peoples code, and i found one where they built the FSM setup stuff, and didn't call it anywhere in their code xD. I wonder if the graders caught it.

2018-01-23 17:45:00	jwstanl3	@jwstanl3 has joined the group 
2018-01-23 17:45:08	Jesse	Hello 
2018-01-27 17:50:56	Jesse	we should probably figure out what 2 card games we are going to choose. 
2018-01-27 17:52:53	Jesse	so one has to be some variant of a game which I forgot the name to.. and the other could be anything that involves the standard 52 deck of cards. 
2018-01-27 17:58:05	Jesse	I'm thinking solitaire or some variant of it would be pretty easy to program. 
2018-01-27 18:00:03	Jesse	it wouldnt be as easy as something like blackjack or go fish but those ones are already taken. 
2018-01-27 20:53:36	ajshryoc	I'm cool with solitaire. The game you forgot the name to is Bartok. A Bartok variant I would suggest we annotate would be Crazy Eights. 
2018-01-27 20:54:10	Jesse	im not familiar with either of the two games 
2018-01-27 20:54:36	ajshryoc	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crazy_Eights
2018-01-27 20:54:36		Wikipedia: Crazy Eights
2018-01-27 20:54:36		Crazy Eights is a shedding-type card game for two to seven players. The object of the game is to be the first to get rid of all the player's cards to a discard pile. The game is considered a pre-extension of Switch and Mau Mau.
2018-01-27 20:54:36		A standard 52-card deck is used when there are five or fewer players. When there are more than five players, two decks are shuffled together and all 104 cards are used. 
2018-01-27 20:54:59	ajshryoc	Not familiar with solitaire? Or Bartok? 
2018-01-27 22:25:26	Jesse	bartok and crazy eight. 
2018-01-28 20:18:47	ajshryoc	Bartok is just the game where you have a hand and have to play cards that match a card with the same suit/rank until you run out of cards. Crazy Eights is just that with a couple of other additions, if I remember 
2018-01-28 20:33:54	Jesse	gotcha. well it may make it difficult if we choose a game vastly different from that, so idk if solitaire is a good idea... but I'm sure we could do it if we cant find a better game. 
2018-01-28 20:54:33	ajshryoc	I mean, technically our language should be able to create any kind of game so having two very different games to base it off of might actually be beneficial, although a little more work for the annotation. 
2018-01-28 20:55:28	Jesse	should we call dibs on solitaire then in the proj1 channel? 
2018-01-28 20:57:45	ajshryoc	I'm cool with that 
2018-01-28 21:11:35	ajshryoc	Do we have to claim both games? Or just the non-Bartok clone one? 
2018-01-28 21:12:15	Jesse	i guess juat the non-bartok 
2018-01-28 21:12:27	Jesse	just* 
2018-01-29 17:21:22	Jesse	When can you guys meet up to work on the card game annotations? 
2018-01-29 17:22:08	Jesse	I'm free up until 4:30 on thursday. 
2018-01-29 17:22:23	Jesse	or any time on friday 
2018-01-29 17:30:09	ajshryoc	Between 2 and 4:30 on Thursday works for me 
2018-01-29 17:33:21	Jesse	sounds good to me. 
2018-01-29 17:49:17	jwstanl3	I'm busy 2-6pm pretty much everyday except for Friday 
2018-01-29 17:50:03	Jesse	id be willing to meet up on friday. what about you andrew? 
2018-01-29 17:53:51	ajshryoc	I've got senior design 10:40-12:30 on friday and I typically work afterwards. I could meet before class if that is an option for you guys? Another suggestion would be after class Thursday 
2018-01-29 17:54:37	jwstanl3	I can meet after class Thursday 
2018-01-29 17:54:48	Jesse	Yeah I can do that 
2018-01-29 17:55:25	ajshryoc	Alright, cool 
2018-02-01 20:59:14	Jesse	hey guys, I put in a little bit at the end of the card game annotations. please check if theres anything you'd like to add or modify. 
2018-02-01 21:35:25	ajshryoc	That part looks good and I think was a smart addition 
2018-02-01 21:35:41	Jesse	thank you 
2018-02-01 21:37:41	ajshryoc	I will probably go back to this throughout the weekend if I think of more similarities/differences to add. Overall though, I think it looks good. I probably won't be able to put in a good chunk of time on this assignment until Monday, but I don't think it'll take that long to write out what we already have. 
2018-02-01 21:38:41	Jesse	when you mean write out, do you mean hand-written? 
2018-02-01 21:39:15	ajshryoc	Sorry, I mean like write out in a sentence rather than just a list 
2018-02-01 21:40:00	Jesse	Ahh.. I'm not too sure its important to have it in sentence form, but if you think that would be better, go for it xD 
2018-02-01 21:40:48	Jesse	i can of course help too.. just want to be sure thats something you think is important 
2018-02-01 21:42:56	ajshryoc	I suppose he doesn't really say what format it should be in and only says "list what is similar, what is different", so I'm not entirely sure what he's looking for. I think as long as it's clear we can have it in list form, maybe just with an intro paragraph for each section. 
2018-02-01 21:45:00	Jesse	I don't think he knows what he is looking for lol. And I'm not too sure what I would put in an intro paragraph. 
2018-02-01 23:04:13	ajshryoc	Yeah, good point. We can see how it is and how much time we want to put in next week. 
2018-02-05 21:28:33	ajshryoc	I'm working on the annotations a litte. Just trying to add some more words to the game descriptions. Let me know what you guys think and feel free to add anything 
2018-02-06 19:31:23	ajshryoc	I made a couple small additions to the annotation. Mainly just for formatting/flow. Let me know what you guys think and add whatever else you think we need. If you guys think it's good, I can submit the doc 
2018-02-06 20:39:28	Jesse	ill take a look now. sorry i was distracted 
2018-02-06 20:44:36	Jesse	well dang. thats a lot more of an improvement than i was expecting. Nice work Andrew  
2018-02-06 20:45:22	jwstanl3	Everything looks good 
2018-02-06 20:47:21	Jesse	yeah I agree. 
2018-02-06 20:48:54	Jesse	would you like me to submit? 
2018-02-06 20:49:09	ajshryoc	Thanks, just took what we had before and made it flow a little better  
2018-02-06 20:49:18	ajshryoc	Yeah, go ahead and submit if you want 
2018-02-06 20:50:39	Jesse	done 
2018-02-06 20:50:49	ajshryoc	Sweet 
2018-02-11 09:22:16	Jesse	Hey guys do either of you understand the homework? 
2018-02-11 11:38:18	ajshryoc	I have not taken a look at it so far. I just saw that Alex Phelps posted some tips in #homework that seemed helpful. Will probably get to the homework later today or tomorrow 
2018-02-11 11:49:28	Jesse	yeah. i gotcha 
2018-02-12 21:17:50	ajshryoc	Have you guys finished the homework? I think I've got it---it looks like it's behaving correctly, but I'm not sure what he wants exactly 
2018-02-13 10:43:30	Jesse	I submitted something but I don't think it's right at all. I just made the program look like it was doing something right and submittted it. 
2018-02-13 14:46:06	Jesse	I just pushed  a starter to our cardgame project in our github repo. check it out when ya get the chance. i was just sketching some things up so feel free to modify whatever. 
2018-02-13 15:46:25	ajshryoc	Okay, I'll check it out 
2018-02-14 21:35:45	ajshryoc	@ajshryoc shared a file: https://plm18.slack.com/files/U8M1VEVT3/F98NZUTNC/CSC495_Project_Todo_List (CSC495 Project Todo List) 
2018-02-14 21:35:45		@ajshryoc commented on @ajshryoc?s file https://plm18.slack.com/files/U8M1VEVT3/F98NZUTNC/CSC495_Project_Todo_List (CSC495 Project Todo List): Hey guys, I did a little design work on an approach I've thought of for implementing the two games based on some stuff we've talked about in class. I mainly just tried to break down the game object that were suggested we use in class in the context of a finite state machine. Let me know what you think and if you have suggestions/feedback. We could then write this up as GitHub issues. That way, we can assign things as tasks. 
2018-02-14 21:42:45	Jesse	thats a pretty solid writeup. I'll spend some more time looking over it later.  I think the most complex thing is going to be implementing rules and goals since they can vary  a lot from game to game. 
2018-02-14 21:44:58	ajshryoc	I agree. That along with what constitutes a valid move---especially with solitaire. 
2018-02-15 14:40:27	Jesse	hey guys, i'm gonna be late to class today. I've got a video call with the people i'll be interning with from 3:30 to 4:30. 
2018-02-16 00:07:50	ajshryoc	added an integration to this channel: https://plm18.slack.com/services/B9A0YJ9V1 (github) 
2018-02-16 00:12:00	ajshryoc	I've converted the list I wrote up yesterday into a few GitHub issues. Please feel free to take a look and modify if you see fit. With these we can more easily divide up tasks (or subtasks) and tag commits/branches with them. I also added the GitHub app to this channel, which will post when events happen on the repo. If it starts to get annoying, I can reduce the notifications or turn it off. Figured I'd give it a shot and see if it's useful for keeping everyone up to date on code changes 
2018-02-16 10:06:31	Jesse	I'll start working on this tomorrow. I'm dedicating today to English 331 and research. thanks for this Andrew. [:+1:1] 
2018-02-17 12:56:28	Jesse	I'm gonna be working on this project starting now. I'll try to document my work here. I'm willing to meet up at Hunt if you guys are interested, but it's not necessary. 
2018-02-17 13:04:31	ajshryoc	Sweet. I may work on this depending on how quickly I can do my networks homework today.  
2018-02-17 13:07:13	Jesse	Ok. I'm gonna be looking more into higher level design aspects rather than implementation. I'll let you know what I find. [:+1:1] 
2018-02-17 14:19:00	Jesse	I think I've worked out most of the ambiguous stuff. i can try to upload my notes but it is quite illegible, so ill have to meet with you guys some time to explain.
2018-02-17 14:19:00		Once I work out the rest of the thinking stuff, Ill try to lay out what needs to be done in the form of  a informal UML diagram. From there, I'm going to give out some tasks as far as implementation of this UML. 
2018-02-17 14:19:00		this is my goal for today.

2018-02-17 17:47:09	Jesse	Hey guys, I pushed my UML diagram. Tomorrow I'll handle some of the basic classes like hand, pile, deck and whatever. I also assigned myself to the UI task. 
2018-02-17 17:47:30	ajshryoc	Hey @jwstanl3, which one of the two games would you like to work on? 
2018-02-17 20:14:45	jwstanl3	I'll look into Solitaire. Sorry for taking so long to reply.

2018-02-19 10:14:55	Jesse	I dont think I updated you guys on what I did in that commit. I implemented the basic structure and started on the solitaire UI. I left the rulebook and other game specific things unimplemented. I would also like to expand the basic structures functionality to things like flipping over a card or moving sets of cards from one pile to another pile. 
2018-02-19 17:12:34	ajshryoc	Yeah, added functionality like that would be great. I'm not sure how difficult it would be, but it would be cool if the Pile class was iterable so that you could use it in a for loop. If it too complicated to add that don't worry about it

2018-02-19 21:24:57	Jesse	I added functionality for piles giving one card or giving a set of cards. [:+1:1]

2018-02-19 21:56:00	Jesse	the UI for solitaire is starting to look good. 
2018-02-19 21:56:28	ajshryoc	Yeah, nice! 
2018-02-19 22:03:59	Jesse	I'm not gonna lie, the base code is a lil messy, so if theres any general features that you think needs to be in there just let me know and I can implement it. 
2018-02-19 22:04:46	Jesse	as for the UI, I'm making it so you guys just pass in a set of piles. and the index in the set of piles will determine which pile is positioned where. 
2018-02-19 22:05:46	Jesse	I also hardcoded the height of the board since we know that there will be no higher stack of cards than 13 (which is Ace-King) in solitaire 
2018-02-19 22:07:38	ajshryoc	That would be pretty sweet if we just have to pass in the piles. I think it looks pretty good. We can worry about code cleanup later too. 
2018-02-19 22:09:08	ajshryoc	I was able to get crazy eights working with just 1 player playing cards on the pile, so it looks like we're in a pretty good spot for this project 
2018-02-19 22:09:23	Jesse	dang really? thats pretty awesome 
2018-02-19 22:10:43	ajshryoc	It'll be a cool project once it's all working. The way we have it setup (with your cards.py objects) made it pretty straightforward to program 
2018-02-19 22:10:45	Jesse	can you tell me what the board would look like for crazy eight? is it just a pile for taking cards and a pile for laying cards? also displaying the hand to the player? 
2018-02-19 22:13:53	ajshryoc	@ajshryoc uploaded a file: https://plm18.slack.com/files/U8M1VEVT3/F9ATPNWBS/crazyeights.jpg (crazyeights.JPG) and commented: Here's what I've been using as a sort of debug UI.  So, there's the pile for taking cards, pile for playing cards, and the player's hand. I'm unsure how to handle the computer players since the number of card they hold is definitely relevant to the player. 
2018-02-19 22:14:54	ajshryoc	I think just listing the AI players and showing how many face down cards are in their hands on different lines would be good enough 
2018-02-19 22:16:20	ajshryoc	As a side note, I defined a Move as a Crazy Eights specific object (although it might be worth pulling out) that is defined by a Card, a "to" Pile, and a "from" Pile. It has a method called "make" that will remove the Card from "from" Pile and add it to "to" Pile. This kinda thing might be useful for solitaire too  (edited)
2018-02-19 22:17:59	Jesse	oh. I made a similar function in my Pile class (giveOneCard) 
2018-02-19 22:19:01	ajshryoc	No problem, that totally works. I'll adjust what I've got to match your code once I pull it in 
2018-02-19 22:19:20	Jesse	Would you guys be willing to meet up tomorrow so that we can clean up our code? / continue developing? 
2018-02-19 22:19:32	Jesse	I'm good all day except class time 
2018-02-19 22:20:10	ajshryoc	I'm good from around 1:30 to class time

2018-02-20 07:46:29	jwstanl3	Would you guys be able to meet after class? I have a class from 1:30-2:45 and then I tutor from 3-4 
2018-02-20 10:30:28	Jesse	Yeah. Would you be able to meet after class andrew? I don't think we need a lot of time. My plan was just to use an hour or two to clean up some of the code in the generic game structure/UI's and implement any functionality you guys think would be good for both games. 
2018-02-20 10:32:21	Jesse	If not, I could meet with andrew an hour before class and then after class with Joseph for an hour. 
2018-02-20 11:36:11	ajshryoc	I could meet briefly right after class

2018-02-20 12:00:47	jwstanl3	I have the solitaire game pretty much working completely, but I changed some things in the cards and SolitaireUI files, so I'll wait until we meet to commit anything

2018-02-20 13:05:32	Jesse	thats awesome!! but arent the red cards supposed to go on black cards and vice versa? 
2018-02-20 13:05:45	Jesse	its okay if we want to change it for the sake of project scope 
2018-02-20 13:05:53	Jesse	to be red on red 
2018-02-20 13:08:42	jwstanl3	The rules from Bicycle didn't have any restrictions on color. It just had to be consecutive. But, yea, normally you would alternate colors, and it would be pretty easy to switch the program to follow that. 
2018-02-20 13:09:15	jwstanl3	The game's really easy at the moment, so adding something like that would help it be more challenging.

2018-02-21 20:28:57	jwstanl3	I pushed some fixes to my solitaire code. Cards have to alternate in color now in the stacks. There were a few other bugs I fixed. I still haven't added a win state, or a loss state really, but it should be able to detect a win or loss, if the loss state doesn't have any moves left. I haven't been able to beat the game since adding the alternating colors, so I'm not sure if this is true or not.

2018-02-22 22:08:38	ajshryoc	Added what I have for crazy eights. I think the only major feature missing is the suit change when playing an 8. I also intend to clean up the code and little bit to get rid of redundancy.  (edited)
2018-02-22 22:12:02	Jesse	great!! I'll probably take a look some time this weekend

2018-02-24 12:28:32	Jesse	Do you guys understand python decorators? I haven't been able to reproduce a function that demonstrates the difference with/without the decorator. 
2018-02-25 20:28:31	ajshryoc	Sorry, intended to respond, then totally forgot about this. My understanding of python decorators is it's just another form of syntax for calling functions; however, it sort of ties two functions together and modifies the function being decorated. Here's an article I found that gives a good explanation on the subject: http://python-3-patterns-idioms-test.readthedocs.io/en/latest/PythonDecorators.html

2018-02-25 22:39:22	ajshryoc	Just pushed the finished version of Crazy Eights. It's kinda a mess, so I'll probably do some refactoring of it at some point. I also modified cards.py to print out the unicode symbol corresponding to the card's suit. I was curious about how to do it and it turned out to be really easy, so I added it. I think it makes it much easier to see the cards 
2018-02-25 22:41:04	Jesse	oh nice!!! let me know if theres anything youd like me to change.  
2018-02-26 13:50:38	Jesse	I played both crazy eights and solitaire and I haven't noticed any bugs. winning looks good as well. 
2018-02-26 13:52:31	Jesse	we may be able to polish a few things up but honestly, it doesn't matter too much because we'll be taking parts of our code out and re implementing stuff for the second submission. I think what we have is gold. If there's anything you guys want me to change, just let me know. 
2018-02-26 17:12:29	ajshryoc	Glad you liked it! I think they both play pretty well 
2018-03-12 13:07:36	Jesse	Hey guys, we need to figure out what we need to submit and submit it before class tomorrow. 
2018-03-12 13:11:03	Jesse	Do you guys have the transcript of the 2 games? if not I can make them. 
2018-03-12 13:12:50	ajshryoc	I don't have a transcript. You should be able to use the tee command to output to a file and stdout 
2018-03-12 13:13:04	Jesse	I was just gonna use script 
2018-03-12 13:13:18	Jesse	it automatically outputs the log to a file 
2018-03-12 13:13:31	ajshryoc	Yeah, whatever works 
2018-03-12 13:13:53	Jesse	alright.

2018-03-12 14:41:24	Jesse	Alright, the transcripts are made. Can someone else do the work of submitting and making a cheap readme with some basic information like linking to the transcript file and how to run each of the games?

2018-03-16 10:06:54	Jesse	I'm gonna take a look now about what we can do to our project for submission 3. 
2018-03-16 10:13:12	Jesse	Nobody but me used cardsTest.py right? would you guys mind if I deleted that file? 
2018-03-16 10:17:46	Jesse	We may want to ask the professor about this... I worry our games are too different. 
2018-03-17 00:11:58	ajshryoc	You can delete cardsTest.py if no one is using it. I would probably make a new directory in the git repo called 'project3' or something so that we have a record of both of our submissions. As for the issues with the games, if you want to ask him, go ahead. I think we could make it work but I'm sure he could provide some insight. <--- Sorry typed this up about 14 hours ago and never hit send 
2018-03-19 14:19:24	Jesse	We got a 90% it seems on what we submitted for the project. He said he liked our nouns/verbs but was disappointed that we didn't make an FSM. He also linked "Derive Interfaces from Constraints of Data" as if its some reading on moodle or github. 
2018-03-19 14:19:57	Jesse	... I checked both, and I'm not sure what he's talking about 
2018-03-19 14:36:38	ajshryoc	I'm also unsure what he meant by that. Our design did get a shoutout in #proj2_mar1 though so that's pretty cool 
2018-03-19 14:38:04	Jesse	i didn't see that. that is pretty cool 
2018-03-19 14:38:44	ajshryoc	Also, just realized the section the he references is also in that Google doc with the feedback 
2018-03-19 15:03:59	jwstanl3	Even after looking at that section, I'm still not sure what he wants us to get from that. The lines he references are where the suits are printed in Crazy Eights to allow the user to select which suit to change to. I don't get how that could be changed. 
2018-03-19 16:30:23	ajshryoc	It could definitely be made better. I think the whole system, crazy eights especially, could benefit from state machines. I intended to cleanup some of that code, but I decided to just wait until this upcoming submission. I'll take a better look at the comments later 
2018-03-19 17:59:01	Jesse	I'm not sure I know how the system could be improved with FSMs. But if you know what you'd like to change, I could definitely help out with that. The issue I see with FSMs is that only crazy eights would use it... and it would just be wasted code for solitaire. 
2018-03-19 19:10:58	ajshryoc	I'm sure he'll provide more context tomorrow. I'll review their comments too and we can go from there 
2018-03-20 10:11:37	Jesse	Hey guys, I was checking out a few other peoples code, and i found one where they built the FSM setup stuff, and didn't call it anywhere in their code xD. I wonder if the graders caught it.

2018-01-23 17:45:08	Jesse	Hello 
2018-01-27 17:50:56	Jesse	we should probably figure out what 2 card games we are going to choose. 
2018-01-27 17:52:53	Jesse	so one has to be some variant of a game which I forgot the name to.. and the other could be anything that involves the standard 52 deck of cards. 
2018-01-27 17:58:05	Jesse	I'm thinking solitaire or some variant of it would be pretty easy to program. 
2018-01-27 18:00:03	Jesse	it wouldnt be as easy as something like blackjack or go fish but those ones are already taken. 
2018-01-27 20:53:36	ajshryoc	I'm cool with solitaire. The game you forgot the name to is Bartok. A Bartok variant I would suggest we annotate would be Crazy Eights. 
2018-01-27 20:54:10	Jesse	im not familiar with either of the two games 
2018-01-27 20:54:36	ajshryoc	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crazy_Eights
2018-01-27 20:54:36		Wikipedia: Crazy Eights
2018-01-27 20:54:36		Crazy Eights is a shedding-type card game for two to seven players. The object of the game is to be the first to get rid of all the player's cards to a discard pile. The game is considered a pre-extension of Switch and Mau Mau.
2018-01-27 20:54:36		A standard 52-card deck is used when there are five or fewer players. When there are more than five players, two decks are shuffled together and all 104 cards are used. 
2018-01-27 20:54:59	ajshryoc	Not familiar with solitaire? Or Bartok? 
2018-01-27 22:25:26	Jesse	bartok and crazy eight. 
2018-01-28 20:18:47	ajshryoc	Bartok is just the game where you have a hand and have to play cards that match a card with the same suit/rank until you run out of cards. Crazy Eights is just that with a couple of other additions, if I remember 
2018-01-28 20:33:54	Jesse	gotcha. well it may make it difficult if we choose a game vastly different from that, so idk if solitaire is a good idea... but I'm sure we could do it if we cant find a better game. 
2018-01-28 20:54:33	ajshryoc	I mean, technically our language should be able to create any kind of game so having two very different games to base it off of might actually be beneficial, although a little more work for the annotation. 
2018-01-28 20:55:28	Jesse	should we call dibs on solitaire then in the proj1 channel? 
2018-01-28 20:57:45	ajshryoc	I'm cool with that 
2018-01-28 21:11:35	ajshryoc	Do we have to claim both games? Or just the non-Bartok clone one? 
2018-01-28 21:12:15	Jesse	i guess juat the non-bartok 
2018-01-28 21:12:27	Jesse	just* 
2018-01-29 17:21:22	Jesse	When can you guys meet up to work on the card game annotations? 
2018-01-29 17:22:08	Jesse	I'm free up until 4:30 on thursday. 
2018-01-29 17:22:23	Jesse	or any time on friday

2018-01-29 17:33:21	Jesse	sounds good to me.

2018-01-29 17:50:03	Jesse	id be willing to meet up on friday. what about you andrew? 
2018-01-29 17:53:51	ajshryoc	I've got senior design 10:40-12:30 on friday and I typically work afterwards. I could meet before class if that is an option for you guys? Another suggestion would be after class Thursday 
2018-01-29 17:54:37	jwstanl3	I can meet after class Thursday 
2018-01-29 17:54:48	Jesse	Yeah I can do that 
2018-01-29 17:55:25	ajshryoc	Alright, cool 
2018-02-01 20:59:14	Jesse	hey guys, I put in a little bit at the end of the card game annotations. please check if theres anything you'd like to add or modify. 
2018-02-01 21:35:25	ajshryoc	That part looks good and I think was a smart addition 
2018-02-01 21:35:41	Jesse	thank you 
2018-02-01 21:37:41	ajshryoc	I will probably go back to this throughout the weekend if I think of more similarities/differences to add. Overall though, I think it looks good. I probably won't be able to put in a good chunk of time on this assignment until Monday, but I don't think it'll take that long to write out what we already have. 
2018-02-01 21:38:41	Jesse	when you mean write out, do you mean hand-written? 
2018-02-01 21:39:15	ajshryoc	Sorry, I mean like write out in a sentence rather than just a list 
2018-02-01 21:40:00	Jesse	Ahh.. I'm not too sure its important to have it in sentence form, but if you think that would be better, go for it xD 
2018-02-01 21:40:48	Jesse	i can of course help too.. just want to be sure thats something you think is important 
2018-02-01 21:42:56	ajshryoc	I suppose he doesn't really say what format it should be in and only says "list what is similar, what is different", so I'm not entirely sure what he's looking for. I think as long as it's clear we can have it in list form, maybe just with an intro paragraph for each section. 
2018-02-01 21:45:00	Jesse	I don't think he knows what he is looking for lol. And I'm not too sure what I would put in an intro paragraph. 
2018-02-01 23:04:13	ajshryoc	Yeah, good point. We can see how it is and how much time we want to put in next week. 
2018-02-05 21:28:33	ajshryoc	I'm working on the annotations a litte. Just trying to add some more words to the game descriptions. Let me know what you guys think and feel free to add anything 
2018-02-06 19:31:23	ajshryoc	I made a couple small additions to the annotation. Mainly just for formatting/flow. Let me know what you guys think and add whatever else you think we need. If you guys think it's good, I can submit the doc 
2018-02-06 20:39:28	Jesse	ill take a look now. sorry i was distracted 
2018-02-06 20:44:36	Jesse	well dang. thats a lot more of an improvement than i was expecting. Nice work Andrew  
2018-02-06 20:45:22	jwstanl3	Everything looks good 
2018-02-06 20:47:21	Jesse	yeah I agree. 
2018-02-06 20:48:54	Jesse	would you like me to submit? 
2018-02-06 20:49:09	ajshryoc	Thanks, just took what we had before and made it flow a little better  
2018-02-06 20:49:18	ajshryoc	Yeah, go ahead and submit if you want 
2018-02-06 20:50:39	Jesse	done

2018-02-11 11:38:18	ajshryoc	I have not taken a look at it so far. I just saw that Alex Phelps posted some tips in #homework that seemed helpful. Will probably get to the homework later today or tomorrow 
2018-02-11 11:49:28	Jesse	yeah. i gotcha 
2018-02-12 21:17:50	ajshryoc	Have you guys finished the homework? I think I've got it---it looks like it's behaving correctly, but I'm not sure what he wants exactly 
2018-02-13 10:43:30	Jesse	I submitted something but I don't think it's right at all. I just made the program look like it was doing something right and submittted it. 
2018-02-13 14:46:06	Jesse	I just pushed  a starter to our cardgame project in our github repo. check it out when ya get the chance. i was just sketching some things up so feel free to modify whatever. 
2018-02-13 15:46:25	ajshryoc	Okay, I'll check it out 
2018-02-14 21:35:45	ajshryoc	@ajshryoc shared a file: https://plm18.slack.com/files/U8M1VEVT3/F98NZUTNC/CSC495_Project_Todo_List (CSC495 Project Todo List) 
2018-02-14 21:35:45		@ajshryoc commented on @ajshryoc?s file https://plm18.slack.com/files/U8M1VEVT3/F98NZUTNC/CSC495_Project_Todo_List (CSC495 Project Todo List): Hey guys, I did a little design work on an approach I've thought of for implementing the two games based on some stuff we've talked about in class. I mainly just tried to break down the game object that were suggested we use in class in the context of a finite state machine. Let me know what you think and if you have suggestions/feedback. We could then write this up as GitHub issues. That way, we can assign things as tasks. 
2018-02-14 21:42:45	Jesse	thats a pretty solid writeup. I'll spend some more time looking over it later.  I think the most complex thing is going to be implementing rules and goals since they can vary  a lot from game to game. 
2018-02-14 21:44:58	ajshryoc	I agree. That along with what constitutes a valid move---especially with solitaire. 
2018-02-15 14:40:27	Jesse	hey guys, i'm gonna be late to class today. I've got a video call with the people i'll be interning with from 3:30 to 4:30. 
2018-02-16 00:07:50	ajshryoc	added an integration to this channel: https://plm18.slack.com/services/B9A0YJ9V1 (github) 
2018-02-16 00:12:00	ajshryoc	I've converted the list I wrote up yesterday into a few GitHub issues. Please feel free to take a look and modify if you see fit. With these we can more easily divide up tasks (or subtasks) and tag commits/branches with them. I also added the GitHub app to this channel, which will post when events happen on the repo. If it starts to get annoying, I can reduce the notifications or turn it off. Figured I'd give it a shot and see if it's useful for keeping everyone up to date on code changes 
2018-02-16 10:06:31	Jesse	I'll start working on this tomorrow. I'm dedicating today to English 331 and research. thanks for this Andrew. [:+1:1] 
2018-02-17 12:56:28	Jesse	I'm gonna be working on this project starting now. I'll try to document my work here. I'm willing to meet up at Hunt if you guys are interested, but it's not necessary. 
2018-02-17 13:04:31	ajshryoc	Sweet. I may work on this depending on how quickly I can do my networks homework today.  
2018-02-17 13:07:13	Jesse	Ok. I'm gonna be looking more into higher level design aspects rather than implementation. I'll let you know what I find. [:+1:1] 
2018-02-17 14:19:00	Jesse	I think I've worked out most of the ambiguous stuff. i can try to upload my notes but it is quite illegible, so ill have to meet with you guys some time to explain.
2018-02-17 14:19:00		Once I work out the rest of the thinking stuff, Ill try to lay out what needs to be done in the form of  a informal UML diagram. From there, I'm going to give out some tasks as far as implementation of this UML. 
2018-02-17 14:19:00		this is my goal for today.

2018-02-17 17:47:09	Jesse	Hey guys, I pushed my UML diagram. Tomorrow I'll handle some of the basic classes like hand, pile, deck and whatever. I also assigned myself to the UI task. 
2018-02-17 17:47:30	ajshryoc	Hey @jwstanl3, which one of the two games would you like to work on? 
2018-02-17 20:14:45	jwstanl3	I'll look into Solitaire. Sorry for taking so long to reply.

2018-02-19 10:14:55	Jesse	I dont think I updated you guys on what I did in that commit. I implemented the basic structure and started on the solitaire UI. I left the rulebook and other game specific things unimplemented. I would also like to expand the basic structures functionality to things like flipping over a card or moving sets of cards from one pile to another pile. 
2018-02-19 17:12:34	ajshryoc	Yeah, added functionality like that would be great. I'm not sure how difficult it would be, but it would be cool if the Pile class was iterable so that you could use it in a for loop. If it too complicated to add that don't worry about it

2018-02-19 21:24:57	Jesse	I added functionality for piles giving one card or giving a set of cards. [:+1:1]

2018-02-19 21:56:00	Jesse	the UI for solitaire is starting to look good. 
2018-02-19 21:56:28	ajshryoc	Yeah, nice! 
2018-02-19 22:03:59	Jesse	I'm not gonna lie, the base code is a lil messy, so if theres any general features that you think needs to be in there just let me know and I can implement it. 
2018-02-19 22:04:46	Jesse	as for the UI, I'm making it so you guys just pass in a set of piles. and the index in the set of piles will determine which pile is positioned where. 
2018-02-19 22:05:46	Jesse	I also hardcoded the height of the board since we know that there will be no higher stack of cards than 13 (which is Ace-King) in solitaire 
2018-02-19 22:07:38	ajshryoc	That would be pretty sweet if we just have to pass in the piles. I think it looks pretty good. We can worry about code cleanup later too. 
2018-02-19 22:09:08	ajshryoc	I was able to get crazy eights working with just 1 player playing cards on the pile, so it looks like we're in a pretty good spot for this project 
2018-02-19 22:09:23	Jesse	dang really? thats pretty awesome 
2018-02-19 22:10:43	ajshryoc	It'll be a cool project once it's all working. The way we have it setup (with your cards.py objects) made it pretty straightforward to program 
2018-02-19 22:10:45	Jesse	can you tell me what the board would look like for crazy eight? is it just a pile for taking cards and a pile for laying cards? also displaying the hand to the player? 
2018-02-19 22:13:53	ajshryoc	@ajshryoc uploaded a file: https://plm18.slack.com/files/U8M1VEVT3/F9ATPNWBS/crazyeights.jpg (crazyeights.JPG) and commented: Here's what I've been using as a sort of debug UI.  So, there's the pile for taking cards, pile for playing cards, and the player's hand. I'm unsure how to handle the computer players since the number of card they hold is definitely relevant to the player. 
2018-02-19 22:14:54	ajshryoc	I think just listing the AI players and showing how many face down cards are in their hands on different lines would be good enough 
2018-02-19 22:16:20	ajshryoc	As a side note, I defined a Move as a Crazy Eights specific object (although it might be worth pulling out) that is defined by a Card, a "to" Pile, and a "from" Pile. It has a method called "make" that will remove the Card from "from" Pile and add it to "to" Pile. This kinda thing might be useful for solitaire too  (edited)
2018-02-19 22:17:59	Jesse	oh. I made a similar function in my Pile class (giveOneCard) 
2018-02-19 22:19:01	ajshryoc	No problem, that totally works. I'll adjust what I've got to match your code once I pull it in 
2018-02-19 22:19:20	Jesse	Would you guys be willing to meet up tomorrow so that we can clean up our code? / continue developing? 
2018-02-19 22:19:32	Jesse	I'm good all day except class time 
2018-02-19 22:20:10	ajshryoc	I'm good from around 1:30 to class time

2018-02-20 10:30:28	Jesse	Yeah. Would you be able to meet after class andrew? I don't think we need a lot of time. My plan was just to use an hour or two to clean up some of the code in the generic game structure/UI's and implement any functionality you guys think would be good for both games. 
2018-02-20 10:32:21	Jesse	If not, I could meet with andrew an hour before class and then after class with Joseph for an hour.

2018-02-20 13:05:32	Jesse	thats awesome!! but arent the red cards supposed to go on black cards and vice versa? 
2018-02-20 13:05:45	Jesse	its okay if we want to change it for the sake of project scope 
2018-02-20 13:05:53	Jesse	to be red on red 
2018-02-20 13:08:42	jwstanl3	The rules from Bicycle didn't have any restrictions on color. It just had to be consecutive. But, yea, normally you would alternate colors, and it would be pretty easy to switch the program to follow that. 
2018-02-20 13:09:15	jwstanl3	The game's really easy at the moment, so adding something like that would help it be more challenging.

2018-02-21 20:28:57	jwstanl3	I pushed some fixes to my solitaire code. Cards have to alternate in color now in the stacks. There were a few other bugs I fixed. I still haven't added a win state, or a loss state really, but it should be able to detect a win or loss, if the loss state doesn't have any moves left. I haven't been able to beat the game since adding the alternating colors, so I'm not sure if this is true or not.

2018-02-24 12:28:32	Jesse	Do you guys understand python decorators? I haven't been able to reproduce a function that demonstrates the difference with/without the decorator. 
2018-02-25 20:28:31	ajshryoc	Sorry, intended to respond, then totally forgot about this. My understanding of python decorators is it's just another form of syntax for calling functions; however, it sort of ties two functions together and modifies the function being decorated. Here's an article I found that gives a good explanation on the subject: http://python-3-patterns-idioms-test.readthedocs.io/en/latest/PythonDecorators.html

2018-02-25 22:39:22	ajshryoc	Just pushed the finished version of Crazy Eights. It's kinda a mess, so I'll probably do some refactoring of it at some point. I also modified cards.py to print out the unicode symbol corresponding to the card's suit. I was curious about how to do it and it turned out to be really easy, so I added it. I think it makes it much easier to see the cards 
2018-02-25 22:41:04	Jesse	oh nice!!! let me know if theres anything youd like me to change.  
2018-02-26 13:50:38	Jesse	I played both crazy eights and solitaire and I haven't noticed any bugs. winning looks good as well. 
2018-02-26 13:52:31	Jesse	we may be able to polish a few things up but honestly, it doesn't matter too much because we'll be taking parts of our code out and re implementing stuff for the second submission. I think what we have is gold. If there's anything you guys want me to change, just let me know.

2018-03-12 19:16:24	ajshryoc	Submitted the project. On moodle, I just turned in the README.md file we have top level in the repository. I think that should be enough

2018-03-16 10:06:54	Jesse	I'm gonna take a look now about what we can do to our project for submission 3. 
2018-03-16 10:13:12	Jesse	Nobody but me used cardsTest.py right? would you guys mind if I deleted that file? 
2018-03-16 10:17:46	Jesse	We may want to ask the professor about this... I worry our games are too different. 
2018-03-17 00:11:58	ajshryoc	You can delete cardsTest.py if no one is using it. I would probably make a new directory in the git repo called 'project3' or something so that we have a record of both of our submissions. As for the issues with the games, if you want to ask him, go ahead. I think we could make it work but I'm sure he could provide some insight. <--- Sorry typed this up about 14 hours ago and never hit send 
2018-03-19 14:19:24	Jesse	We got a 90% it seems on what we submitted for the project. He said he liked our nouns/verbs but was disappointed that we didn't make an FSM. He also linked "Derive Interfaces from Constraints of Data" as if its some reading on moodle or github. 
2018-03-19 14:19:57	Jesse	... I checked both, and I'm not sure what he's talking about 
2018-03-19 14:36:38	ajshryoc	I'm also unsure what he meant by that. Our design did get a shoutout in #proj2_mar1 though so that's pretty cool 
2018-03-19 14:38:04	Jesse	i didn't see that. that is pretty cool 
2018-03-19 14:38:44	ajshryoc	Also, just realized the section the he references is also in that Google doc with the feedback 
2018-03-19 15:03:59	jwstanl3	Even after looking at that section, I'm still not sure what he wants us to get from that. The lines he references are where the suits are printed in Crazy Eights to allow the user to select which suit to change to. I don't get how that could be changed. 
2018-03-19 16:30:23	ajshryoc	It could definitely be made better. I think the whole system, crazy eights especially, could benefit from state machines. I intended to cleanup some of that code, but I decided to just wait until this upcoming submission. I'll take a better look at the comments later 
2018-03-19 17:59:01	Jesse	I'm not sure I know how the system could be improved with FSMs. But if you know what you'd like to change, I could definitely help out with that. The issue I see with FSMs is that only crazy eights would use it... and it would just be wasted code for solitaire. 
2018-03-19 19:10:58	ajshryoc	I'm sure he'll provide more context tomorrow. I'll review their comments too and we can go from there 
2018-03-20 10:11:37	Jesse	Hey guys, I was checking out a few other peoples code, and i found one where they built the FSM setup stuff, and didn't call it anywhere in their code xD. I wonder if the graders caught it.

2018-03-21 12:56:29	Jesse	I figured it out.

2018-01-23 17:45:08	Jesse	Hello 
2018-01-27 17:50:56	Jesse	we should probably figure out what 2 card games we are going to choose. 
2018-01-27 17:52:53	Jesse	so one has to be some variant of a game which I forgot the name to.. and the other could be anything that involves the standard 52 deck of cards. 
2018-01-27 17:58:05	Jesse	I'm thinking solitaire or some variant of it would be pretty easy to program. 
2018-01-27 18:00:03	Jesse	it wouldnt be as easy as something like blackjack or go fish but those ones are already taken. 
2018-01-27 20:53:36	ajshryoc	I'm cool with solitaire. The game you forgot the name to is Bartok. A Bartok variant I would suggest we annotate would be Crazy Eights. 
2018-01-27 20:54:10	Jesse	im not familiar with either of the two games 
2018-01-27 20:54:36	ajshryoc	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crazy_Eights
2018-01-27 20:54:36		Wikipedia: Crazy Eights
2018-01-27 20:54:36		Crazy Eights is a shedding-type card game for two to seven players. The object of the game is to be the first to get rid of all the player's cards to a discard pile. The game is considered a pre-extension of Switch and Mau Mau.
2018-01-27 20:54:36		A standard 52-card deck is used when there are five or fewer players. When there are more than five players, two decks are shuffled together and all 104 cards are used. 
2018-01-27 20:54:59	ajshryoc	Not familiar with solitaire? Or Bartok? 
2018-01-27 22:25:26	Jesse	bartok and crazy eight. 
2018-01-28 20:18:47	ajshryoc	Bartok is just the game where you have a hand and have to play cards that match a card with the same suit/rank until you run out of cards. Crazy Eights is just that with a couple of other additions, if I remember 
2018-01-28 20:33:54	Jesse	gotcha. well it may make it difficult if we choose a game vastly different from that, so idk if solitaire is a good idea... but I'm sure we could do it if we cant find a better game. 
2018-01-28 20:54:33	ajshryoc	I mean, technically our language should be able to create any kind of game so having two very different games to base it off of might actually be beneficial, although a little more work for the annotation. 
2018-01-28 20:55:28	Jesse	should we call dibs on solitaire then in the proj1 channel? 
2018-01-28 20:57:45	ajshryoc	I'm cool with that 
2018-01-28 21:11:35	ajshryoc	Do we have to claim both games? Or just the non-Bartok clone one? 
2018-01-28 21:12:15	Jesse	i guess juat the non-bartok 
2018-01-28 21:12:27	Jesse	just* 
2018-01-29 17:21:22	Jesse	When can you guys meet up to work on the card game annotations? 
2018-01-29 17:22:08	Jesse	I'm free up until 4:30 on thursday. 
2018-01-29 17:22:23	Jesse	or any time on friday 
2018-01-29 17:30:09	ajshryoc	Between 2 and 4:30 on Thursday works for me 
2018-01-29 17:33:21	Jesse	sounds good to me. 
2018-01-29 17:49:17	jwstanl3	I'm busy 2-6pm pretty much everyday except for Friday 
2018-01-29 17:50:03	Jesse	id be willing to meet up on friday. what about you andrew? 
2018-01-29 17:53:51	ajshryoc	I've got senior design 10:40-12:30 on friday and I typically work afterwards. I could meet before class if that is an option for you guys? Another suggestion would be after class Thursday 
2018-01-29 17:54:37	jwstanl3	I can meet after class Thursday 
2018-01-29 17:54:48	Jesse	Yeah I can do that 
2018-01-29 17:55:25	ajshryoc	Alright, cool 
2018-02-01 20:59:14	Jesse	hey guys, I put in a little bit at the end of the card game annotations. please check if theres anything you'd like to add or modify. 
2018-02-01 21:35:25	ajshryoc	That part looks good and I think was a smart addition 
2018-02-01 21:35:41	Jesse	thank you 
2018-02-01 21:37:41	ajshryoc	I will probably go back to this throughout the weekend if I think of more similarities/differences to add. Overall though, I think it looks good. I probably won't be able to put in a good chunk of time on this assignment until Monday, but I don't think it'll take that long to write out what we already have. 
2018-02-01 21:38:41	Jesse	when you mean write out, do you mean hand-written? 
2018-02-01 21:39:15	ajshryoc	Sorry, I mean like write out in a sentence rather than just a list 
2018-02-01 21:40:00	Jesse	Ahh.. I'm not too sure its important to have it in sentence form, but if you think that would be better, go for it xD 
2018-02-01 21:40:48	Jesse	i can of course help too.. just want to be sure thats something you think is important 
2018-02-01 21:42:56	ajshryoc	I suppose he doesn't really say what format it should be in and only says "list what is similar, what is different", so I'm not entirely sure what he's looking for. I think as long as it's clear we can have it in list form, maybe just with an intro paragraph for each section. 
2018-02-01 21:45:00	Jesse	I don't think he knows what he is looking for lol. And I'm not too sure what I would put in an intro paragraph. 
2018-02-01 23:04:13	ajshryoc	Yeah, good point. We can see how it is and how much time we want to put in next week. 
2018-02-05 21:28:33	ajshryoc	I'm working on the annotations a litte. Just trying to add some more words to the game descriptions. Let me know what you guys think and feel free to add anything 
2018-02-06 19:31:23	ajshryoc	I made a couple small additions to the annotation. Mainly just for formatting/flow. Let me know what you guys think and add whatever else you think we need. If you guys think it's good, I can submit the doc 
2018-02-06 20:39:28	Jesse	ill take a look now. sorry i was distracted 
2018-02-06 20:44:36	Jesse	well dang. thats a lot more of an improvement than i was expecting. Nice work Andrew  
2018-02-06 20:45:22	jwstanl3	Everything looks good 
2018-02-06 20:47:21	Jesse	yeah I agree. 
2018-02-06 20:48:54	Jesse	would you like me to submit? 
2018-02-06 20:49:09	ajshryoc	Thanks, just took what we had before and made it flow a little better  
2018-02-06 20:49:18	ajshryoc	Yeah, go ahead and submit if you want 
2018-02-06 20:50:39	Jesse	done 
2018-02-06 20:50:49	ajshryoc	Sweet 
2018-02-11 09:22:16	Jesse	Hey guys do either of you understand the homework? 
2018-02-11 11:38:18	ajshryoc	I have not taken a look at it so far. I just saw that Alex Phelps posted some tips in #homework that seemed helpful. Will probably get to the homework later today or tomorrow 
2018-02-11 11:49:28	Jesse	yeah. i gotcha 
2018-02-12 21:17:50	ajshryoc	Have you guys finished the homework? I think I've got it---it looks like it's behaving correctly, but I'm not sure what he wants exactly 
2018-02-13 10:43:30	Jesse	I submitted something but I don't think it's right at all. I just made the program look like it was doing something right and submittted it. 
2018-02-13 14:46:06	Jesse	I just pushed  a starter to our cardgame project in our github repo. check it out when ya get the chance. i was just sketching some things up so feel free to modify whatever. 
2018-02-13 15:46:25	ajshryoc	Okay, I'll check it out 
2018-02-14 21:35:45	ajshryoc	@ajshryoc shared a file: https://plm18.slack.com/files/U8M1VEVT3/F98NZUTNC/CSC495_Project_Todo_List (CSC495 Project Todo List) 
2018-02-14 21:35:45		@ajshryoc commented on @ajshryoc?s file https://plm18.slack.com/files/U8M1VEVT3/F98NZUTNC/CSC495_Project_Todo_List (CSC495 Project Todo List): Hey guys, I did a little design work on an approach I've thought of for implementing the two games based on some stuff we've talked about in class. I mainly just tried to break down the game object that were suggested we use in class in the context of a finite state machine. Let me know what you think and if you have suggestions/feedback. We could then write this up as GitHub issues. That way, we can assign things as tasks. 
2018-02-14 21:42:45	Jesse	thats a pretty solid writeup. I'll spend some more time looking over it later.  I think the most complex thing is going to be implementing rules and goals since they can vary  a lot from game to game. 
2018-02-14 21:44:58	ajshryoc	I agree. That along with what constitutes a valid move---especially with solitaire. 
2018-02-15 14:40:27	Jesse	hey guys, i'm gonna be late to class today. I've got a video call with the people i'll be interning with from 3:30 to 4:30. 
2018-02-16 00:07:50	ajshryoc	added an integration to this channel: https://plm18.slack.com/services/B9A0YJ9V1 (github) 
2018-02-16 00:12:00	ajshryoc	I've converted the list I wrote up yesterday into a few GitHub issues. Please feel free to take a look and modify if you see fit. With these we can more easily divide up tasks (or subtasks) and tag commits/branches with them. I also added the GitHub app to this channel, which will post when events happen on the repo. If it starts to get annoying, I can reduce the notifications or turn it off. Figured I'd give it a shot and see if it's useful for keeping everyone up to date on code changes 
2018-02-16 10:06:31	Jesse	I'll start working on this tomorrow. I'm dedicating today to English 331 and research. thanks for this Andrew. [:+1:1] 
2018-02-17 12:56:28	Jesse	I'm gonna be working on this project starting now. I'll try to document my work here. I'm willing to meet up at Hunt if you guys are interested, but it's not necessary. 
2018-02-17 13:04:31	ajshryoc	Sweet. I may work on this depending on how quickly I can do my networks homework today.  
2018-02-17 13:07:13	Jesse	Ok. I'm gonna be looking more into higher level design aspects rather than implementation. I'll let you know what I find. [:+1:1] 
2018-02-17 14:19:00	Jesse	I think I've worked out most of the ambiguous stuff. i can try to upload my notes but it is quite illegible, so ill have to meet with you guys some time to explain.
2018-02-17 14:19:00		Once I work out the rest of the thinking stuff, Ill try to lay out what needs to be done in the form of  a informal UML diagram. From there, I'm going to give out some tasks as far as implementation of this UML. 
2018-02-17 14:19:00		this is my goal for today.

2018-02-17 17:47:30	ajshryoc	Hey @jwstanl3, which one of the two games would you like to work on?

2018-02-19 10:14:55	Jesse	I dont think I updated you guys on what I did in that commit. I implemented the basic structure and started on the solitaire UI. I left the rulebook and other game specific things unimplemented. I would also like to expand the basic structures functionality to things like flipping over a card or moving sets of cards from one pile to another pile. 
2018-02-19 17:12:34	ajshryoc	Yeah, added functionality like that would be great. I'm not sure how difficult it would be, but it would be cool if the Pile class was iterable so that you could use it in a for loop. If it too complicated to add that don't worry about it

2018-02-19 21:24:57	Jesse	I added functionality for piles giving one card or giving a set of cards. [:+1:1]

2018-02-19 21:56:00	Jesse	the UI for solitaire is starting to look good. 
2018-02-19 21:56:28	ajshryoc	Yeah, nice! 
2018-02-19 22:03:59	Jesse	I'm not gonna lie, the base code is a lil messy, so if theres any general features that you think needs to be in there just let me know and I can implement it. 
2018-02-19 22:04:46	Jesse	as for the UI, I'm making it so you guys just pass in a set of piles. and the index in the set of piles will determine which pile is positioned where. 
2018-02-19 22:05:46	Jesse	I also hardcoded the height of the board since we know that there will be no higher stack of cards than 13 (which is Ace-King) in solitaire 
2018-02-19 22:07:38	ajshryoc	That would be pretty sweet if we just have to pass in the piles. I think it looks pretty good. We can worry about code cleanup later too. 
2018-02-19 22:09:08	ajshryoc	I was able to get crazy eights working with just 1 player playing cards on the pile, so it looks like we're in a pretty good spot for this project 
2018-02-19 22:09:23	Jesse	dang really? thats pretty awesome 
2018-02-19 22:10:43	ajshryoc	It'll be a cool project once it's all working. The way we have it setup (with your cards.py objects) made it pretty straightforward to program 
2018-02-19 22:10:45	Jesse	can you tell me what the board would look like for crazy eight? is it just a pile for taking cards and a pile for laying cards? also displaying the hand to the player? 
2018-02-19 22:13:53	ajshryoc	@ajshryoc uploaded a file: https://plm18.slack.com/files/U8M1VEVT3/F9ATPNWBS/crazyeights.jpg (crazyeights.JPG) and commented: Here's what I've been using as a sort of debug UI.  So, there's the pile for taking cards, pile for playing cards, and the player's hand. I'm unsure how to handle the computer players since the number of card they hold is definitely relevant to the player. 
2018-02-19 22:14:54	ajshryoc	I think just listing the AI players and showing how many face down cards are in their hands on different lines would be good enough 
2018-02-19 22:16:20	ajshryoc	As a side note, I defined a Move as a Crazy Eights specific object (although it might be worth pulling out) that is defined by a Card, a "to" Pile, and a "from" Pile. It has a method called "make" that will remove the Card from "from" Pile and add it to "to" Pile. This kinda thing might be useful for solitaire too  (edited)
2018-02-19 22:17:59	Jesse	oh. I made a similar function in my Pile class (giveOneCard) 
2018-02-19 22:19:01	ajshryoc	No problem, that totally works. I'll adjust what I've got to match your code once I pull it in 
2018-02-19 22:19:20	Jesse	Would you guys be willing to meet up tomorrow so that we can clean up our code? / continue developing? 
2018-02-19 22:19:32	Jesse	I'm good all day except class time 
2018-02-19 22:20:10	ajshryoc	I'm good from around 1:30 to class time 
2018-02-19 22:24:03	Jesse	okay. I'd be down to meet then.

2018-02-20 07:46:29	jwstanl3	Would you guys be able to meet after class? I have a class from 1:30-2:45 and then I tutor from 3-4 
2018-02-20 10:30:28	Jesse	Yeah. Would you be able to meet after class andrew? I don't think we need a lot of time. My plan was just to use an hour or two to clean up some of the code in the generic game structure/UI's and implement any functionality you guys think would be good for both games. 
2018-02-20 10:32:21	Jesse	If not, I could meet with andrew an hour before class and then after class with Joseph for an hour. 
2018-02-20 11:36:11	ajshryoc	I could meet briefly right after class 
2018-02-20 11:36:34	Jesse	cool! 
2018-02-20 12:00:47	jwstanl3	I have the solitaire game pretty much working completely, but I changed some things in the cards and SolitaireUI files, so I'll wait until we meet to commit anything 
2018-02-20 12:03:24	jwstanl3	@jwstanl3 uploaded a file: https://plm18.slack.com/files/U8N1B358V/F9B8MRFL0/solitaire.gif (Solitaire GIF) and commented: Here's a GIF of the game.  The only thing I haven't implemented is win and loss states. 
2018-02-20 13:05:32	Jesse	thats awesome!! but arent the red cards supposed to go on black cards and vice versa? 
2018-02-20 13:05:45	Jesse	its okay if we want to change it for the sake of project scope 
2018-02-20 13:05:53	Jesse	to be red on red 
2018-02-20 13:08:42	jwstanl3	The rules from Bicycle didn't have any restrictions on color. It just had to be consecutive. But, yea, normally you would alternate colors, and it would be pretty easy to switch the program to follow that. 
2018-02-20 13:09:15	jwstanl3	The game's really easy at the moment, so adding something like that would help it be more challenging.

2018-02-21 20:28:57	jwstanl3	I pushed some fixes to my solitaire code. Cards have to alternate in color now in the stacks. There were a few other bugs I fixed. I still haven't added a win state, or a loss state really, but it should be able to detect a win or loss, if the loss state doesn't have any moves left. I haven't been able to beat the game since adding the alternating colors, so I'm not sure if this is true or not.

2018-02-22 22:08:38	ajshryoc	Added what I have for crazy eights. I think the only major feature missing is the suit change when playing an 8. I also intend to clean up the code and little bit to get rid of redundancy.  (edited)

2018-02-24 12:28:32	Jesse	Do you guys understand python decorators? I haven't been able to reproduce a function that demonstrates the difference with/without the decorator. 
2018-02-25 20:28:31	ajshryoc	Sorry, intended to respond, then totally forgot about this. My understanding of python decorators is it's just another form of syntax for calling functions; however, it sort of ties two functions together and modifies the function being decorated. Here's an article I found that gives a good explanation on the subject: http://python-3-patterns-idioms-test.readthedocs.io/en/latest/PythonDecorators.html

2018-02-25 22:39:22	ajshryoc	Just pushed the finished version of Crazy Eights. It's kinda a mess, so I'll probably do some refactoring of it at some point. I also modified cards.py to print out the unicode symbol corresponding to the card's suit. I was curious about how to do it and it turned out to be really easy, so I added it. I think it makes it much easier to see the cards 
2018-02-25 22:41:04	Jesse	oh nice!!! let me know if theres anything youd like me to change.  
2018-02-26 13:50:38	Jesse	I played both crazy eights and solitaire and I haven't noticed any bugs. winning looks good as well. 
2018-02-26 13:52:31	Jesse	we may be able to polish a few things up but honestly, it doesn't matter too much because we'll be taking parts of our code out and re implementing stuff for the second submission. I think what we have is gold. If there's anything you guys want me to change, just let me know. 
2018-02-26 17:12:29	ajshryoc	Glad you liked it! I think they both play pretty well

2018-03-12 13:12:50	ajshryoc	I don't have a transcript. You should be able to use the tee command to output to a file and stdout 
2018-03-12 13:13:04	Jesse	I was just gonna use script 
2018-03-12 13:13:18	Jesse	it automatically outputs the log to a file

2018-03-16 10:13:12	Jesse	Nobody but me used cardsTest.py right? would you guys mind if I deleted that file? 
2018-03-16 10:17:46	Jesse	We may want to ask the professor about this... I worry our games are too different. 
2018-03-17 00:11:58	ajshryoc	You can delete cardsTest.py if no one is using it. I would probably make a new directory in the git repo called 'project3' or something so that we have a record of both of our submissions. As for the issues with the games, if you want to ask him, go ahead. I think we could make it work but I'm sure he could provide some insight. <--- Sorry typed this up about 14 hours ago and never hit send 
2018-03-19 14:19:24	Jesse	We got a 90% it seems on what we submitted for the project. He said he liked our nouns/verbs but was disappointed that we didn't make an FSM. He also linked "Derive Interfaces from Constraints of Data" as if its some reading on moodle or github. 
2018-03-19 14:19:57	Jesse	... I checked both, and I'm not sure what he's talking about 
2018-03-19 14:36:38	ajshryoc	I'm also unsure what he meant by that. Our design did get a shoutout in #proj2_mar1 though so that's pretty cool 
2018-03-19 14:38:04	Jesse	i didn't see that. that is pretty cool 
2018-03-19 14:38:44	ajshryoc	Also, just realized the section the he references is also in that Google doc with the feedback 
2018-03-19 15:03:59	jwstanl3	Even after looking at that section, I'm still not sure what he wants us to get from that. The lines he references are where the suits are printed in Crazy Eights to allow the user to select which suit to change to. I don't get how that could be changed. 
2018-03-19 16:30:23	ajshryoc	It could definitely be made better. I think the whole system, crazy eights especially, could benefit from state machines. I intended to cleanup some of that code, but I decided to just wait until this upcoming submission. I'll take a better look at the comments later 
2018-03-19 17:59:01	Jesse	I'm not sure I know how the system could be improved with FSMs. But if you know what you'd like to change, I could definitely help out with that. The issue I see with FSMs is that only crazy eights would use it... and it would just be wasted code for solitaire. 
2018-03-19 19:10:58	ajshryoc	I'm sure he'll provide more context tomorrow. I'll review their comments too and we can go from there 
2018-03-20 10:11:37	Jesse	Hey guys, I was checking out a few other peoples code, and i found one where they built the FSM setup stuff, and didn't call it anywhere in their code xD. I wonder if the graders caught it.

2018-01-23 17:45:08	Jesse	Hello 
2018-01-27 17:50:56	Jesse	we should probably figure out what 2 card games we are going to choose. 
2018-01-27 17:52:53	Jesse	so one has to be some variant of a game which I forgot the name to.. and the other could be anything that involves the standard 52 deck of cards. 
2018-01-27 17:58:05	Jesse	I'm thinking solitaire or some variant of it would be pretty easy to program. 
2018-01-27 18:00:03	Jesse	it wouldnt be as easy as something like blackjack or go fish but those ones are already taken. 
2018-01-27 20:53:36	ajshryoc	I'm cool with solitaire. The game you forgot the name to is Bartok. A Bartok variant I would suggest we annotate would be Crazy Eights. 
2018-01-27 20:54:10	Jesse	im not familiar with either of the two games 
2018-01-27 20:54:36	ajshryoc	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crazy_Eights
2018-01-27 20:54:36		Wikipedia: Crazy Eights
2018-01-27 20:54:36		Crazy Eights is a shedding-type card game for two to seven players. The object of the game is to be the first to get rid of all the player's cards to a discard pile. The game is considered a pre-extension of Switch and Mau Mau.
2018-01-27 20:54:36		A standard 52-card deck is used when there are five or fewer players. When there are more than five players, two decks are shuffled together and all 104 cards are used. 
2018-01-27 20:54:59	ajshryoc	Not familiar with solitaire? Or Bartok? 
2018-01-27 22:25:26	Jesse	bartok and crazy eight. 
2018-01-28 20:18:47	ajshryoc	Bartok is just the game where you have a hand and have to play cards that match a card with the same suit/rank until you run out of cards. Crazy Eights is just that with a couple of other additions, if I remember 
2018-01-28 20:33:54	Jesse	gotcha. well it may make it difficult if we choose a game vastly different from that, so idk if solitaire is a good idea... but I'm sure we could do it if we cant find a better game. 
2018-01-28 20:54:33	ajshryoc	I mean, technically our language should be able to create any kind of game so having two very different games to base it off of might actually be beneficial, although a little more work for the annotation. 
2018-01-28 20:55:28	Jesse	should we call dibs on solitaire then in the proj1 channel? 
2018-01-28 20:57:45	ajshryoc	I'm cool with that 
2018-01-28 21:11:35	ajshryoc	Do we have to claim both games? Or just the non-Bartok clone one? 
2018-01-28 21:12:15	Jesse	i guess juat the non-bartok 
2018-01-28 21:12:27	Jesse	just* 
2018-01-29 17:21:22	Jesse	When can you guys meet up to work on the card game annotations? 
2018-01-29 17:22:08	Jesse	I'm free up until 4:30 on thursday. 
2018-01-29 17:22:23	Jesse	or any time on friday 
2018-01-29 17:30:09	ajshryoc	Between 2 and 4:30 on Thursday works for me 
2018-01-29 17:33:21	Jesse	sounds good to me. 
2018-01-29 17:49:17	jwstanl3	I'm busy 2-6pm pretty much everyday except for Friday 
2018-01-29 17:50:03	Jesse	id be willing to meet up on friday. what about you andrew? 
2018-01-29 17:53:51	ajshryoc	I've got senior design 10:40-12:30 on friday and I typically work afterwards. I could meet before class if that is an option for you guys? Another suggestion would be after class Thursday 
2018-01-29 17:54:37	jwstanl3	I can meet after class Thursday 
2018-01-29 17:54:48	Jesse	Yeah I can do that 
2018-01-29 17:55:25	ajshryoc	Alright, cool 
2018-02-01 20:59:14	Jesse	hey guys, I put in a little bit at the end of the card game annotations. please check if theres anything you'd like to add or modify. 
2018-02-01 21:35:25	ajshryoc	That part looks good and I think was a smart addition 
2018-02-01 21:35:41	Jesse	thank you 
2018-02-01 21:37:41	ajshryoc	I will probably go back to this throughout the weekend if I think of more similarities/differences to add. Overall though, I think it looks good. I probably won't be able to put in a good chunk of time on this assignment until Monday, but I don't think it'll take that long to write out what we already have. 
2018-02-01 21:38:41	Jesse	when you mean write out, do you mean hand-written? 
2018-02-01 21:39:15	ajshryoc	Sorry, I mean like write out in a sentence rather than just a list 
2018-02-01 21:40:00	Jesse	Ahh.. I'm not too sure its important to have it in sentence form, but if you think that would be better, go for it xD 
2018-02-01 21:40:48	Jesse	i can of course help too.. just want to be sure thats something you think is important 
2018-02-01 21:42:56	ajshryoc	I suppose he doesn't really say what format it should be in and only says "list what is similar, what is different", so I'm not entirely sure what he's looking for. I think as long as it's clear we can have it in list form, maybe just with an intro paragraph for each section. 
2018-02-01 21:45:00	Jesse	I don't think he knows what he is looking for lol. And I'm not too sure what I would put in an intro paragraph. 
2018-02-01 23:04:13	ajshryoc	Yeah, good point. We can see how it is and how much time we want to put in next week. 
2018-02-05 21:28:33	ajshryoc	I'm working on the annotations a litte. Just trying to add some more words to the game descriptions. Let me know what you guys think and feel free to add anything 
2018-02-06 19:31:23	ajshryoc	I made a couple small additions to the annotation. Mainly just for formatting/flow. Let me know what you guys think and add whatever else you think we need. If you guys think it's good, I can submit the doc 
2018-02-06 20:39:28	Jesse	ill take a look now. sorry i was distracted 
2018-02-06 20:44:36	Jesse	well dang. thats a lot more of an improvement than i was expecting. Nice work Andrew  
2018-02-06 20:45:22	jwstanl3	Everything looks good 
2018-02-06 20:47:21	Jesse	yeah I agree. 
2018-02-06 20:48:54	Jesse	would you like me to submit? 
2018-02-06 20:49:09	ajshryoc	Thanks, just took what we had before and made it flow a little better  
2018-02-06 20:49:18	ajshryoc	Yeah, go ahead and submit if you want 
2018-02-06 20:50:39	Jesse	done 
2018-02-06 20:50:49	ajshryoc	Sweet 
2018-02-11 09:22:16	Jesse	Hey guys do either of you understand the homework? 
2018-02-11 11:38:18	ajshryoc	I have not taken a look at it so far. I just saw that Alex Phelps posted some tips in #homework that seemed helpful. Will probably get to the homework later today or tomorrow 
2018-02-11 11:49:28	Jesse	yeah. i gotcha 
2018-02-12 21:17:50	ajshryoc	Have you guys finished the homework? I think I've got it---it looks like it's behaving correctly, but I'm not sure what he wants exactly 
2018-02-13 10:43:30	Jesse	I submitted something but I don't think it's right at all. I just made the program look like it was doing something right and submittted it. 
2018-02-13 14:46:06	Jesse	I just pushed  a starter to our cardgame project in our github repo. check it out when ya get the chance. i was just sketching some things up so feel free to modify whatever. 
2018-02-13 15:46:25	ajshryoc	Okay, I'll check it out 
2018-02-14 21:35:45	ajshryoc	@ajshryoc shared a file: https://plm18.slack.com/files/U8M1VEVT3/F98NZUTNC/CSC495_Project_Todo_List (CSC495 Project Todo List) 
2018-02-14 21:35:45		@ajshryoc commented on @ajshryoc?s file https://plm18.slack.com/files/U8M1VEVT3/F98NZUTNC/CSC495_Project_Todo_List (CSC495 Project Todo List): Hey guys, I did a little design work on an approach I've thought of for implementing the two games based on some stuff we've talked about in class. I mainly just tried to break down the game object that were suggested we use in class in the context of a finite state machine. Let me know what you think and if you have suggestions/feedback. We could then write this up as GitHub issues. That way, we can assign things as tasks. 
2018-02-14 21:42:45	Jesse	thats a pretty solid writeup. I'll spend some more time looking over it later.  I think the most complex thing is going to be implementing rules and goals since they can vary  a lot from game to game. 
2018-02-14 21:44:58	ajshryoc	I agree. That along with what constitutes a valid move---especially with solitaire. 
2018-02-15 14:40:27	Jesse	hey guys, i'm gonna be late to class today. I've got a video call with the people i'll be interning with from 3:30 to 4:30. 
2018-02-16 00:07:50	ajshryoc	added an integration to this channel: https://plm18.slack.com/services/B9A0YJ9V1 (github) 
2018-02-16 00:12:00	ajshryoc	I've converted the list I wrote up yesterday into a few GitHub issues. Please feel free to take a look and modify if you see fit. With these we can more easily divide up tasks (or subtasks) and tag commits/branches with them. I also added the GitHub app to this channel, which will post when events happen on the repo. If it starts to get annoying, I can reduce the notifications or turn it off. Figured I'd give it a shot and see if it's useful for keeping everyone up to date on code changes 
2018-02-16 10:06:31	Jesse	I'll start working on this tomorrow. I'm dedicating today to English 331 and research. thanks for this Andrew. [:+1:1] 
2018-02-17 12:56:28	Jesse	I'm gonna be working on this project starting now. I'll try to document my work here. I'm willing to meet up at Hunt if you guys are interested, but it's not necessary. 
2018-02-17 13:04:31	ajshryoc	Sweet. I may work on this depending on how quickly I can do my networks homework today.  
2018-02-17 13:07:13	Jesse	Ok. I'm gonna be looking more into higher level design aspects rather than implementation. I'll let you know what I find. [:+1:1] 
2018-02-17 14:19:00	Jesse	I think I've worked out most of the ambiguous stuff. i can try to upload my notes but it is quite illegible, so ill have to meet with you guys some time to explain.
2018-02-17 14:19:00		Once I work out the rest of the thinking stuff, Ill try to lay out what needs to be done in the form of  a informal UML diagram. From there, I'm going to give out some tasks as far as implementation of this UML. 
2018-02-17 14:19:00		this is my goal for today.

2018-02-17 17:47:09	Jesse	Hey guys, I pushed my UML diagram. Tomorrow I'll handle some of the basic classes like hand, pile, deck and whatever. I also assigned myself to the UI task. 
2018-02-17 17:47:30	ajshryoc	Hey @jwstanl3, which one of the two games would you like to work on? 
2018-02-17 20:14:45	jwstanl3	I'll look into Solitaire. Sorry for taking so long to reply.

2018-02-19 10:14:55	Jesse	I dont think I updated you guys on what I did in that commit. I implemented the basic structure and started on the solitaire UI. I left the rulebook and other game specific things unimplemented. I would also like to expand the basic structures functionality to things like flipping over a card or moving sets of cards from one pile to another pile. 
2018-02-19 17:12:34	ajshryoc	Yeah, added functionality like that would be great. I'm not sure how difficult it would be, but it would be cool if the Pile class was iterable so that you could use it in a for loop. If it too complicated to add that don't worry about it

2018-02-19 21:24:57	Jesse	I added functionality for piles giving one card or giving a set of cards. [:+1:1]

2018-02-19 21:56:00	Jesse	the UI for solitaire is starting to look good. 
2018-02-19 21:56:28	ajshryoc	Yeah, nice! 
2018-02-19 22:03:59	Jesse	I'm not gonna lie, the base code is a lil messy, so if theres any general features that you think needs to be in there just let me know and I can implement it. 
2018-02-19 22:04:46	Jesse	as for the UI, I'm making it so you guys just pass in a set of piles. and the index in the set of piles will determine which pile is positioned where. 
2018-02-19 22:05:46	Jesse	I also hardcoded the height of the board since we know that there will be no higher stack of cards than 13 (which is Ace-King) in solitaire 
2018-02-19 22:07:38	ajshryoc	That would be pretty sweet if we just have to pass in the piles. I think it looks pretty good. We can worry about code cleanup later too. 
2018-02-19 22:09:08	ajshryoc	I was able to get crazy eights working with just 1 player playing cards on the pile, so it looks like we're in a pretty good spot for this project 
2018-02-19 22:09:23	Jesse	dang really? thats pretty awesome 
2018-02-19 22:10:43	ajshryoc	It'll be a cool project once it's all working. The way we have it setup (with your cards.py objects) made it pretty straightforward to program 
2018-02-19 22:10:45	Jesse	can you tell me what the board would look like for crazy eight? is it just a pile for taking cards and a pile for laying cards? also displaying the hand to the player? 
2018-02-19 22:13:53	ajshryoc	@ajshryoc uploaded a file: https://plm18.slack.com/files/U8M1VEVT3/F9ATPNWBS/crazyeights.jpg (crazyeights.JPG) and commented: Here's what I've been using as a sort of debug UI.  So, there's the pile for taking cards, pile for playing cards, and the player's hand. I'm unsure how to handle the computer players since the number of card they hold is definitely relevant to the player. 
2018-02-19 22:14:54	ajshryoc	I think just listing the AI players and showing how many face down cards are in their hands on different lines would be good enough 
2018-02-19 22:16:20	ajshryoc	As a side note, I defined a Move as a Crazy Eights specific object (although it might be worth pulling out) that is defined by a Card, a "to" Pile, and a "from" Pile. It has a method called "make" that will remove the Card from "from" Pile and add it to "to" Pile. This kinda thing might be useful for solitaire too  (edited)
2018-02-19 22:17:59	Jesse	oh. I made a similar function in my Pile class (giveOneCard) 
2018-02-19 22:19:01	ajshryoc	No problem, that totally works. I'll adjust what I've got to match your code once I pull it in 
2018-02-19 22:19:20	Jesse	Would you guys be willing to meet up tomorrow so that we can clean up our code? / continue developing? 
2018-02-19 22:19:32	Jesse	I'm good all day except class time 
2018-02-19 22:20:10	ajshryoc	I'm good from around 1:30 to class time

2018-02-20 07:46:29	jwstanl3	Would you guys be able to meet after class? I have a class from 1:30-2:45 and then I tutor from 3-4 
2018-02-20 10:30:28	Jesse	Yeah. Would you be able to meet after class andrew? I don't think we need a lot of time. My plan was just to use an hour or two to clean up some of the code in the generic game structure/UI's and implement any functionality you guys think would be good for both games. 
2018-02-20 10:32:21	Jesse	If not, I could meet with andrew an hour before class and then after class with Joseph for an hour. 
2018-02-20 11:36:11	ajshryoc	I could meet briefly right after class

2018-02-20 12:00:47	jwstanl3	I have the solitaire game pretty much working completely, but I changed some things in the cards and SolitaireUI files, so I'll wait until we meet to commit anything 
2018-02-20 12:03:24	jwstanl3	@jwstanl3 uploaded a file: https://plm18.slack.com/files/U8N1B358V/F9B8MRFL0/solitaire.gif (Solitaire GIF) and commented: Here's a GIF of the game.  The only thing I haven't implemented is win and loss states. 
2018-02-20 13:05:32	Jesse	thats awesome!! but arent the red cards supposed to go on black cards and vice versa? 
2018-02-20 13:05:45	Jesse	its okay if we want to change it for the sake of project scope 
2018-02-20 13:05:53	Jesse	to be red on red 
2018-02-20 13:08:42	jwstanl3	The rules from Bicycle didn't have any restrictions on color. It just had to be consecutive. But, yea, normally you would alternate colors, and it would be pretty easy to switch the program to follow that. 
2018-02-20 13:09:15	jwstanl3	The game's really easy at the moment, so adding something like that would help it be more challenging.

2018-02-21 20:28:57	jwstanl3	I pushed some fixes to my solitaire code. Cards have to alternate in color now in the stacks. There were a few other bugs I fixed. I still haven't added a win state, or a loss state really, but it should be able to detect a win or loss, if the loss state doesn't have any moves left. I haven't been able to beat the game since adding the alternating colors, so I'm not sure if this is true or not.

2018-02-24 12:28:32	Jesse	Do you guys understand python decorators? I haven't been able to reproduce a function that demonstrates the difference with/without the decorator. 
2018-02-25 20:28:31	ajshryoc	Sorry, intended to respond, then totally forgot about this. My understanding of python decorators is it's just another form of syntax for calling functions; however, it sort of ties two functions together and modifies the function being decorated. Here's an article I found that gives a good explanation on the subject: http://python-3-patterns-idioms-test.readthedocs.io/en/latest/PythonDecorators.html

2018-02-25 22:39:22	ajshryoc	Just pushed the finished version of Crazy Eights. It's kinda a mess, so I'll probably do some refactoring of it at some point. I also modified cards.py to print out the unicode symbol corresponding to the card's suit. I was curious about how to do it and it turned out to be really easy, so I added it. I think it makes it much easier to see the cards 
2018-02-25 22:41:04	Jesse	oh nice!!! let me know if theres anything youd like me to change.  
2018-02-26 13:50:38	Jesse	I played both crazy eights and solitaire and I haven't noticed any bugs. winning looks good as well. 
2018-02-26 13:52:31	Jesse	we may be able to polish a few things up but honestly, it doesn't matter too much because we'll be taking parts of our code out and re implementing stuff for the second submission. I think what we have is gold. If there's anything you guys want me to change, just let me know. 
2018-02-26 17:12:29	ajshryoc	Glad you liked it! I think they both play pretty well 
2018-03-12 13:07:36	Jesse	Hey guys, we need to figure out what we need to submit and submit it before class tomorrow. 
2018-03-12 13:11:03	Jesse	Do you guys have the transcript of the 2 games? if not I can make them. 
2018-03-12 13:12:50	ajshryoc	I don't have a transcript. You should be able to use the tee command to output to a file and stdout 
2018-03-12 13:13:04	Jesse	I was just gonna use script 
2018-03-12 13:13:18	Jesse	it automatically outputs the log to a file 
2018-03-12 13:13:31	ajshryoc	Yeah, whatever works 
2018-03-12 13:13:53	Jesse	alright. 
2018-03-12 13:24:42	ajshryoc	Thanks 
2018-03-12 13:29:54	Jesse	I've got the two for crazy eights done. solitaire will take some more time [:+1:1]

2018-03-12 14:41:24	Jesse	Alright, the transcripts are made. Can someone else do the work of submitting and making a cheap readme with some basic information like linking to the transcript file and how to run each of the games? 
2018-03-12 14:42:00	Jesse	that solitaire is makin my eyes hurt haha. 
2018-03-12 14:49:16	ajshryoc	Yeah, I can do that later

2018-03-16 10:06:54	Jesse	I'm gonna take a look now about what we can do to our project for submission 3. 
2018-03-16 10:13:12	Jesse	Nobody but me used cardsTest.py right? would you guys mind if I deleted that file? 
2018-03-16 10:17:46	Jesse	We may want to ask the professor about this... I worry our games are too different. 
2018-03-17 00:11:58	ajshryoc	You can delete cardsTest.py if no one is using it. I would probably make a new directory in the git repo called 'project3' or something so that we have a record of both of our submissions. As for the issues with the games, if you want to ask him, go ahead. I think we could make it work but I'm sure he could provide some insight. <--- Sorry typed this up about 14 hours ago and never hit send 
2018-03-19 14:19:24	Jesse	We got a 90% it seems on what we submitted for the project. He said he liked our nouns/verbs but was disappointed that we didn't make an FSM. He also linked "Derive Interfaces from Constraints of Data" as if its some reading on moodle or github. 
2018-03-19 14:19:57	Jesse	... I checked both, and I'm not sure what he's talking about 
2018-03-19 14:36:38	ajshryoc	I'm also unsure what he meant by that. Our design did get a shoutout in #proj2_mar1 though so that's pretty cool 
2018-03-19 14:38:04	Jesse	i didn't see that. that is pretty cool 
2018-03-19 14:38:44	ajshryoc	Also, just realized the section the he references is also in that Google doc with the feedback 
2018-03-19 15:03:59	jwstanl3	Even after looking at that section, I'm still not sure what he wants us to get from that. The lines he references are where the suits are printed in Crazy Eights to allow the user to select which suit to change to. I don't get how that could be changed. 
2018-03-19 16:30:23	ajshryoc	It could definitely be made better. I think the whole system, crazy eights especially, could benefit from state machines. I intended to cleanup some of that code, but I decided to just wait until this upcoming submission. I'll take a better look at the comments later 
2018-03-19 17:59:01	Jesse	I'm not sure I know how the system could be improved with FSMs. But if you know what you'd like to change, I could definitely help out with that. The issue I see with FSMs is that only crazy eights would use it... and it would just be wasted code for solitaire. 
2018-03-19 19:10:58	ajshryoc	I'm sure he'll provide more context tomorrow. I'll review their comments too and we can go from there 
2018-03-20 10:11:37	Jesse	Hey guys, I was checking out a few other peoples code, and i found one where they built the FSM setup stuff, and didn't call it anywhere in their code xD. I wonder if the graders caught it.

2018-01-23 17:45:08	Jesse	Hello 
2018-01-27 17:50:56	Jesse	we should probably figure out what 2 card games we are going to choose. 
2018-01-27 17:52:53	Jesse	so one has to be some variant of a game which I forgot the name to.. and the other could be anything that involves the standard 52 deck of cards. 
2018-01-27 17:58:05	Jesse	I'm thinking solitaire or some variant of it would be pretty easy to program. 
2018-01-27 18:00:03	Jesse	it wouldnt be as easy as something like blackjack or go fish but those ones are already taken. 
2018-01-27 20:53:36	ajshryoc	I'm cool with solitaire. The game you forgot the name to is Bartok. A Bartok variant I would suggest we annotate would be Crazy Eights. 
2018-01-27 20:54:10	Jesse	im not familiar with either of the two games 
2018-01-27 20:54:36	ajshryoc	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crazy_Eights
2018-01-27 20:54:36		Wikipedia: Crazy Eights
2018-01-27 20:54:36		Crazy Eights is a shedding-type card game for two to seven players. The object of the game is to be the first to get rid of all the player's cards to a discard pile. The game is considered a pre-extension of Switch and Mau Mau.
2018-01-27 20:54:36		A standard 52-card deck is used when there are five or fewer players. When there are more than five players, two decks are shuffled together and all 104 cards are used. 
2018-01-27 20:54:59	ajshryoc	Not familiar with solitaire? Or Bartok? 
2018-01-27 22:25:26	Jesse	bartok and crazy eight. 
2018-01-28 20:18:47	ajshryoc	Bartok is just the game where you have a hand and have to play cards that match a card with the same suit/rank until you run out of cards. Crazy Eights is just that with a couple of other additions, if I remember 
2018-01-28 20:33:54	Jesse	gotcha. well it may make it difficult if we choose a game vastly different from that, so idk if solitaire is a good idea... but I'm sure we could do it if we cant find a better game. 
2018-01-28 20:54:33	ajshryoc	I mean, technically our language should be able to create any kind of game so having two very different games to base it off of might actually be beneficial, although a little more work for the annotation. 
2018-01-28 20:55:28	Jesse	should we call dibs on solitaire then in the proj1 channel? 
2018-01-28 20:57:45	ajshryoc	I'm cool with that 
2018-01-28 21:11:35	ajshryoc	Do we have to claim both games? Or just the non-Bartok clone one? 
2018-01-28 21:12:15	Jesse	i guess juat the non-bartok 
2018-01-28 21:12:27	Jesse	just* 
2018-01-29 17:21:22	Jesse	When can you guys meet up to work on the card game annotations? 
2018-01-29 17:22:08	Jesse	I'm free up until 4:30 on thursday. 
2018-01-29 17:22:23	Jesse	or any time on friday 
2018-01-29 17:30:09	ajshryoc	Between 2 and 4:30 on Thursday works for me 
2018-01-29 17:33:21	Jesse	sounds good to me. 
2018-01-29 17:49:17	jwstanl3	I'm busy 2-6pm pretty much everyday except for Friday 
2018-01-29 17:50:03	Jesse	id be willing to meet up on friday. what about you andrew? 
2018-01-29 17:53:51	ajshryoc	I've got senior design 10:40-12:30 on friday and I typically work afterwards. I could meet before class if that is an option for you guys? Another suggestion would be after class Thursday 
2018-01-29 17:54:37	jwstanl3	I can meet after class Thursday 
2018-01-29 17:54:48	Jesse	Yeah I can do that 
2018-01-29 17:55:25	ajshryoc	Alright, cool 
2018-02-01 20:59:14	Jesse	hey guys, I put in a little bit at the end of the card game annotations. please check if theres anything you'd like to add or modify. 
2018-02-01 21:35:25	ajshryoc	That part looks good and I think was a smart addition 
2018-02-01 21:35:41	Jesse	thank you 
2018-02-01 21:37:41	ajshryoc	I will probably go back to this throughout the weekend if I think of more similarities/differences to add. Overall though, I think it looks good. I probably won't be able to put in a good chunk of time on this assignment until Monday, but I don't think it'll take that long to write out what we already have. 
2018-02-01 21:38:41	Jesse	when you mean write out, do you mean hand-written? 
2018-02-01 21:39:15	ajshryoc	Sorry, I mean like write out in a sentence rather than just a list 
2018-02-01 21:40:00	Jesse	Ahh.. I'm not too sure its important to have it in sentence form, but if you think that would be better, go for it xD 
2018-02-01 21:40:48	Jesse	i can of course help too.. just want to be sure thats something you think is important 
2018-02-01 21:42:56	ajshryoc	I suppose he doesn't really say what format it should be in and only says "list what is similar, what is different", so I'm not entirely sure what he's looking for. I think as long as it's clear we can have it in list form, maybe just with an intro paragraph for each section. 
2018-02-01 21:45:00	Jesse	I don't think he knows what he is looking for lol. And I'm not too sure what I would put in an intro paragraph. 
2018-02-01 23:04:13	ajshryoc	Yeah, good point. We can see how it is and how much time we want to put in next week. 
2018-02-05 21:28:33	ajshryoc	I'm working on the annotations a litte. Just trying to add some more words to the game descriptions. Let me know what you guys think and feel free to add anything 
2018-02-06 19:31:23	ajshryoc	I made a couple small additions to the annotation. Mainly just for formatting/flow. Let me know what you guys think and add whatever else you think we need. If you guys think it's good, I can submit the doc 
2018-02-06 20:39:28	Jesse	ill take a look now. sorry i was distracted 
2018-02-06 20:44:36	Jesse	well dang. thats a lot more of an improvement than i was expecting. Nice work Andrew  
2018-02-06 20:45:22	jwstanl3	Everything looks good 
2018-02-06 20:47:21	Jesse	yeah I agree. 
2018-02-06 20:48:54	Jesse	would you like me to submit? 
2018-02-06 20:49:09	ajshryoc	Thanks, just took what we had before and made it flow a little better  
2018-02-06 20:49:18	ajshryoc	Yeah, go ahead and submit if you want 
2018-02-06 20:50:39	Jesse	done 
2018-02-06 20:50:49	ajshryoc	Sweet 
2018-02-11 09:22:16	Jesse	Hey guys do either of you understand the homework? 
2018-02-11 11:38:18	ajshryoc	I have not taken a look at it so far. I just saw that Alex Phelps posted some tips in #homework that seemed helpful. Will probably get to the homework later today or tomorrow 
2018-02-11 11:49:28	Jesse	yeah. i gotcha 
2018-02-12 21:17:50	ajshryoc	Have you guys finished the homework? I think I've got it---it looks like it's behaving correctly, but I'm not sure what he wants exactly 
2018-02-13 10:43:30	Jesse	I submitted something but I don't think it's right at all. I just made the program look like it was doing something right and submittted it. 
2018-02-13 14:46:06	Jesse	I just pushed  a starter to our cardgame project in our github repo. check it out when ya get the chance. i was just sketching some things up so feel free to modify whatever. 
2018-02-13 15:46:25	ajshryoc	Okay, I'll check it out 
2018-02-14 21:35:45	ajshryoc	@ajshryoc shared a file: https://plm18.slack.com/files/U8M1VEVT3/F98NZUTNC/CSC495_Project_Todo_List (CSC495 Project Todo List) 
2018-02-14 21:35:45		@ajshryoc commented on @ajshryoc?s file https://plm18.slack.com/files/U8M1VEVT3/F98NZUTNC/CSC495_Project_Todo_List (CSC495 Project Todo List): Hey guys, I did a little design work on an approach I've thought of for implementing the two games based on some stuff we've talked about in class. I mainly just tried to break down the game object that were suggested we use in class in the context of a finite state machine. Let me know what you think and if you have suggestions/feedback. We could then write this up as GitHub issues. That way, we can assign things as tasks. 
2018-02-14 21:42:45	Jesse	thats a pretty solid writeup. I'll spend some more time looking over it later.  I think the most complex thing is going to be implementing rules and goals since they can vary  a lot from game to game. 
2018-02-14 21:44:58	ajshryoc	I agree. That along with what constitutes a valid move---especially with solitaire. 
2018-02-15 14:40:27	Jesse	hey guys, i'm gonna be late to class today. I've got a video call with the people i'll be interning with from 3:30 to 4:30. 
2018-02-16 00:07:50	ajshryoc	added an integration to this channel: https://plm18.slack.com/services/B9A0YJ9V1 (github) 
2018-02-16 00:12:00	ajshryoc	I've converted the list I wrote up yesterday into a few GitHub issues. Please feel free to take a look and modify if you see fit. With these we can more easily divide up tasks (or subtasks) and tag commits/branches with them. I also added the GitHub app to this channel, which will post when events happen on the repo. If it starts to get annoying, I can reduce the notifications or turn it off. Figured I'd give it a shot and see if it's useful for keeping everyone up to date on code changes 
2018-02-16 10:06:31	Jesse	I'll start working on this tomorrow. I'm dedicating today to English 331 and research. thanks for this Andrew. [:+1:1] 
2018-02-17 12:56:28	Jesse	I'm gonna be working on this project starting now. I'll try to document my work here. I'm willing to meet up at Hunt if you guys are interested, but it's not necessary. 
2018-02-17 13:04:31	ajshryoc	Sweet. I may work on this depending on how quickly I can do my networks homework today.  
2018-02-17 13:07:13	Jesse	Ok. I'm gonna be looking more into higher level design aspects rather than implementation. I'll let you know what I find. [:+1:1] 
2018-02-17 14:19:00	Jesse	I think I've worked out most of the ambiguous stuff. i can try to upload my notes but it is quite illegible, so ill have to meet with you guys some time to explain.
2018-02-17 14:19:00		Once I work out the rest of the thinking stuff, Ill try to lay out what needs to be done in the form of  a informal UML diagram. From there, I'm going to give out some tasks as far as implementation of this UML. 
2018-02-17 14:19:00		this is my goal for today.

2018-02-19 10:14:55	Jesse	I dont think I updated you guys on what I did in that commit. I implemented the basic structure and started on the solitaire UI. I left the rulebook and other game specific things unimplemented. I would also like to expand the basic structures functionality to things like flipping over a card or moving sets of cards from one pile to another pile. 
2018-02-19 17:12:34	ajshryoc	Yeah, added functionality like that would be great. I'm not sure how difficult it would be, but it would be cool if the Pile class was iterable so that you could use it in a for loop. If it too complicated to add that don't worry about it

2018-02-19 21:24:57	Jesse	I added functionality for piles giving one card or giving a set of cards. [:+1:1]

2018-02-19 21:56:00	Jesse	the UI for solitaire is starting to look good. 
2018-02-19 21:56:28	ajshryoc	Yeah, nice! 
2018-02-19 22:03:59	Jesse	I'm not gonna lie, the base code is a lil messy, so if theres any general features that you think needs to be in there just let me know and I can implement it. 
2018-02-19 22:04:46	Jesse	as for the UI, I'm making it so you guys just pass in a set of piles. and the index in the set of piles will determine which pile is positioned where. 
2018-02-19 22:05:46	Jesse	I also hardcoded the height of the board since we know that there will be no higher stack of cards than 13 (which is Ace-King) in solitaire 
2018-02-19 22:07:38	ajshryoc	That would be pretty sweet if we just have to pass in the piles. I think it looks pretty good. We can worry about code cleanup later too. 
2018-02-19 22:09:08	ajshryoc	I was able to get crazy eights working with just 1 player playing cards on the pile, so it looks like we're in a pretty good spot for this project 
2018-02-19 22:09:23	Jesse	dang really? thats pretty awesome 
2018-02-19 22:10:43	ajshryoc	It'll be a cool project once it's all working. The way we have it setup (with your cards.py objects) made it pretty straightforward to program 
2018-02-19 22:10:45	Jesse	can you tell me what the board would look like for crazy eight? is it just a pile for taking cards and a pile for laying cards? also displaying the hand to the player? 
2018-02-19 22:13:53	ajshryoc	@ajshryoc uploaded a file: https://plm18.slack.com/files/U8M1VEVT3/F9ATPNWBS/crazyeights.jpg (crazyeights.JPG) and commented: Here's what I've been using as a sort of debug UI.  So, there's the pile for taking cards, pile for playing cards, and the player's hand. I'm unsure how to handle the computer players since the number of card they hold is definitely relevant to the player. 
2018-02-19 22:14:54	ajshryoc	I think just listing the AI players and showing how many face down cards are in their hands on different lines would be good enough 
2018-02-19 22:16:20	ajshryoc	As a side note, I defined a Move as a Crazy Eights specific object (although it might be worth pulling out) that is defined by a Card, a "to" Pile, and a "from" Pile. It has a method called "make" that will remove the Card from "from" Pile and add it to "to" Pile. This kinda thing might be useful for solitaire too  (edited)
2018-02-19 22:17:59	Jesse	oh. I made a similar function in my Pile class (giveOneCard) 
2018-02-19 22:19:01	ajshryoc	No problem, that totally works. I'll adjust what I've got to match your code once I pull it in 
2018-02-19 22:19:20	Jesse	Would you guys be willing to meet up tomorrow so that we can clean up our code? / continue developing? 
2018-02-19 22:19:32	Jesse	I'm good all day except class time 
2018-02-19 22:20:10	ajshryoc	I'm good from around 1:30 to class time 
2018-02-19 22:24:03	Jesse	okay. I'd be down to meet then.

2018-02-20 07:46:29	jwstanl3	Would you guys be able to meet after class? I have a class from 1:30-2:45 and then I tutor from 3-4 
2018-02-20 10:30:28	Jesse	Yeah. Would you be able to meet after class andrew? I don't think we need a lot of time. My plan was just to use an hour or two to clean up some of the code in the generic game structure/UI's and implement any functionality you guys think would be good for both games. 
2018-02-20 10:32:21	Jesse	If not, I could meet with andrew an hour before class and then after class with Joseph for an hour. 
2018-02-20 11:36:11	ajshryoc	I could meet briefly right after class 
2018-02-20 11:36:34	Jesse	cool! 
2018-02-20 12:00:47	jwstanl3	I have the solitaire game pretty much working completely, but I changed some things in the cards and SolitaireUI files, so I'll wait until we meet to commit anything

2018-02-20 13:05:32	Jesse	thats awesome!! but arent the red cards supposed to go on black cards and vice versa? 
2018-02-20 13:05:45	Jesse	its okay if we want to change it for the sake of project scope 
2018-02-20 13:05:53	Jesse	to be red on red 
2018-02-20 13:08:42	jwstanl3	The rules from Bicycle didn't have any restrictions on color. It just had to be consecutive. But, yea, normally you would alternate colors, and it would be pretty easy to switch the program to follow that. 
2018-02-20 13:09:15	jwstanl3	The game's really easy at the moment, so adding something like that would help it be more challenging.

2018-02-21 20:28:57	jwstanl3	I pushed some fixes to my solitaire code. Cards have to alternate in color now in the stacks. There were a few other bugs I fixed. I still haven't added a win state, or a loss state really, but it should be able to detect a win or loss, if the loss state doesn't have any moves left. I haven't been able to beat the game since adding the alternating colors, so I'm not sure if this is true or not.

2018-02-22 22:08:38	ajshryoc	Added what I have for crazy eights. I think the only major feature missing is the suit change when playing an 8. I also intend to clean up the code and little bit to get rid of redundancy.  (edited)

2018-02-24 12:28:32	Jesse	Do you guys understand python decorators? I haven't been able to reproduce a function that demonstrates the difference with/without the decorator. 
2018-02-25 20:28:31	ajshryoc	Sorry, intended to respond, then totally forgot about this. My understanding of python decorators is it's just another form of syntax for calling functions; however, it sort of ties two functions together and modifies the function being decorated. Here's an article I found that gives a good explanation on the subject: http://python-3-patterns-idioms-test.readthedocs.io/en/latest/PythonDecorators.html

2018-02-25 22:39:22	ajshryoc	Just pushed the finished version of Crazy Eights. It's kinda a mess, so I'll probably do some refactoring of it at some point. I also modified cards.py to print out the unicode symbol corresponding to the card's suit. I was curious about how to do it and it turned out to be really easy, so I added it. I think it makes it much easier to see the cards 
2018-02-25 22:41:04	Jesse	oh nice!!! let me know if theres anything youd like me to change.  
2018-02-26 13:50:38	Jesse	I played both crazy eights and solitaire and I haven't noticed any bugs. winning looks good as well. 
2018-02-26 13:52:31	Jesse	we may be able to polish a few things up but honestly, it doesn't matter too much because we'll be taking parts of our code out and re implementing stuff for the second submission.

2018-03-16 10:13:12	Jesse	Nobody but me used cardsTest.py right? would you guys mind if I deleted that file? 
2018-03-16 10:17:46	Jesse	We may want to ask the professor about this... I worry our games are too different. 
2018-03-17 00:11:58	ajshryoc	You can delete cardsTest.py if no one is using it. I would probably make a new directory in the git repo called 'project3' or something so that we have a record of both of our submissions. As for the issues with the games, if you want to ask him, go ahead. I think we could make it work but I'm sure he could provide some insight. <--- Sorry typed this up about 14 hours ago and never hit send 
2018-03-19 14:19:24	Jesse	We got a 90% it seems on what we submitted for the project. He said he liked our nouns/verbs but was disappointed that we didn't make an FSM. He also linked "Derive Interfaces from Constraints of Data" as if its some reading on moodle or github. 
2018-03-19 14:19:57	Jesse	... I checked both, and I'm not sure what he's talking about 
2018-03-19 14:36:38	ajshryoc	I'm also unsure what he meant by that. Our design did get a shoutout in #proj2_mar1 though so that's pretty cool 
2018-03-19 14:38:04	Jesse	i didn't see that. that is pretty cool 
2018-03-19 14:38:44	ajshryoc	Also, just realized the section the he references is also in that Google doc with the feedback 
2018-03-19 15:03:59	jwstanl3	Even after looking at that section, I'm still not sure what he wants us to get from that. The lines he references are where the suits are printed in Crazy Eights to allow the user to select which suit to change to. I don't get how that could be changed. 
2018-03-19 16:30:23	ajshryoc	It could definitely be made better. I think the whole system, crazy eights especially, could benefit from state machines. I intended to cleanup some of that code, but I decided to just wait until this upcoming submission. I'll take a better look at the comments later 
2018-03-19 17:59:01	Jesse	I'm not sure I know how the system could be improved with FSMs. But if you know what you'd like to change, I could definitely help out with that. The issue I see with FSMs is that only crazy eights would use it... and it would just be wasted code for solitaire. 
2018-03-19 19:10:58	ajshryoc	I'm sure he'll provide more context tomorrow. I'll review their comments too and we can go from there 
2018-03-20 10:11:37	Jesse	Hey guys, I was checking out a few other peoples code, and i found one where they built the FSM setup stuff, and didn't call it anywhere in their code xD. I wonder if the graders caught it.

2018-03-20 22:06:59	Jesse	Hey guys, I can't figure out these imports and __init__.py stuff. I did restructure the directory a bit, but without the imports working correctly, nothing will run. Would you guys like me to push this so you can take a look?

2018-03-21 12:56:29	Jesse	I figured it out. 
2018-03-21 13:37:07	ajshryoc	Sorry I missed your other message. Nice job getting it to work though. I'm not too familiar with __init__.py type files myself 
2018-03-21 13:49:42	Jesse	pretty sure theyre empty... but they work

2018-01-23 17:45:08	Jesse	Hello 
2018-01-27 17:50:56	Jesse	we should probably figure out what 2 card games we are going to choose. 
2018-01-27 17:52:53	Jesse	so one has to be some variant of a game which I forgot the name to.. and the other could be anything that involves the standard 52 deck of cards. 
2018-01-27 17:58:05	Jesse	I'm thinking solitaire or some variant of it would be pretty easy to program. 
2018-01-27 18:00:03	Jesse	it wouldnt be as easy as something like blackjack or go fish but those ones are already taken. 
2018-01-27 20:53:36	ajshryoc	I'm cool with solitaire. The game you forgot the name to is Bartok. A Bartok variant I would suggest we annotate would be Crazy Eights. 
2018-01-27 20:54:10	Jesse	im not familiar with either of the two games 
2018-01-27 20:54:36	ajshryoc	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crazy_Eights
2018-01-27 20:54:36		Wikipedia: Crazy Eights
2018-01-27 20:54:36		Crazy Eights is a shedding-type card game for two to seven players. The object of the game is to be the first to get rid of all the player's cards to a discard pile. The game is considered a pre-extension of Switch and Mau Mau.
2018-01-27 20:54:36		A standard 52-card deck is used when there are five or fewer players. When there are more than five players, two decks are shuffled together and all 104 cards are used. 
2018-01-27 20:54:59	ajshryoc	Not familiar with solitaire? Or Bartok? 
2018-01-27 22:25:26	Jesse	bartok and crazy eight. 
2018-01-28 20:18:47	ajshryoc	Bartok is just the game where you have a hand and have to play cards that match a card with the same suit/rank until you run out of cards. Crazy Eights is just that with a couple of other additions, if I remember 
2018-01-28 20:33:54	Jesse	gotcha. well it may make it difficult if we choose a game vastly different from that, so idk if solitaire is a good idea... but I'm sure we could do it if we cant find a better game. 
2018-01-28 20:54:33	ajshryoc	I mean, technically our language should be able to create any kind of game so having two very different games to base it off of might actually be beneficial, although a little more work for the annotation. 
2018-01-28 20:55:28	Jesse	should we call dibs on solitaire then in the proj1 channel? 
2018-01-28 20:57:45	ajshryoc	I'm cool with that 
2018-01-28 21:11:35	ajshryoc	Do we have to claim both games? Or just the non-Bartok clone one? 
2018-01-28 21:12:15	Jesse	i guess juat the non-bartok 
2018-01-28 21:12:27	Jesse	just* 
2018-01-29 17:21:22	Jesse	When can you guys meet up to work on the card game annotations? 
2018-01-29 17:22:08	Jesse	I'm free up until 4:30 on thursday. 
2018-01-29 17:22:23	Jesse	or any time on friday 
2018-01-29 17:30:09	ajshryoc	Between 2 and 4:30 on Thursday works for me 
2018-01-29 17:33:21	Jesse	sounds good to me. 
2018-01-29 17:49:17	jwstanl3	I'm busy 2-6pm pretty much everyday except for Friday 
2018-01-29 17:50:03	Jesse	id be willing to meet up on friday. what about you andrew? 
2018-01-29 17:53:51	ajshryoc	I've got senior design 10:40-12:30 on friday and I typically work afterwards. I could meet before class if that is an option for you guys? Another suggestion would be after class Thursday 
2018-01-29 17:54:37	jwstanl3	I can meet after class Thursday 
2018-01-29 17:54:48	Jesse	Yeah I can do that 
2018-01-29 17:55:25	ajshryoc	Alright, cool 
2018-02-01 20:59:14	Jesse	hey guys, I put in a little bit at the end of the card game annotations. please check if theres anything you'd like to add or modify. 
2018-02-01 21:35:25	ajshryoc	That part looks good and I think was a smart addition 
2018-02-01 21:35:41	Jesse	thank you 
2018-02-01 21:37:41	ajshryoc	I will probably go back to this throughout the weekend if I think of more similarities/differences to add. Overall though, I think it looks good. I probably won't be able to put in a good chunk of time on this assignment until Monday, but I don't think it'll take that long to write out what we already have. 
2018-02-01 21:38:41	Jesse	when you mean write out, do you mean hand-written? 
2018-02-01 21:39:15	ajshryoc	Sorry, I mean like write out in a sentence rather than just a list 
2018-02-01 21:40:00	Jesse	Ahh.. I'm not too sure its important to have it in sentence form, but if you think that would be better, go for it xD 
2018-02-01 21:40:48	Jesse	i can of course help too.. just want to be sure thats something you think is important 
2018-02-01 21:42:56	ajshryoc	I suppose he doesn't really say what format it should be in and only says "list what is similar, what is different", so I'm not entirely sure what he's looking for. I think as long as it's clear we can have it in list form, maybe just with an intro paragraph for each section. 
2018-02-01 21:45:00	Jesse	I don't think he knows what he is looking for lol. And I'm not too sure what I would put in an intro paragraph. 
2018-02-01 23:04:13	ajshryoc	Yeah, good point. We can see how it is and how much time we want to put in next week. 
2018-02-05 21:28:33	ajshryoc	I'm working on the annotations a litte. Just trying to add some more words to the game descriptions. Let me know what you guys think and feel free to add anything 
2018-02-06 19:31:23	ajshryoc	I made a couple small additions to the annotation. Mainly just for formatting/flow. Let me know what you guys think and add whatever else you think we need. If you guys think it's good, I can submit the doc 
2018-02-06 20:39:28	Jesse	ill take a look now. sorry i was distracted 
2018-02-06 20:44:36	Jesse	well dang. thats a lot more of an improvement than i was expecting. Nice work Andrew  
2018-02-06 20:45:22	jwstanl3	Everything looks good 
2018-02-06 20:47:21	Jesse	yeah I agree. 
2018-02-06 20:48:54	Jesse	would you like me to submit? 
2018-02-06 20:49:09	ajshryoc	Thanks, just took what we had before and made it flow a little better  
2018-02-06 20:49:18	ajshryoc	Yeah, go ahead and submit if you want 
2018-02-06 20:50:39	Jesse	done 
2018-02-06 20:50:49	ajshryoc	Sweet 
2018-02-11 09:22:16	Jesse	Hey guys do either of you understand the homework? 
2018-02-11 11:38:18	ajshryoc	I have not taken a look at it so far. I just saw that Alex Phelps posted some tips in #homework that seemed helpful. Will probably get to the homework later today or tomorrow 
2018-02-11 11:49:28	Jesse	yeah. i gotcha 
2018-02-12 21:17:50	ajshryoc	Have you guys finished the homework? I think I've got it---it looks like it's behaving correctly, but I'm not sure what he wants exactly 
2018-02-13 10:43:30	Jesse	I submitted something but I don't think it's right at all. I just made the program look like it was doing something right and submittted it. 
2018-02-13 14:46:06	Jesse	I just pushed  a starter to our cardgame project in our github repo. check it out when ya get the chance. i was just sketching some things up so feel free to modify whatever. 
2018-02-13 15:46:25	ajshryoc	Okay, I'll check it out 
2018-02-14 21:35:45	ajshryoc	@ajshryoc shared a file: https://plm18.slack.com/files/U8M1VEVT3/F98NZUTNC/CSC495_Project_Todo_List (CSC495 Project Todo List) 
2018-02-14 21:35:45		@ajshryoc commented on @ajshryoc?s file https://plm18.slack.com/files/U8M1VEVT3/F98NZUTNC/CSC495_Project_Todo_List (CSC495 Project Todo List): Hey guys, I did a little design work on an approach I've thought of for implementing the two games based on some stuff we've talked about in class. I mainly just tried to break down the game object that were suggested we use in class in the context of a finite state machine. Let me know what you think and if you have suggestions/feedback. We could then write this up as GitHub issues. That way, we can assign things as tasks. 
2018-02-14 21:42:45	Jesse	thats a pretty solid writeup. I'll spend some more time looking over it later.  I think the most complex thing is going to be implementing rules and goals since they can vary  a lot from game to game. 
2018-02-14 21:44:58	ajshryoc	I agree. That along with what constitutes a valid move---especially with solitaire. 
2018-02-15 14:40:27	Jesse	hey guys, i'm gonna be late to class today. I've got a video call with the people i'll be interning with from 3:30 to 4:30. 
2018-02-16 00:07:50	ajshryoc	added an integration to this channel: https://plm18.slack.com/services/B9A0YJ9V1 (github) 
2018-02-16 00:12:00	ajshryoc	I've converted the list I wrote up yesterday into a few GitHub issues. Please feel free to take a look and modify if you see fit. With these we can more easily divide up tasks (or subtasks) and tag commits/branches with them. I also added the GitHub app to this channel, which will post when events happen on the repo. If it starts to get annoying, I can reduce the notifications or turn it off. Figured I'd give it a shot and see if it's useful for keeping everyone up to date on code changes 
2018-02-16 10:06:31	Jesse	I'll start working on this tomorrow. I'm dedicating today to English 331 and research. thanks for this Andrew. [:+1:1] 
2018-02-17 12:56:28	Jesse	I'm gonna be working on this project starting now. I'll try to document my work here. I'm willing to meet up at Hunt if you guys are interested, but it's not necessary. 
2018-02-17 13:04:31	ajshryoc	Sweet. I may work on this depending on how quickly I can do my networks homework today.  
2018-02-17 13:07:13	Jesse	Ok. I'm gonna be looking more into higher level design aspects rather than implementation. I'll let you know what I find. [:+1:1] 
2018-02-17 14:19:00	Jesse	I think I've worked out most of the ambiguous stuff. i can try to upload my notes but it is quite illegible, so ill have to meet with you guys some time to explain.
2018-02-17 14:19:00		Once I work out the rest of the thinking stuff, Ill try to lay out what needs to be done in the form of  a informal UML diagram. From there, I'm going to give out some tasks as far as implementation of this UML. 
2018-02-17 14:19:00		this is my goal for today.

2018-02-17 17:47:09	Jesse	Hey guys, I pushed my UML diagram. Tomorrow I'll handle some of the basic classes like hand, pile, deck and whatever. I also assigned myself to the UI task. 
2018-02-17 17:47:30	ajshryoc	Hey @jwstanl3, which one of the two games would you like to work on? 
2018-02-17 20:14:45	jwstanl3	I'll look into Solitaire. Sorry for taking so long to reply.

2018-02-19 10:14:55	Jesse	I dont think I updated you guys on what I did in that commit. I implemented the basic structure and started on the solitaire UI. I left the rulebook and other game specific things unimplemented. I would also like to expand the basic structures functionality to things like flipping over a card or moving sets of cards from one pile to another pile. 
2018-02-19 17:12:34	ajshryoc	Yeah, added functionality like that would be great. I'm not sure how difficult it would be, but it would be cool if the Pile class was iterable so that you could use it in a for loop. If it too complicated to add that don't worry about it

2018-02-19 21:24:57	Jesse	I added functionality for piles giving one card or giving a set of cards. [:+1:1]

2018-02-19 21:56:00	Jesse	the UI for solitaire is starting to look good. 
2018-02-19 21:56:28	ajshryoc	Yeah, nice! 
2018-02-19 22:03:59	Jesse	I'm not gonna lie, the base code is a lil messy, so if theres any general features that you think needs to be in there just let me know and I can implement it. 
2018-02-19 22:04:46	Jesse	as for the UI, I'm making it so you guys just pass in a set of piles. and the index in the set of piles will determine which pile is positioned where. 
2018-02-19 22:05:46	Jesse	I also hardcoded the height of the board since we know that there will be no higher stack of cards than 13 (which is Ace-King) in solitaire 
2018-02-19 22:07:38	ajshryoc	That would be pretty sweet if we just have to pass in the piles. I think it looks pretty good. We can worry about code cleanup later too. 
2018-02-19 22:09:08	ajshryoc	I was able to get crazy eights working with just 1 player playing cards on the pile, so it looks like we're in a pretty good spot for this project 
2018-02-19 22:09:23	Jesse	dang really? thats pretty awesome 
2018-02-19 22:10:43	ajshryoc	It'll be a cool project once it's all working. The way we have it setup (with your cards.py objects) made it pretty straightforward to program 
2018-02-19 22:10:45	Jesse	can you tell me what the board would look like for crazy eight? is it just a pile for taking cards and a pile for laying cards? also displaying the hand to the player? 
2018-02-19 22:13:53	ajshryoc	@ajshryoc uploaded a file: https://plm18.slack.com/files/U8M1VEVT3/F9ATPNWBS/crazyeights.jpg (crazyeights.JPG) and commented: Here's what I've been using as a sort of debug UI.  So, there's the pile for taking cards, pile for playing cards, and the player's hand. I'm unsure how to handle the computer players since the number of card they hold is definitely relevant to the player. 
2018-02-19 22:14:54	ajshryoc	I think just listing the AI players and showing how many face down cards are in their hands on different lines would be good enough 
2018-02-19 22:16:20	ajshryoc	As a side note, I defined a Move as a Crazy Eights specific object (although it might be worth pulling out) that is defined by a Card, a "to" Pile, and a "from" Pile. It has a method called "make" that will remove the Card from "from" Pile and add it to "to" Pile. This kinda thing might be useful for solitaire too  (edited)
2018-02-19 22:17:59	Jesse	oh. I made a similar function in my Pile class (giveOneCard) 
2018-02-19 22:19:01	ajshryoc	No problem, that totally works. I'll adjust what I've got to match your code once I pull it in 
2018-02-19 22:19:20	Jesse	Would you guys be willing to meet up tomorrow so that we can clean up our code? / continue developing? 
2018-02-19 22:19:32	Jesse	I'm good all day except class time 
2018-02-19 22:20:10	ajshryoc	I'm good from around 1:30 to class time 
2018-02-19 22:24:03	Jesse	okay. I'd be down to meet then.

2018-02-20 07:46:29	jwstanl3	Would you guys be able to meet after class? I have a class from 1:30-2:45 and then I tutor from 3-4 
2018-02-20 10:30:28	Jesse	Yeah. Would you be able to meet after class andrew? I don't think we need a lot of time. My plan was just to use an hour or two to clean up some of the code in the generic game structure/UI's and implement any functionality you guys think would be good for both games. 
2018-02-20 10:32:21	Jesse	If not, I could meet with andrew an hour before class and then after class with Joseph for an hour. 
2018-02-20 11:36:11	ajshryoc	I could meet briefly right after class 
2018-02-20 11:36:34	Jesse	cool! 
2018-02-20 12:00:47	jwstanl3	I have the solitaire game pretty much working completely, but I changed some things in the cards and SolitaireUI files, so I'll wait until we meet to commit anything 
2018-02-20 12:03:24	jwstanl3	@jwstanl3 uploaded a file: https://plm18.slack.com/files/U8N1B358V/F9B8MRFL0/solitaire.gif (Solitaire GIF) and commented: Here's a GIF of the game.  The only thing I haven't implemented is win and loss states. 
2018-02-20 13:05:32	Jesse	thats awesome!! but arent the red cards supposed to go on black cards and vice versa? 
2018-02-20 13:05:45	Jesse	its okay if we want to change it for the sake of project scope 
2018-02-20 13:05:53	Jesse	to be red on red 
2018-02-20 13:08:42	jwstanl3	The rules from Bicycle didn't have any restrictions on color. It just had to be consecutive. But, yea, normally you would alternate colors, and it would be pretty easy to switch the program to follow that. 
2018-02-20 13:09:15	jwstanl3	The game's really easy at the moment, so adding something like that would help it be more challenging.

2018-02-21 20:28:57	jwstanl3	I pushed some fixes to my solitaire code. Cards have to alternate in color now in the stacks. There were a few other bugs I fixed. I still haven't added a win state, or a loss state really, but it should be able to detect a win or loss, if the loss state doesn't have any moves left. I haven't been able to beat the game since adding the alternating colors, so I'm not sure if this is true or not.

2018-02-22 22:08:38	ajshryoc	Added what I have for crazy eights. I think the only major feature missing is the suit change when playing an 8. I also intend to clean up the code and little bit to get rid of redundancy.  (edited)
2018-02-22 22:12:02	Jesse	great!! I'll probably take a look some time this weekend

2018-02-24 12:28:32	Jesse	Do you guys understand python decorators? I haven't been able to reproduce a function that demonstrates the difference with/without the decorator. 
2018-02-25 20:28:31	ajshryoc	Sorry, intended to respond, then totally forgot about this. My understanding of python decorators is it's just another form of syntax for calling functions; however, it sort of ties two functions together and modifies the function being decorated. Here's an article I found that gives a good explanation on the subject: http://python-3-patterns-idioms-test.readthedocs.io/en/latest/PythonDecorators.html

2018-02-25 22:39:22	ajshryoc	Just pushed the finished version of Crazy Eights. It's kinda a mess, so I'll probably do some refactoring of it at some point. I also modified cards.py to print out the unicode symbol corresponding to the card's suit. I was curious about how to do it and it turned out to be really easy, so I added it. I think it makes it much easier to see the cards 
2018-02-25 22:41:04	Jesse	oh nice!!! let me know if theres anything youd like me to change.  
2018-02-26 13:50:38	Jesse	I played both crazy eights and solitaire and I haven't noticed any bugs. winning looks good as well. 
2018-02-26 13:52:31	Jesse	we may be able to polish a few things up but honestly, it doesn't matter too much because we'll be taking parts of our code out and re implementing stuff for the second submission. I think what we have is gold. If there's anything you guys want me to change, just let me know. 
2018-02-26 17:12:29	ajshryoc	Glad you liked it! I think they both play pretty well 
2018-03-12 13:07:36	Jesse	Hey guys, we need to figure out what we need to submit and submit it before class tomorrow. 
2018-03-12 13:11:03	Jesse	Do you guys have the transcript of the 2 games? if not I can make them. 
2018-03-12 13:12:50	ajshryoc	I don't have a transcript. You should be able to use the tee command to output to a file and stdout 
2018-03-12 13:13:04	Jesse	I was just gonna use script 
2018-03-12 13:13:18	Jesse	it automatically outputs the log to a file

2018-03-16 10:06:54	Jesse	I'm gonna take a look now about what we can do to our project for submission 3. 
2018-03-16 10:13:12	Jesse	Nobody but me used cardsTest.py right? would you guys mind if I deleted that file? 
2018-03-16 10:17:46	Jesse	We may want to ask the professor about this... I worry our games are too different. 
2018-03-17 00:11:58	ajshryoc	You can delete cardsTest.py if no one is using it. I would probably make a new directory in the git repo called 'project3' or something so that we have a record of both of our submissions. As for the issues with the games, if you want to ask him, go ahead. I think we could make it work but I'm sure he could provide some insight. <--- Sorry typed this up about 14 hours ago and never hit send 
2018-03-19 14:19:24	Jesse	We got a 90% it seems on what we submitted for the project. He said he liked our nouns/verbs but was disappointed that we didn't make an FSM. He also linked "Derive Interfaces from Constraints of Data" as if its some reading on moodle or github. 
2018-03-19 14:19:57	Jesse	... I checked both, and I'm not sure what he's talking about 
2018-03-19 14:36:38	ajshryoc	I'm also unsure what he meant by that. Our design did get a shoutout in #proj2_mar1 though so that's pretty cool 
2018-03-19 14:38:04	Jesse	i didn't see that. that is pretty cool 
2018-03-19 14:38:44	ajshryoc	Also, just realized the section the he references is also in that Google doc with the feedback 
2018-03-19 15:03:59	jwstanl3	Even after looking at that section, I'm still not sure what he wants us to get from that. The lines he references are where the suits are printed in Crazy Eights to allow the user to select which suit to change to. I don't get how that could be changed. 
2018-03-19 16:30:23	ajshryoc	It could definitely be made better. I think the whole system, crazy eights especially, could benefit from state machines. I intended to cleanup some of that code, but I decided to just wait until this upcoming submission. I'll take a better look at the comments later 
2018-03-19 17:59:01	Jesse	I'm not sure I know how the system could be improved with FSMs. But if you know what you'd like to change, I could definitely help out with that. The issue I see with FSMs is that only crazy eights would use it... and it would just be wasted code for solitaire. 
2018-03-19 19:10:58	ajshryoc	I'm sure he'll provide more context tomorrow. I'll review their comments too and we can go from there 
2018-03-20 10:11:37	Jesse	Hey guys, I was checking out a few other peoples code, and i found one where they built the FSM setup stuff, and didn't call it anywhere in their code xD. I wonder if the graders caught it.

2018-01-23 17:45:08	Jesse	Hello 
2018-01-27 17:50:56	Jesse	we should probably figure out what 2 card games we are going to choose. 
2018-01-27 17:52:53	Jesse	so one has to be some variant of a game which I forgot the name to.. and the other could be anything that involves the standard 52 deck of cards. 
2018-01-27 17:58:05	Jesse	I'm thinking solitaire or some variant of it would be pretty easy to program. 
2018-01-27 18:00:03	Jesse	it wouldnt be as easy as something like blackjack or go fish but those ones are already taken. 
2018-01-27 20:53:36	ajshryoc	I'm cool with solitaire. The game you forgot the name to is Bartok. A Bartok variant I would suggest we annotate would be Crazy Eights. 
2018-01-27 20:54:10	Jesse	im not familiar with either of the two games 
2018-01-27 20:54:36	ajshryoc	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crazy_Eights
2018-01-27 20:54:36		Wikipedia: Crazy Eights
2018-01-27 20:54:36		Crazy Eights is a shedding-type card game for two to seven players. The object of the game is to be the first to get rid of all the player's cards to a discard pile. The game is considered a pre-extension of Switch and Mau Mau.
2018-01-27 20:54:36		A standard 52-card deck is used when there are five or fewer players. When there are more than five players, two decks are shuffled together and all 104 cards are used. 
2018-01-27 20:54:59	ajshryoc	Not familiar with solitaire? Or Bartok? 
2018-01-27 22:25:26	Jesse	bartok and crazy eight. 
2018-01-28 20:18:47	ajshryoc	Bartok is just the game where you have a hand and have to play cards that match a card with the same suit/rank until you run out of cards. Crazy Eights is just that with a couple of other additions, if I remember 
2018-01-28 20:33:54	Jesse	gotcha. well it may make it difficult if we choose a game vastly different from that, so idk if solitaire is a good idea... but I'm sure we could do it if we cant find a better game. 
2018-01-28 20:54:33	ajshryoc	I mean, technically our language should be able to create any kind of game so having two very different games to base it off of might actually be beneficial, although a little more work for the annotation. 
2018-01-28 20:55:28	Jesse	should we call dibs on solitaire then in the proj1 channel? 
2018-01-28 20:57:45	ajshryoc	I'm cool with that 
2018-01-28 21:11:35	ajshryoc	Do we have to claim both games? Or just the non-Bartok clone one? 
2018-01-28 21:12:15	Jesse	i guess juat the non-bartok 
2018-01-28 21:12:27	Jesse	just* 
2018-01-29 17:21:22	Jesse	When can you guys meet up to work on the card game annotations? 
2018-01-29 17:22:08	Jesse	I'm free up until 4:30 on thursday. 
2018-01-29 17:22:23	Jesse	or any time on friday

2018-01-29 17:50:03	Jesse	id be willing to meet up on friday. what about you andrew? 
2018-01-29 17:53:51	ajshryoc	I've got senior design 10:40-12:30 on friday and I typically work afterwards. I could meet before class if that is an option for you guys? Another suggestion would be after class Thursday 
2018-01-29 17:54:37	jwstanl3	I can meet after class Thursday 
2018-01-29 17:54:48	Jesse	Yeah I can do that 
2018-01-29 17:55:25	ajshryoc	Alright, cool 
2018-02-01 20:59:14	Jesse	hey guys, I put in a little bit at the end of the card game annotations. please check if theres anything you'd like to add or modify. 
2018-02-01 21:35:25	ajshryoc	That part looks good and I think was a smart addition 
2018-02-01 21:35:41	Jesse	thank you 
2018-02-01 21:37:41	ajshryoc	I will probably go back to this throughout the weekend if I think of more similarities/differences to add. Overall though, I think it looks good. I probably won't be able to put in a good chunk of time on this assignment until Monday, but I don't think it'll take that long to write out what we already have. 
2018-02-01 21:38:41	Jesse	when you mean write out, do you mean hand-written? 
2018-02-01 21:39:15	ajshryoc	Sorry, I mean like write out in a sentence rather than just a list 
2018-02-01 21:40:00	Jesse	Ahh.. I'm not too sure its important to have it in sentence form, but if you think that would be better, go for it xD 
2018-02-01 21:40:48	Jesse	i can of course help too.. just want to be sure thats something you think is important 
2018-02-01 21:42:56	ajshryoc	I suppose he doesn't really say what format it should be in and only says "list what is similar, what is different", so I'm not entirely sure what he's looking for. I think as long as it's clear we can have it in list form, maybe just with an intro paragraph for each section. 
2018-02-01 21:45:00	Jesse	I don't think he knows what he is looking for lol. And I'm not too sure what I would put in an intro paragraph. 
2018-02-01 23:04:13	ajshryoc	Yeah, good point. We can see how it is and how much time we want to put in next week. 
2018-02-05 21:28:33	ajshryoc	I'm working on the annotations a litte. Just trying to add some more words to the game descriptions. Let me know what you guys think and feel free to add anything 
2018-02-06 19:31:23	ajshryoc	I made a couple small additions to the annotation. Mainly just for formatting/flow. Let me know what you guys think and add whatever else you think we need. If you guys think it's good, I can submit the doc 
2018-02-06 20:39:28	Jesse	ill take a look now. sorry i was distracted 
2018-02-06 20:44:36	Jesse	well dang. thats a lot more of an improvement than i was expecting. Nice work Andrew  
2018-02-06 20:45:22	jwstanl3	Everything looks good 
2018-02-06 20:47:21	Jesse	yeah I agree. 
2018-02-06 20:48:54	Jesse	would you like me to submit? 
2018-02-06 20:49:09	ajshryoc	Thanks, just took what we had before and made it flow a little better  
2018-02-06 20:49:18	ajshryoc	Yeah, go ahead and submit if you want 
2018-02-06 20:50:39	Jesse	done 
2018-02-06 20:50:49	ajshryoc	Sweet 
2018-02-11 09:22:16	Jesse	Hey guys do either of you understand the homework? 
2018-02-11 11:38:18	ajshryoc	I have not taken a look at it so far. I just saw that Alex Phelps posted some tips in #homework that seemed helpful. Will probably get to the homework later today or tomorrow 
2018-02-11 11:49:28	Jesse	yeah. i gotcha 
2018-02-12 21:17:50	ajshryoc	Have you guys finished the homework? I think I've got it---it looks like it's behaving correctly, but I'm not sure what he wants exactly 
2018-02-13 10:43:30	Jesse	I submitted something but I don't think it's right at all. I just made the program look like it was doing something right and submittted it. 
2018-02-13 14:46:06	Jesse	I just pushed  a starter to our cardgame project in our github repo. check it out when ya get the chance. i was just sketching some things up so feel free to modify whatever. 
2018-02-13 15:46:25	ajshryoc	Okay, I'll check it out 
2018-02-14 21:35:45	ajshryoc	@ajshryoc shared a file: https://plm18.slack.com/files/U8M1VEVT3/F98NZUTNC/CSC495_Project_Todo_List (CSC495 Project Todo List) 
2018-02-14 21:35:45		@ajshryoc commented on @ajshryoc?s file https://plm18.slack.com/files/U8M1VEVT3/F98NZUTNC/CSC495_Project_Todo_List (CSC495 Project Todo List): Hey guys, I did a little design work on an approach I've thought of for implementing the two games based on some stuff we've talked about in class. I mainly just tried to break down the game object that were suggested we use in class in the context of a finite state machine. Let me know what you think and if you have suggestions/feedback. We could then write this up as GitHub issues. That way, we can assign things as tasks. 
2018-02-14 21:42:45	Jesse	thats a pretty solid writeup. I'll spend some more time looking over it later.  I think the most complex thing is going to be implementing rules and goals since they can vary  a lot from game to game. 
2018-02-14 21:44:58	ajshryoc	I agree. That along with what constitutes a valid move---especially with solitaire. 
2018-02-15 14:40:27	Jesse	hey guys, i'm gonna be late to class today. I've got a video call with the people i'll be interning with from 3:30 to 4:30. 
2018-02-16 00:07:50	ajshryoc	added an integration to this channel: https://plm18.slack.com/services/B9A0YJ9V1 (github) 
2018-02-16 00:12:00	ajshryoc	I've converted the list I wrote up yesterday into a few GitHub issues. Please feel free to take a look and modify if you see fit. With these we can more easily divide up tasks (or subtasks) and tag commits/branches with them. I also added the GitHub app to this channel, which will post when events happen on the repo. If it starts to get annoying, I can reduce the notifications or turn it off. Figured I'd give it a shot and see if it's useful for keeping everyone up to date on code changes 
2018-02-16 10:06:31	Jesse	I'll start working on this tomorrow. I'm dedicating today to English 331 and research. thanks for this Andrew. [:+1:1] 
2018-02-17 12:56:28	Jesse	I'm gonna be working on this project starting now. I'll try to document my work here. I'm willing to meet up at Hunt if you guys are interested, but it's not necessary. 
2018-02-17 13:04:31	ajshryoc	Sweet. I may work on this depending on how quickly I can do my networks homework today.  
2018-02-17 13:07:13	Jesse	Ok. I'm gonna be looking more into higher level design aspects rather than implementation. I'll let you know what I find. [:+1:1] 
2018-02-17 14:19:00	Jesse	I think I've worked out most of the ambiguous stuff. i can try to upload my notes but it is quite illegible, so ill have to meet with you guys some time to explain.
2018-02-17 14:19:00		Once I work out the rest of the thinking stuff, Ill try to lay out what needs to be done in the form of  a informal UML diagram. From there, I'm going to give out some tasks as far as implementation of this UML. 
2018-02-17 14:19:00		this is my goal for today.

2018-02-17 17:47:09	Jesse	Hey guys, I pushed my UML diagram. Tomorrow I'll handle some of the basic classes like hand, pile, deck and whatever. I also assigned myself to the UI task. 
2018-02-17 17:47:30	ajshryoc	Hey @jwstanl3, which one of the two games would you like to work on? 
2018-02-17 20:14:45	jwstanl3	I'll look into Solitaire. Sorry for taking so long to reply.

2018-02-19 10:14:55	Jesse	I dont think I updated you guys on what I did in that commit. I implemented the basic structure and started on the solitaire UI. I left the rulebook and other game specific things unimplemented. I would also like to expand the basic structures functionality to things like flipping over a card or moving sets of cards from one pile to another pile. 
2018-02-19 17:12:34	ajshryoc	Yeah, added functionality like that would be great. I'm not sure how difficult it would be, but it would be cool if the Pile class was iterable so that you could use it in a for loop. If it too complicated to add that don't worry about it

2018-02-19 21:24:57	Jesse	I added functionality for piles giving one card or giving a set of cards. [:+1:1]

2018-02-19 21:56:00	Jesse	the UI for solitaire is starting to look good. 
2018-02-19 21:56:28	ajshryoc	Yeah, nice! 
2018-02-19 22:03:59	Jesse	I'm not gonna lie, the base code is a lil messy, so if theres any general features that you think needs to be in there just let me know and I can implement it. 
2018-02-19 22:04:46	Jesse	as for the UI, I'm making it so you guys just pass in a set of piles. and the index in the set of piles will determine which pile is positioned where. 
2018-02-19 22:05:46	Jesse	I also hardcoded the height of the board since we know that there will be no higher stack of cards than 13 (which is Ace-King) in solitaire 
2018-02-19 22:07:38	ajshryoc	That would be pretty sweet if we just have to pass in the piles. I think it looks pretty good. We can worry about code cleanup later too. 
2018-02-19 22:09:08	ajshryoc	I was able to get crazy eights working with just 1 player playing cards on the pile, so it looks like we're in a pretty good spot for this project 
2018-02-19 22:09:23	Jesse	dang really? thats pretty awesome 
2018-02-19 22:10:43	ajshryoc	It'll be a cool project once it's all working. The way we have it setup (with your cards.py objects) made it pretty straightforward to program 
2018-02-19 22:10:45	Jesse	can you tell me what the board would look like for crazy eight? is it just a pile for taking cards and a pile for laying cards? also displaying the hand to the player? 
2018-02-19 22:13:53	ajshryoc	@ajshryoc uploaded a file: https://plm18.slack.com/files/U8M1VEVT3/F9ATPNWBS/crazyeights.jpg (crazyeights.JPG) and commented: Here's what I've been using as a sort of debug UI.  So, there's the pile for taking cards, pile for playing cards, and the player's hand. I'm unsure how to handle the computer players since the number of card they hold is definitely relevant to the player. 
2018-02-19 22:14:54	ajshryoc	I think just listing the AI players and showing how many face down cards are in their hands on different lines would be good enough 
2018-02-19 22:16:20	ajshryoc	As a side note, I defined a Move as a Crazy Eights specific object (although it might be worth pulling out) that is defined by a Card, a "to" Pile, and a "from" Pile. It has a method called "make" that will remove the Card from "from" Pile and add it to "to" Pile. This kinda thing might be useful for solitaire too  (edited)
2018-02-19 22:17:59	Jesse	oh. I made a similar function in my Pile class (giveOneCard) 
2018-02-19 22:19:01	ajshryoc	No problem, that totally works. I'll adjust what I've got to match your code once I pull it in 
2018-02-19 22:19:20	Jesse	Would you guys be willing to meet up tomorrow so that we can clean up our code? / continue developing? 
2018-02-19 22:19:32	Jesse	I'm good all day except class time 
2018-02-19 22:20:10	ajshryoc	I'm good from around 1:30 to class time

2018-02-20 10:30:28	Jesse	Yeah. Would you be able to meet after class andrew? I don't think we need a lot of time. My plan was just to use an hour or two to clean up some of the code in the generic game structure/UI's and implement any functionality you guys think would be good for both games. 
2018-02-20 10:32:21	Jesse	If not, I could meet with andrew an hour before class and then after class with Joseph for an hour.

2018-02-20 12:00:47	jwstanl3	I have the solitaire game pretty much working completely, but I changed some things in the cards and SolitaireUI files, so I'll wait until we meet to commit anything

2018-02-20 13:05:32	Jesse	thats awesome!! but arent the red cards supposed to go on black cards and vice versa? 
2018-02-20 13:05:45	Jesse	its okay if we want to change it for the sake of project scope 
2018-02-20 13:05:53	Jesse	to be red on red 
2018-02-20 13:08:42	jwstanl3	The rules from Bicycle didn't have any restrictions on color. It just had to be consecutive. But, yea, normally you would alternate colors, and it would be pretty easy to switch the program to follow that. 
2018-02-20 13:09:15	jwstanl3	The game's really easy at the moment, so adding something like that would help it be more challenging.

2018-02-21 20:28:57	jwstanl3	I pushed some fixes to my solitaire code. Cards have to alternate in color now in the stacks. There were a few other bugs I fixed. I still haven't added a win state, or a loss state really, but it should be able to detect a win or loss, if the loss state doesn't have any moves left. I haven't been able to beat the game since adding the alternating colors, so I'm not sure if this is true or not.

2018-02-22 22:08:38	ajshryoc	Added what I have for crazy eights. I think the only major feature missing is the suit change when playing an 8. I also intend to clean up the code and little bit to get rid of redundancy.  (edited)

2018-02-24 12:28:32	Jesse	Do you guys understand python decorators? I haven't been able to reproduce a function that demonstrates the difference with/without the decorator. 
2018-02-25 20:28:31	ajshryoc	Sorry, intended to respond, then totally forgot about this. My understanding of python decorators is it's just another form of syntax for calling functions; however, it sort of ties two functions together and modifies the function being decorated. Here's an article I found that gives a good explanation on the subject: http://python-3-patterns-idioms-test.readthedocs.io/en/latest/PythonDecorators.html

2018-02-25 22:39:22	ajshryoc	Just pushed the finished version of Crazy Eights. It's kinda a mess, so I'll probably do some refactoring of it at some point. I also modified cards.py to print out the unicode symbol corresponding to the card's suit. I was curious about how to do it and it turned out to be really easy, so I added it. I think it makes it much easier to see the cards 
2018-02-25 22:41:04	Jesse	oh nice!!! let me know if theres anything youd like me to change.  
2018-02-26 13:50:38	Jesse	I played both crazy eights and solitaire and I haven't noticed any bugs. winning looks good as well. 
2018-02-26 13:52:31	Jesse	we may be able to polish a few things up but honestly, it doesn't matter too much because we'll be taking parts of our code out and re implementing stuff for the second submission. I think what we have is gold. If there's anything you guys want me to change, just let me know. 
2018-02-26 17:12:29	ajshryoc	Glad you liked it! I think they both play pretty well 
2018-03-12 13:07:36	Jesse	Hey guys, we need to figure out what we need to submit and submit it before class tomorrow. 
2018-03-12 13:11:03	Jesse	Do you guys have the transcript of the 2 games? if not I can make them. 
2018-03-12 13:12:50	ajshryoc	I don't have a transcript. You should be able to use the tee command to output to a file and stdout 
2018-03-12 13:13:04	Jesse	I was just gonna use script 
2018-03-12 13:13:18	Jesse	it automatically outputs the log to a file 
2018-03-12 13:13:31	ajshryoc	Yeah, whatever works 
2018-03-12 13:13:53	Jesse	alright. 
2018-03-12 13:24:42	ajshryoc	Thanks 
2018-03-12 13:29:54	Jesse	I've got the two for crazy eights done. solitaire will take some more time [:+1:1]

2018-03-12 14:41:24	Jesse	Alright, the transcripts are made. Can someone else do the work of submitting and making a cheap readme with some basic information like linking to the transcript file and how to run each of the games? 
2018-03-12 14:42:00	Jesse	that solitaire is makin my eyes hurt haha.

2018-03-16 10:06:54	Jesse	I'm gonna take a look now about what we can do to our project for submission 3. 
2018-03-16 10:13:12	Jesse	Nobody but me used cardsTest.py right? would you guys mind if I deleted that file? 
2018-03-16 10:17:46	Jesse	We may want to ask the professor about this... I worry our games are too different. 
2018-03-17 00:11:58	ajshryoc	You can delete cardsTest.py if no one is using it. I would probably make a new directory in the git repo called 'project3' or something so that we have a record of both of our submissions. As for the issues with the games, if you want to ask him, go ahead. I think we could make it work but I'm sure he could provide some insight. <--- Sorry typed this up about 14 hours ago and never hit send 
2018-03-19 14:19:24	Jesse	We got a 90% it seems on what we submitted for the project. He said he liked our nouns/verbs but was disappointed that we didn't make an FSM. He also linked "Derive Interfaces from Constraints of Data" as if its some reading on moodle or github. 
2018-03-19 14:19:57	Jesse	... I checked both, and I'm not sure what he's talking about 
2018-03-19 14:36:38	ajshryoc	I'm also unsure what he meant by that. Our design did get a shoutout in #proj2_mar1 though so that's pretty cool 
2018-03-19 14:38:04	Jesse	i didn't see that. that is pretty cool 
2018-03-19 14:38:44	ajshryoc	Also, just realized the section the he references is also in that Google doc with the feedback 
2018-03-19 15:03:59	jwstanl3	Even after looking at that section, I'm still not sure what he wants us to get from that. The lines he references are where the suits are printed in Crazy Eights to allow the user to select which suit to change to. I don't get how that could be changed. 
2018-03-19 16:30:23	ajshryoc	It could definitely be made better. I think the whole system, crazy eights especially, could benefit from state machines. I intended to cleanup some of that code, but I decided to just wait until this upcoming submission. I'll take a better look at the comments later 
2018-03-19 17:59:01	Jesse	I'm not sure I know how the system could be improved with FSMs. But if you know what you'd like to change, I could definitely help out with that. The issue I see with FSMs is that only crazy eights would use it... and it would just be wasted code for solitaire. 
2018-03-19 19:10:58	ajshryoc	I'm sure he'll provide more context tomorrow. I'll review their comments too and we can go from there 
2018-03-20 10:11:37	Jesse	Hey guys, I was checking out a few other peoples code, and i found one where they built the FSM setup stuff, and didn't call it anywhere in their code xD. I wonder if the graders caught it.

2018-03-28 20:46:28	Jesse	I get what you mean, and I tried coding that up last night, but I'm struggling with what should be classes vs methods vs variables, and how should all of these things be linked up together?   
2018-03-28 20:49:16	Jesse	I guess the obvious answer would be to have all states and transitions be their own classes... but it also doesn't make sense for them to be their own classes when they might only have one variable or one method... and if the method just says pass, it doesn't really make sense to even have that method... 
2018-03-28 20:50:07	Jesse	And so you take the approach of having strings be states and methods being transitions... which is exactly how our code is now.. 
2018-03-28 20:50:32	Jesse	That's where my confusion with this project is. 
2018-03-28 20:52:56	ajshryoc	Yes, you're right and I'm not 100% sure how this implementation would work either. But, a lot of that I think could be solved by how it's implemented. For example, the State class could have a default implementation of each of its methods that is just "pass", that way, if you don't need the method, you don't worry about it. 
2018-03-28 20:55:40	ajshryoc	I think that Start, Play, Goal, and Fail could each be subclasses of State. When, as an example, Crazy Eights goes to instantiate a Start state, it should just have to pass in a lambda body that sets up the game. So, it wouldn't even need to subclass a new Start state (although it could). I think that it would look something like this: 
2018-03-28 20:55:45	ajshryoc	`start = new StartState(onEntry=setupCrazyEights)` 
2018-03-28 20:56:46	ajshryoc	`game.fsm = new FSM(start=start, play=runGame, end=endGame)` 
2018-03-28 20:57:07	ajshryoc	Or something like that. I may be oversimplifying things but I think it's doable 
2018-03-28 21:01:18	Jesse	I'll give it another shot tonight and let you know how it ends up tomorrow 
2018-03-28 21:02:43	ajshryoc	Okay, I will take a look at it too 
2018-03-28 21:24:44	Jesse	@Jesse uploaded a file: https://plm18.slack.com/files/U8N7VJU30/F9Z06TD0X/fsm.py (fsm) 
2018-03-28 21:24:51	Jesse	does that look like a good start? 
2018-03-28 21:32:03	Jesse	I really like the idea of passing in lambda bodies to abstract functions... that solved some of my 'why' questions earlier.. but its still kinda confusin  
2018-03-28 21:32:17	ajshryoc	Yeah, I think so. For the lambdas you pass in, you should just be able to pass in a function that performs the 'move 
2018-03-28 21:32:36	ajshryoc	But, yeah I agree it is a little confusing 
2018-03-28 21:59:24	Jesse	nevermind, this whole thing seems stupid again... its like we're just making 4 methods for the sake of calling the same methods we would have initially. We pass the functions into some abstract class which just calls those methods in the abstract class... why not just call the functions? 
2018-03-28 22:04:45	Jesse	This whole process isn't saving us any lines of code... and as far as run-time and memory goes, this is more inefficient than what we've coded. It's even more unreadable too since theres more files for future programmers to go through. 
2018-03-30 19:32:58		getting channel history...
2018-01-27 20:54:59	ajshryoc	Not familiar with solitaire? Or Bartok? 
2018-01-27 22:25:26	Jesse	bartok and crazy eight. 
2018-01-28 20:18:47	ajshryoc	Bartok is just the game where you have a hand and have to play cards that match a card with the same suit/rank until you run out of cards. Crazy Eights is just that with a couple of other additions, if I remember 
2018-01-28 20:33:54	Jesse	gotcha. well it may make it difficult if we choose a game vastly different from that, so idk if solitaire is a good idea... but I'm sure we could do it if we cant find a better game. 
2018-01-28 20:54:33	ajshryoc	I mean, technically our language should be able to create any kind of game so having two very different games to base it off of might actually be beneficial, although a little more work for the annotation. 
2018-01-28 20:55:28	Jesse	should we call dibs on solitaire then in the proj1 channel? 
2018-01-28 20:57:45	ajshryoc	I'm cool with that 
2018-01-28 21:11:35	ajshryoc	Do we have to claim both games? Or just the non-Bartok clone one? 
2018-01-28 21:12:15	Jesse	i guess juat the non-bartok 
2018-01-28 21:12:27	Jesse	just* 
2018-01-29 17:21:22	Jesse	When can you guys meet up to work on the card game annotations? 
2018-01-29 17:22:08	Jesse	I'm free up until 4:30 on thursday. 
2018-01-29 17:22:23	Jesse	or any time on friday 
2018-01-29 17:30:09	ajshryoc	Between 2 and 4:30 on Thursday works for me 
2018-01-29 17:33:21	Jesse	sounds good to me.

2018-01-29 17:50:03	Jesse	id be willing to meet up on friday. what about you andrew? 
2018-01-29 17:53:51	ajshryoc	I've got senior design 10:40-12:30 on friday and I typically work afterwards. I could meet before class if that is an option for you guys? Another suggestion would be after class Thursday 
2018-01-29 17:54:37	jwstanl3	I can meet after class Thursday 
2018-01-29 17:54:48	Jesse	Yeah I can do that 
2018-01-29 17:55:25	ajshryoc	Alright, cool 
2018-02-01 20:59:14	Jesse	hey guys, I put in a little bit at the end of the card game annotations. please check if theres anything you'd like to add or modify. 
2018-02-01 21:35:25	ajshryoc	That part looks good and I think was a smart addition 
2018-02-01 21:35:41	Jesse	thank you 
2018-02-01 21:37:41	ajshryoc	I will probably go back to this throughout the weekend if I think of more similarities/differences to add. Overall though, I think it looks good. I probably won't be able to put in a good chunk of time on this assignment until Monday, but I don't think it'll take that long to write out what we already have. 
2018-02-01 21:38:41	Jesse	when you mean write out, do you mean hand-written? 
2018-02-01 21:39:15	ajshryoc	Sorry, I mean like write out in a sentence rather than just a list 
2018-02-01 21:40:00	Jesse	Ahh.. I'm not too sure its important to have it in sentence form, but if you think that would be better, go for it xD 
2018-02-01 21:40:48	Jesse	i can of course help too.. just want to be sure thats something you think is important 
2018-02-01 21:42:56	ajshryoc	I suppose he doesn't really say what format it should be in and only says "list what is similar, what is different", so I'm not entirely sure what he's looking for. I think as long as it's clear we can have it in list form, maybe just with an intro paragraph for each section. 
2018-02-01 21:45:00	Jesse	I don't think he knows what he is looking for lol. And I'm not too sure what I would put in an intro paragraph. 
2018-02-01 23:04:13	ajshryoc	Yeah, good point. We can see how it is and how much time we want to put in next week. 
2018-02-05 21:28:33	ajshryoc	I'm working on the annotations a litte. Just trying to add some more words to the game descriptions. Let me know what you guys think and feel free to add anything 
2018-02-06 19:31:23	ajshryoc	I made a couple small additions to the annotation. Mainly just for formatting/flow. Let me know what you guys think and add whatever else you think we need. If you guys think it's good, I can submit the doc 
2018-02-06 20:39:28	Jesse	ill take a look now. sorry i was distracted 
2018-02-06 20:44:36	Jesse	well dang. thats a lot more of an improvement than i was expecting. Nice work Andrew  
2018-02-06 20:45:22	jwstanl3	Everything looks good 
2018-02-06 20:47:21	Jesse	yeah I agree. 
2018-02-06 20:48:54	Jesse	would you like me to submit? 
2018-02-06 20:49:09	ajshryoc	Thanks, just took what we had before and made it flow a little better  
2018-02-06 20:49:18	ajshryoc	Yeah, go ahead and submit if you want 
2018-02-06 20:50:39	Jesse	done 
2018-02-06 20:50:49	ajshryoc	Sweet 
2018-02-11 09:22:16	Jesse	Hey guys do either of you understand the homework? 
2018-02-11 11:38:18	ajshryoc	I have not taken a look at it so far. I just saw that Alex Phelps posted some tips in #homework that seemed helpful. Will probably get to the homework later today or tomorrow 
2018-02-11 11:49:28	Jesse	yeah. i gotcha 
2018-02-12 21:17:50	ajshryoc	Have you guys finished the homework? I think I've got it---it looks like it's behaving correctly, but I'm not sure what he wants exactly 
2018-02-13 10:43:30	Jesse	I submitted something but I don't think it's right at all. I just made the program look like it was doing something right and submittted it. 
2018-02-13 14:46:06	Jesse	I just pushed  a starter to our cardgame project in our github repo. check it out when ya get the chance. i was just sketching some things up so feel free to modify whatever. 
2018-02-13 15:46:25	ajshryoc	Okay, I'll check it out

2018-02-14 21:35:45		@ajshryoc commented on @ajshryoc?s file https://plm18.slack.com/files/U8M1VEVT3/F98NZUTNC/CSC495_Project_Todo_List (CSC495 Project Todo List): Hey guys, I did a little design work on an approach I've thought of for implementing the two games based on some stuff we've talked about in class. I mainly just tried to break down the game object that were suggested we use in class in the context of a finite state machine. Let me know what you think and if you have suggestions/feedback. We could then write this up as GitHub issues. That way, we can assign things as tasks. 
2018-02-14 21:42:45	Jesse	thats a pretty solid writeup. I'll spend some more time looking over it later.  I think the most complex thing is going to be implementing rules and goals since they can vary  a lot from game to game. 
2018-02-14 21:44:58	ajshryoc	I agree. That along with what constitutes a valid move---especially with solitaire. 
2018-02-15 14:40:27	Jesse	hey guys, i'm gonna be late to class today. I've got a video call with the people i'll be interning with from 3:30 to 4:30. 
2018-02-16 00:07:50	ajshryoc	added an integration to this channel: https://plm18.slack.com/services/B9A0YJ9V1 (github) 
2018-02-16 00:12:00	ajshryoc	I've converted the list I wrote up yesterday into a few GitHub issues. Please feel free to take a look and modify if you see fit. With these we can more easily divide up tasks (or subtasks) and tag commits/branches with them. I also added the GitHub app to this channel, which will post when events happen on the repo. If it starts to get annoying, I can reduce the notifications or turn it off. Figured I'd give it a shot and see if it's useful for keeping everyone up to date on code changes 
2018-02-16 10:06:31	Jesse	I'll start working on this tomorrow. I'm dedicating today to English 331 and research. thanks for this Andrew. [:+1:1] 
2018-02-17 12:56:28	Jesse	I'm gonna be working on this project starting now. I'll try to document my work here. I'm willing to meet up at Hunt if you guys are interested, but it's not necessary. 
2018-02-17 13:04:31	ajshryoc	Sweet. I may work on this depending on how quickly I can do my networks homework today.  
2018-02-17 13:07:13	Jesse	Ok. I'm gonna be looking more into higher level design aspects rather than implementation. I'll let you know what I find. [:+1:1] 
2018-02-17 14:19:00	Jesse	I think I've worked out most of the ambiguous stuff. i can try to upload my notes but it is quite illegible, so ill have to meet with you guys some time to explain.
2018-02-17 14:19:00		Once I work out the rest of the thinking stuff, Ill try to lay out what needs to be done in the form of  a informal UML diagram. From there, I'm going to give out some tasks as far as implementation of this UML. 
2018-02-17 14:19:00		this is my goal for today.

2018-02-17 17:47:09	Jesse	Hey guys, I pushed my UML diagram. Tomorrow I'll handle some of the basic classes like hand, pile, deck and whatever. I also assigned myself to the UI task. 
2018-02-17 17:47:30	ajshryoc	Hey @jwstanl3, which one of the two games would you like to work on? 
2018-02-17 20:14:45	jwstanl3	I'll look into Solitaire. Sorry for taking so long to reply.

2018-02-19 10:14:55	Jesse	I dont think I updated you guys on what I did in that commit. I implemented the basic structure and started on the solitaire UI. I left the rulebook and other game specific things unimplemented. I would also like to expand the basic structures functionality to things like flipping over a card or moving sets of cards from one pile to another pile. 
2018-02-19 17:12:34	ajshryoc	Yeah, added functionality like that would be great. I'm not sure how difficult it would be, but it would be cool if the Pile class was iterable so that you could use it in a for loop. If it too complicated to add that don't worry about it

2018-02-19 21:24:57	Jesse	I added functionality for piles giving one card or giving a set of cards. [:+1:1]

2018-02-19 21:56:00	Jesse	the UI for solitaire is starting to look good. 
2018-02-19 21:56:28	ajshryoc	Yeah, nice! 
2018-02-19 22:03:59	Jesse	I'm not gonna lie, the base code is a lil messy, so if theres any general features that you think needs to be in there just let me know and I can implement it. 
2018-02-19 22:04:46	Jesse	as for the UI, I'm making it so you guys just pass in a set of piles. and the index in the set of piles will determine which pile is positioned where. 
2018-02-19 22:05:46	Jesse	I also hardcoded the height of the board since we know that there will be no higher stack of cards than 13 (which is Ace-King) in solitaire 
2018-02-19 22:07:38	ajshryoc	That would be pretty sweet if we just have to pass in the piles. I think it looks pretty good. We can worry about code cleanup later too. 
2018-02-19 22:09:08	ajshryoc	I was able to get crazy eights working with just 1 player playing cards on the pile, so it looks like we're in a pretty good spot for this project 
2018-02-19 22:09:23	Jesse	dang really? thats pretty awesome 
2018-02-19 22:10:43	ajshryoc	It'll be a cool project once it's all working. The way we have it setup (with your cards.py objects) made it pretty straightforward to program 
2018-02-19 22:10:45	Jesse	can you tell me what the board would look like for crazy eight? is it just a pile for taking cards and a pile for laying cards? also displaying the hand to the player? 
2018-02-19 22:13:53	ajshryoc	@ajshryoc uploaded a file: https://plm18.slack.com/files/U8M1VEVT3/F9ATPNWBS/crazyeights.jpg (crazyeights.JPG) and commented: Here's what I've been using as a sort of debug UI.  So, there's the pile for taking cards, pile for playing cards, and the player's hand. I'm unsure how to handle the computer players since the number of card they hold is definitely relevant to the player. 
2018-02-19 22:14:54	ajshryoc	I think just listing the AI players and showing how many face down cards are in their hands on different lines would be good enough 
2018-02-19 22:16:20	ajshryoc	As a side note, I defined a Move as a Crazy Eights specific object (although it might be worth pulling out) that is defined by a Card, a "to" Pile, and a "from" Pile. It has a method called "make" that will remove the Card from "from" Pile and add it to "to" Pile. This kinda thing might be useful for solitaire too  (edited)
2018-02-19 22:17:59	Jesse	oh. I made a similar function in my Pile class (giveOneCard) 
2018-02-19 22:19:01	ajshryoc	No problem, that totally works. I'll adjust what I've got to match your code once I pull it in 
2018-02-19 22:19:20	Jesse	Would you guys be willing to meet up tomorrow so that we can clean up our code? / continue developing? 
2018-02-19 22:19:32	Jesse	I'm good all day except class time 
2018-02-19 22:20:10	ajshryoc	I'm good from around 1:30 to class time

2018-02-20 10:30:28	Jesse	Yeah. Would you be able to meet after class andrew? I don't think we need a lot of time. My plan was just to use an hour or two to clean up some of the code in the generic game structure/UI's and implement any functionality you guys think would be good for both games. 
2018-02-20 10:32:21	Jesse	If not, I could meet with andrew an hour before class and then after class with Joseph for an hour.

2018-02-20 13:05:32	Jesse	thats awesome!! but arent the red cards supposed to go on black cards and vice versa? 
2018-02-20 13:05:45	Jesse	its okay if we want to change it for the sake of project scope 
2018-02-20 13:05:53	Jesse	to be red on red 
2018-02-20 13:08:42	jwstanl3	The rules from Bicycle didn't have any restrictions on color. It just had to be consecutive. But, yea, normally you would alternate colors, and it would be pretty easy to switch the program to follow that. 
2018-02-20 13:09:15	jwstanl3	The game's really easy at the moment, so adding something like that would help it be more challenging.

2018-02-21 20:28:57	jwstanl3	I pushed some fixes to my solitaire code. Cards have to alternate in color now in the stacks. There were a few other bugs I fixed. I still haven't added a win state, or a loss state really, but it should be able to detect a win or loss, if the loss state doesn't have any moves left. I haven't been able to beat the game since adding the alternating colors, so I'm not sure if this is true or not.

2018-02-22 22:08:38	ajshryoc	Added what I have for crazy eights. I think the only major feature missing is the suit change when playing an 8. I also intend to clean up the code and little bit to get rid of redundancy.  (edited)

2018-02-25 20:28:31	ajshryoc	Sorry, intended to respond, then totally forgot about this. My understanding of python decorators is it's just another form of syntax for calling functions; however, it sort of ties two functions together and modifies the function being decorated. Here's an article I found that gives a good explanation on the subject: http://python-3-patterns-idioms-test.readthedocs.io/en/latest/PythonDecorators.html

2018-02-25 22:39:22	ajshryoc	Just pushed the finished version of Crazy Eights. It's kinda a mess, so I'll probably do some refactoring of it at some point. I also modified cards.py to print out the unicode symbol corresponding to the card's suit. I was curious about how to do it and it turned out to be really easy, so I added it. I think it makes it much easier to see the cards 
2018-02-25 22:41:04	Jesse	oh nice!!! let me know if theres anything youd like me to change.  
2018-02-26 13:50:38	Jesse	I played both crazy eights and solitaire and I haven't noticed any bugs. winning looks good as well. 
2018-02-26 13:52:31	Jesse	we may be able to polish a few things up but honestly, it doesn't matter too much because we'll be taking parts of our code out and re implementing stuff for the second submission.

2018-03-16 10:06:54	Jesse	I'm gonna take a look now about what we can do to our project for submission 3. 
2018-03-16 10:13:12	Jesse	Nobody but me used cardsTest.py right? would you guys mind if I deleted that file? 
2018-03-16 10:17:46	Jesse	We may want to ask the professor about this... I worry our games are too different. 
2018-03-17 00:11:58	ajshryoc	You can delete cardsTest.py if no one is using it. I would probably make a new directory in the git repo called 'project3' or something so that we have a record of both of our submissions. As for the issues with the games, if you want to ask him, go ahead. I think we could make it work but I'm sure he could provide some insight. <--- Sorry typed this up about 14 hours ago and never hit send 
2018-03-19 14:19:24	Jesse	We got a 90% it seems on what we submitted for the project. He said he liked our nouns/verbs but was disappointed that we didn't make an FSM. He also linked "Derive Interfaces from Constraints of Data" as if its some reading on moodle or github. 
2018-03-19 14:19:57	Jesse	... I checked both, and I'm not sure what he's talking about 
2018-03-19 14:36:38	ajshryoc	I'm also unsure what he meant by that. Our design did get a shoutout in #proj2_mar1 though so that's pretty cool 
2018-03-19 14:38:04	Jesse	i didn't see that. that is pretty cool 
2018-03-19 14:38:44	ajshryoc	Also, just realized the section the he references is also in that Google doc with the feedback 
2018-03-19 15:03:59	jwstanl3	Even after looking at that section, I'm still not sure what he wants us to get from that. The lines he references are where the suits are printed in Crazy Eights to allow the user to select which suit to change to. I don't get how that could be changed. 
2018-03-19 16:30:23	ajshryoc	It could definitely be made better. I think the whole system, crazy eights especially, could benefit from state machines. I intended to cleanup some of that code, but I decided to just wait until this upcoming submission. I'll take a better look at the comments later 
2018-03-19 17:59:01	Jesse	I'm not sure I know how the system could be improved with FSMs. But if you know what you'd like to change, I could definitely help out with that. The issue I see with FSMs is that only crazy eights would use it... and it would just be wasted code for solitaire. 
2018-03-19 19:10:58	ajshryoc	I'm sure he'll provide more context tomorrow. I'll review their comments too and we can go from there 
2018-03-20 10:11:37	Jesse	Hey guys, I was checking out a few other peoples code, and i found one where they built the FSM setup stuff, and didn't call it anywhere in their code xD. I wonder if the graders caught it.

2018-03-21 12:56:29	Jesse	I figured it out.

2018-03-22 22:03:28	Jesse	I figured I should let you guys know I'm doing a little bit of refactoring on some of our code. Just in case you guys have made changes or something

2018-03-26 20:45:46	Jesse	hey guys, wanna meet up tomorrow to work on the plm project? 
2018-03-26 21:35:12	jwstanl3	Sure. Could we meet tomorrow after class? 
2018-03-26 21:59:18	Jesse	yeah 
2018-03-26 22:12:02	ajshryoc	That works for me 
2018-03-28 20:11:28	ajshryoc	@ajshryoc uploaded a file: https://plm18.slack.com/files/U8M1VEVT3/F9Y2C4G69/play_state_fsm.png (play_state_fsm.png) and commented: Hey guys, I drew up some state machine diagrams based on what we talked about yesterday.

2018-03-28 20:46:28	Jesse	I get what you mean, and I tried coding that up last night, but I'm struggling with what should be classes vs methods vs variables, and how should all of these things be linked up together?   
2018-03-28 20:49:16	Jesse	I guess the obvious answer would be to have all states and transitions be their own classes... but it also doesn't make sense for them to be their own classes when they might only have one variable or one method... and if the method just says pass, it doesn't really make sense to even have that method... 
2018-03-28 20:50:07	Jesse	And so you take the approach of having strings be states and methods being transitions... which is exactly how our code is now.. 
2018-03-28 20:50:32	Jesse	That's where my confusion with this project is. 
2018-03-28 20:52:56	ajshryoc	Yes, you're right and I'm not 100% sure how this implementation would work either. But, a lot of that I think could be solved by how it's implemented. For example, the State class could have a default implementation of each of its methods that is just "pass", that way, if you don't need the method, you don't worry about it. 
2018-03-28 20:55:40	ajshryoc	I think that Start, Play, Goal, and Fail could each be subclasses of State. When, as an example, Crazy Eights goes to instantiate a Start state, it should just have to pass in a lambda body that sets up the game. So, it wouldn't even need to subclass a new Start state (although it could). I think that it would look something like this: 
2018-03-28 20:55:45	ajshryoc	`start = new StartState(onEntry=setupCrazyEights)` 
2018-03-28 20:56:46	ajshryoc	`game.fsm = new FSM(start=start, play=runGame, end=endGame)` 
2018-03-28 20:57:07	ajshryoc	Or something like that. I may be oversimplifying things but I think it's doable 
2018-03-28 21:01:18	Jesse	I'll give it another shot tonight and let you know how it ends up tomorrow 
2018-03-28 21:02:43	ajshryoc	Okay, I will take a look at it too 
2018-03-28 21:24:44	Jesse	@Jesse uploaded a file: https://plm18.slack.com/files/U8N7VJU30/F9Z06TD0X/fsm.py (fsm) 
2018-03-28 21:24:51	Jesse	does that look like a good start? 
2018-03-28 21:32:03	Jesse	I really like the idea of passing in lambda bodies to abstract functions... that solved some of my 'why' questions earlier.. but its still kinda confusin  
2018-03-28 21:32:17	ajshryoc	Yeah, I think so. For the lambdas you pass in, you should just be able to pass in a function that performs the 'move' operation  (edited)
2018-03-28 21:32:36	ajshryoc	But, yeah I agree it is a little confusing 
2018-03-28 21:59:24	Jesse	nevermind, this whole thing seems stupid again... its like we're just making 4 methods for the sake of calling the same methods we would have initially. We pass the functions into some abstract class which just calls those methods in the abstract class... why not just call the functions? 
2018-03-28 22:04:45	Jesse	This whole process isn't saving us any lines of code... and as far as run-time and memory goes, this is more inefficient than what we've coded. It's even more unreadable too since theres more files for future programmers to go through. 
2018-03-28 23:14:21	ajshryoc	I'm working through a test version of crazy eights using an FSM, so hopefully that will help clear things up (if it works) 
2018-04-01 10:25:44		getting channel history...
2018-01-27 20:54:59	ajshryoc	Not familiar with solitaire? Or Bartok? 
2018-01-27 22:25:26	Jesse	bartok and crazy eight. 
2018-01-28 20:18:47	ajshryoc	Bartok is just the game where you have a hand and have to play cards that match a card with the same suit/rank until you run out of cards. Crazy Eights is just that with a couple of other additions, if I remember 
2018-01-28 20:33:54	Jesse	gotcha. well it may make it difficult if we choose a game vastly different from that, so idk if solitaire is a good idea... but I'm sure we could do it if we cant find a better game. 
2018-01-28 20:54:33	ajshryoc	I mean, technically our language should be able to create any kind of game so having two very different games to base it off of might actually be beneficial, although a little more work for the annotation. 
2018-01-28 20:55:28	Jesse	should we call dibs on solitaire then in the proj1 channel? 
2018-01-28 20:57:45	ajshryoc	I'm cool with that 
2018-01-28 21:11:35	ajshryoc	Do we have to claim both games? Or just the non-Bartok clone one? 
2018-01-28 21:12:15	Jesse	i guess juat the non-bartok 
2018-01-28 21:12:27	Jesse	just* 
2018-01-29 17:21:22	Jesse	When can you guys meet up to work on the card game annotations? 
2018-01-29 17:22:08	Jesse	I'm free up until 4:30 on thursday. 
2018-01-29 17:22:23	Jesse	or any time on friday 
2018-01-29 17:30:09	ajshryoc	Between 2 and 4:30 on Thursday works for me 
2018-01-29 17:33:21	Jesse	sounds good to me. 
2018-01-29 17:49:17	jwstanl3	I'm busy 2-6pm pretty much everyday except for Friday 
2018-01-29 17:50:03	Jesse	id be willing to meet up on friday. what about you andrew? 
2018-01-29 17:53:51	ajshryoc	I've got senior design 10:40-12:30 on friday and I typically work afterwards. I could meet before class if that is an option for you guys? Another suggestion would be after class Thursday 
2018-01-29 17:54:37	jwstanl3	I can meet after class Thursday 
2018-01-29 17:54:48	Jesse	Yeah I can do that 
2018-01-29 17:55:25	ajshryoc	Alright, cool 
2018-02-01 20:59:14	Jesse	hey guys, I put in a little bit at the end of the card game annotations. please check if theres anything you'd like to add or modify. 
2018-02-01 21:35:25	ajshryoc	That part looks good and I think was a smart addition 
2018-02-01 21:35:41	Jesse	thank you 
2018-02-01 21:37:41	ajshryoc	I will probably go back to this throughout the weekend if I think of more similarities/differences to add. Overall though, I think it looks good. I probably won't be able to put in a good chunk of time on this assignment until Monday, but I don't think it'll take that long to write out what we already have. 
2018-02-01 21:38:41	Jesse	when you mean write out, do you mean hand-written? 
2018-02-01 21:39:15	ajshryoc	Sorry, I mean like write out in a sentence rather than just a list 
2018-02-01 21:40:00	Jesse	Ahh.. I'm not too sure its important to have it in sentence form, but if you think that would be better, go for it xD 
2018-02-01 21:40:48	Jesse	i can of course help too.. just want to be sure thats something you think is important 
2018-02-01 21:42:56	ajshryoc	I suppose he doesn't really say what format it should be in and only says "list what is similar, what is different", so I'm not entirely sure what he's looking for. I think as long as it's clear we can have it in list form, maybe just with an intro paragraph for each section. 
2018-02-01 21:45:00	Jesse	I don't think he knows what he is looking for lol. And I'm not too sure what I would put in an intro paragraph. 
2018-02-01 23:04:13	ajshryoc	Yeah, good point. We can see how it is and how much time we want to put in next week. 
2018-02-05 21:28:33	ajshryoc	I'm working on the annotations a litte. Just trying to add some more words to the game descriptions. Let me know what you guys think and feel free to add anything 
2018-02-06 19:31:23	ajshryoc	I made a couple small additions to the annotation. Mainly just for formatting/flow. Let me know what you guys think and add whatever else you think we need. If you guys think it's good, I can submit the doc 
2018-02-06 20:39:28	Jesse	ill take a look now. sorry i was distracted 
2018-02-06 20:44:36	Jesse	well dang. thats a lot more of an improvement than i was expecting. Nice work Andrew  
2018-02-06 20:45:22	jwstanl3	Everything looks good 
2018-02-06 20:47:21	Jesse	yeah I agree. 
2018-02-06 20:48:54	Jesse	would you like me to submit? 
2018-02-06 20:49:09	ajshryoc	Thanks, just took what we had before and made it flow a little better  
2018-02-06 20:49:18	ajshryoc	Yeah, go ahead and submit if you want 
2018-02-06 20:50:39	Jesse	done 
2018-02-06 20:50:49	ajshryoc	Sweet 
2018-02-11 09:22:16	Jesse	Hey guys do either of you understand the homework? 
2018-02-11 11:38:18	ajshryoc	I have not taken a look at it so far. I just saw that Alex Phelps posted some tips in #homework that seemed helpful. Will probably get to the homework later today or tomorrow 
2018-02-11 11:49:28	Jesse	yeah. i gotcha 
2018-02-12 21:17:50	ajshryoc	Have you guys finished the homework? I think I've got it---it looks like it's behaving correctly, but I'm not sure what he wants exactly 
2018-02-13 10:43:30	Jesse	I submitted something but I don't think it's right at all. I just made the program look like it was doing something right and submittted it. 
2018-02-13 14:46:06	Jesse	I just pushed  a starter to our cardgame project in our github repo. check it out when ya get the chance. i was just sketching some things up so feel free to modify whatever. 
2018-02-13 15:46:25	ajshryoc	Okay, I'll check it out 
2018-02-14 21:35:45	ajshryoc	@ajshryoc shared a file: https://plm18.slack.com/files/U8M1VEVT3/F98NZUTNC/CSC495_Project_Todo_List (CSC495 Project Todo List) 
2018-02-14 21:35:45		@ajshryoc commented on @ajshryoc?s file https://plm18.slack.com/files/U8M1VEVT3/F98NZUTNC/CSC495_Project_Todo_List (CSC495 Project Todo List): Hey guys, I did a little design work on an approach I've thought of for implementing the two games based on some stuff we've talked about in class. I mainly just tried to break down the game object that were suggested we use in class in the context of a finite state machine. Let me know what you think and if you have suggestions/feedback. We could then write this up as GitHub issues. That way, we can assign things as tasks. 
2018-02-14 21:42:45	Jesse	thats a pretty solid writeup. I'll spend some more time looking over it later.  I think the most complex thing is going to be implementing rules and goals since they can vary  a lot from game to game. 
2018-02-14 21:44:58	ajshryoc	I agree. That along with what constitutes a valid move---especially with solitaire. 
2018-02-15 14:40:27	Jesse	hey guys, i'm gonna be late to class today. I've got a video call with the people i'll be interning with from 3:30 to 4:30. 
2018-02-16 00:07:50	ajshryoc	added an integration to this channel: https://plm18.slack.com/services/B9A0YJ9V1 (github) 
2018-02-16 00:12:00	ajshryoc	I've converted the list I wrote up yesterday into a few GitHub issues. Please feel free to take a look and modify if you see fit. With these we can more easily divide up tasks (or subtasks) and tag commits/branches with them. I also added the GitHub app to this channel, which will post when events happen on the repo. If it starts to get annoying, I can reduce the notifications or turn it off. Figured I'd give it a shot and see if it's useful for keeping everyone up to date on code changes 
2018-02-16 10:06:31	Jesse	I'll start working on this tomorrow. I'm dedicating today to English 331 and research. thanks for this Andrew. [:+1:1] 
2018-02-17 12:56:28	Jesse	I'm gonna be working on this project starting now. I'll try to document my work here. I'm willing to meet up at Hunt if you guys are interested, but it's not necessary. 
2018-02-17 13:04:31	ajshryoc	Sweet. I may work on this depending on how quickly I can do my networks homework today.  
2018-02-17 13:07:13	Jesse	Ok. I'm gonna be looking more into higher level design aspects rather than implementation. I'll let you know what I find. [:+1:1] 
2018-02-17 14:19:00	Jesse	I think I've worked out most of the ambiguous stuff. i can try to upload my notes but it is quite illegible, so ill have to meet with you guys some time to explain.
2018-02-17 14:19:00		Once I work out the rest of the thinking stuff, Ill try to lay out what needs to be done in the form of  a informal UML diagram. From there, I'm going to give out some tasks as far as implementation of this UML. 
2018-02-17 14:19:00		this is my goal for today.

2018-02-17 17:47:30	ajshryoc	Hey @jwstanl3, which one of the two games would you like to work on? 
2018-02-17 20:14:45	jwstanl3	I'll look into Solitaire. Sorry for taking so long to reply.

2018-02-19 10:14:55	Jesse	I dont think I updated you guys on what I did in that commit. I implemented the basic structure and started on the solitaire UI. I left the rulebook and other game specific things unimplemented. I would also like to expand the basic structures functionality to things like flipping over a card or moving sets of cards from one pile to another pile. 
2018-02-19 17:12:34	ajshryoc	Yeah, added functionality like that would be great. I'm not sure how difficult it would be, but it would be cool if the Pile class was iterable so that you could use it in a for loop. If it too complicated to add that don't worry about it

2018-02-19 21:55:53	Jesse	@Jesse uploaded a file: https://plm18.slack.com/files/U8N7VJU30/F9B15RLSV/2018-02-19-215521_873x245_scrot.png (solitaireUI.png) 
2018-02-19 21:56:00	Jesse	the UI for solitaire is starting to look good. 
2018-02-19 21:56:28	ajshryoc	Yeah, nice! 
2018-02-19 22:03:59	Jesse	I'm not gonna lie, the base code is a lil messy, so if theres any general features that you think needs to be in there just let me know and I can implement it. 
2018-02-19 22:04:46	Jesse	as for the UI, I'm making it so you guys just pass in a set of piles. and the index in the set of piles will determine which pile is positioned where. 
2018-02-19 22:05:46	Jesse	I also hardcoded the height of the board since we know that there will be no higher stack of cards than 13 (which is Ace-King) in solitaire 
2018-02-19 22:07:38	ajshryoc	That would be pretty sweet if we just have to pass in the piles. I think it looks pretty good. We can worry about code cleanup later too. 
2018-02-19 22:09:08	ajshryoc	I was able to get crazy eights working with just 1 player playing cards on the pile, so it looks like we're in a pretty good spot for this project 
2018-02-19 22:09:23	Jesse	dang really? thats pretty awesome 
2018-02-19 22:10:43	ajshryoc	It'll be a cool project once it's all working. The way we have it setup (with your cards.py objects) made it pretty straightforward to program 
2018-02-19 22:10:45	Jesse	can you tell me what the board would look like for crazy eight? is it just a pile for taking cards and a pile for laying cards? also displaying the hand to the player? 
2018-02-19 22:13:53	ajshryoc	@ajshryoc uploaded a file: https://plm18.slack.com/files/U8M1VEVT3/F9ATPNWBS/crazyeights.jpg (crazyeights.JPG) and commented: Here's what I've been using as a sort of debug UI.  So, there's the pile for taking cards, pile for playing cards, and the player's hand. I'm unsure how to handle the computer players since the number of card they hold is definitely relevant to the player. 
2018-02-19 22:14:54	ajshryoc	I think just listing the AI players and showing how many face down cards are in their hands on different lines would be good enough 
2018-02-19 22:16:20	ajshryoc	As a side note, I defined a Move as a Crazy Eights specific object (although it might be worth pulling out) that is defined by a Card, a "to" Pile, and a "from" Pile. It has a method called "make" that will remove the Card from "from" Pile and add it to "to" Pile. This kinda thing might be useful for solitaire too  (edited)
2018-02-19 22:17:59	Jesse	oh. I made a similar function in my Pile class (giveOneCard) 
2018-02-19 22:19:01	ajshryoc	No problem, that totally works. I'll adjust what I've got to match your code once I pull it in 
2018-02-19 22:19:20	Jesse	Would you guys be willing to meet up tomorrow so that we can clean up our code? / continue developing? 
2018-02-19 22:19:32	Jesse	I'm good all day except class time 
2018-02-19 22:20:10	ajshryoc	I'm good from around 1:30 to class time 
2018-02-19 22:24:03	Jesse	okay. I'd be down to meet then.

2018-02-20 07:46:29	jwstanl3	Would you guys be able to meet after class? I have a class from 1:30-2:45 and then I tutor from 3-4 
2018-02-20 10:30:28	Jesse	Yeah. Would you be able to meet after class andrew? I don't think we need a lot of time. My plan was just to use an hour or two to clean up some of the code in the generic game structure/UI's and implement any functionality you guys think would be good for both games. 
2018-02-20 10:32:21	Jesse	If not, I could meet with andrew an hour before class and then after class with Joseph for an hour. 
2018-02-20 11:36:11	ajshryoc	I could meet briefly right after class 
2018-02-20 11:36:34	Jesse	cool! 
2018-02-20 12:00:47	jwstanl3	I have the solitaire game pretty much working completely, but I changed some things in the cards and SolitaireUI files, so I'll wait until we meet to commit anything 
2018-02-20 12:03:24	jwstanl3	@jwstanl3 uploaded a file: https://plm18.slack.com/files/U8N1B358V/F9B8MRFL0/solitaire.gif (Solitaire GIF) and commented: Here's a GIF of the game.  The only thing I haven't implemented is win and loss states. 
2018-02-20 13:05:32	Jesse	thats awesome!! but arent the red cards supposed to go on black cards and vice versa? 
2018-02-20 13:05:45	Jesse	its okay if we want to change it for the sake of project scope 
2018-02-20 13:05:53	Jesse	to be red on red 
2018-02-20 13:08:42	jwstanl3	The rules from Bicycle didn't have any restrictions on color. It just had to be consecutive. But, yea, normally you would alternate colors, and it would be pretty easy to switch the program to follow that. 
2018-02-20 13:09:15	jwstanl3	The game's really easy at the moment, so adding something like that would help it be more challenging.

2018-02-21 20:28:57	jwstanl3	I pushed some fixes to my solitaire code. Cards have to alternate in color now in the stacks. There were a few other bugs I fixed. I still haven't added a win state, or a loss state really, but it should be able to detect a win or loss, if the loss state doesn't have any moves left. I haven't been able to beat the game since adding the alternating colors, so I'm not sure if this is true or not.

2018-02-22 22:08:38	ajshryoc	Added what I have for crazy eights. I think the only major feature missing is the suit change when playing an 8. I also intend to clean up the code and little bit to get rid of redundancy.  (edited)
2018-02-22 22:12:02	Jesse	great!! I'll probably take a look some time this weekend

2018-02-24 12:28:32	Jesse	Do you guys understand python decorators? I haven't been able to reproduce a function that demonstrates the difference with/without the decorator. 
2018-02-25 20:28:31	ajshryoc	Sorry, intended to respond, then totally forgot about this. My understanding of python decorators is it's just another form of syntax for calling functions; however, it sort of ties two functions together and modifies the function being decorated. Here's an article I found that gives a good explanation on the subject: http://python-3-patterns-idioms-test.readthedocs.io/en/latest/PythonDecorators.html

2018-02-25 22:39:22	ajshryoc	Just pushed the finished version of Crazy Eights. It's kinda a mess, so I'll probably do some refactoring of it at some point. I also modified cards.py to print out the unicode symbol corresponding to the card's suit. I was curious about how to do it and it turned out to be really easy, so I added it. I think it makes it much easier to see the cards 
2018-02-25 22:41:04	Jesse	oh nice!!! let me know if theres anything youd like me to change.  
2018-02-26 13:50:38	Jesse	I played both crazy eights and solitaire and I haven't noticed any bugs. winning looks good as well. 
2018-02-26 13:52:31	Jesse	we may be able to polish a few things up but honestly, it doesn't matter too much because we'll be taking parts of our code out and re implementing stuff for the second submission. I think what we have is gold. If there's anything you guys want me to change, just let me know.

2018-03-12 13:12:50	ajshryoc	I don't have a transcript. You should be able to use the tee command to output to a file and stdout 
2018-03-12 13:13:04	Jesse	I was just gonna use script

2018-03-16 10:13:12	Jesse	Nobody but me used cardsTest.py right? would you guys mind if I deleted that file? 
2018-03-16 10:17:46	Jesse	We may want to ask the professor about this... I worry our games are too different. 
2018-03-17 00:11:58	ajshryoc	You can delete cardsTest.py if no one is using it. I would probably make a new directory in the git repo called 'project3' or something so that we have a record of both of our submissions. As for the issues with the games, if you want to ask him, go ahead. I think we could make it work but I'm sure he could provide some insight. <--- Sorry typed this up about 14 hours ago and never hit send 
2018-03-19 14:19:24	Jesse	We got a 90% it seems on what we submitted for the project. He said he liked our nouns/verbs but was disappointed that we didn't make an FSM. He also linked "Derive Interfaces from Constraints of Data" as if its some reading on moodle or github. 
2018-03-19 14:19:57	Jesse	... I checked both, and I'm not sure what he's talking about 
2018-03-19 14:36:38	ajshryoc	I'm also unsure what he meant by that. Our design did get a shoutout in #proj2_mar1 though so that's pretty cool 
2018-03-19 14:38:04	Jesse	i didn't see that. that is pretty cool 
2018-03-19 14:38:44	ajshryoc	Also, just realized the section the he references is also in that Google doc with the feedback 
2018-03-19 15:03:59	jwstanl3	Even after looking at that section, I'm still not sure what he wants us to get from that. The lines he references are where the suits are printed in Crazy Eights to allow the user to select which suit to change to. I don't get how that could be changed. 
2018-03-19 16:30:23	ajshryoc	It could definitely be made better. I think the whole system, crazy eights especially, could benefit from state machines. I intended to cleanup some of that code, but I decided to just wait until this upcoming submission. I'll take a better look at the comments later 
2018-03-19 17:59:01	Jesse	I'm not sure I know how the system could be improved with FSMs. But if you know what you'd like to change, I could definitely help out with that. The issue I see with FSMs is that only crazy eights would use it... and it would just be wasted code for solitaire. 
2018-03-19 19:10:58	ajshryoc	I'm sure he'll provide more context tomorrow. I'll review their comments too and we can go from there 
2018-03-20 10:11:37	Jesse	Hey guys, I was checking out a few other peoples code, and i found one where they built the FSM setup stuff, and didn't call it anywhere in their code xD. I wonder if the graders caught it.

2018-03-22 22:03:28	Jesse	I figured I should let you guys know I'm doing a little bit of refactoring on some of our code. Just in case you guys have made changes or something

2018-03-26 20:45:46	Jesse	hey guys, wanna meet up tomorrow to work on the plm project? 
2018-03-26 21:35:12	jwstanl3	Sure. Could we meet tomorrow after class? 
2018-03-26 21:59:18	Jesse	yeah 
2018-03-26 22:12:02	ajshryoc	That works for me 
2018-03-28 20:11:28	ajshryoc	@ajshryoc uploaded a file: https://plm18.slack.com/files/U8M1VEVT3/F9Y2C4G69/play_state_fsm.png (play_state_fsm.png) and commented: Hey guys, I drew up some state machine diagrams based on what we talked about yesterday.

2018-03-28 20:46:28	Jesse	I get what you mean, and I tried coding that up last night, but I'm struggling with what should be classes vs methods vs variables, and how should all of these things be linked up together?   
2018-03-28 20:49:16	Jesse	I guess the obvious answer would be to have all states and transitions be their own classes... but it also doesn't make sense for them to be their own classes when they might only have one variable or one method... and if the method just says pass, it doesn't really make sense to even have that method... 
2018-03-28 20:50:07	Jesse	And so you take the approach of having strings be states and methods being transitions... which is exactly how our code is now.. 
2018-03-28 20:50:32	Jesse	That's where my confusion with this project is. 
2018-03-28 20:52:56	ajshryoc	Yes, you're right and I'm not 100% sure how this implementation would work either. But, a lot of that I think could be solved by how it's implemented. For example, the State class could have a default implementation of each of its methods that is just "pass", that way, if you don't need the method, you don't worry about it. 
2018-03-28 20:55:40	ajshryoc	I think that Start, Play, Goal, and Fail could each be subclasses of State. When, as an example, Crazy Eights goes to instantiate a Start state, it should just have to pass in a lambda body that sets up the game. So, it wouldn't even need to subclass a new Start state (although it could). I think that it would look something like this: 
2018-03-28 20:55:45	ajshryoc	`start = new StartState(onEntry=setupCrazyEights)` 
2018-03-28 20:56:46	ajshryoc	`game.fsm = new FSM(start=start, play=runGame, end=endGame)` 
2018-03-28 20:57:07	ajshryoc	Or something like that. I may be oversimplifying things but I think it's doable 
2018-03-28 21:01:18	Jesse	I'll give it another shot tonight and let you know how it ends up tomorrow 
2018-03-28 21:02:43	ajshryoc	Okay, I will take a look at it too 
2018-03-28 21:24:44	Jesse	@Jesse uploaded a file: https://plm18.slack.com/files/U8N7VJU30/F9Z06TD0X/fsm.py (fsm) 
2018-03-28 21:24:51	Jesse	does that look like a good start? 
2018-03-28 21:32:03	Jesse	I really like the idea of passing in lambda bodies to abstract functions... that solved some of my 'why' questions earlier.. but its still kinda confusin  
2018-03-28 21:32:17	ajshryoc	Yeah, I think so. For the lambdas you pass in, you should just be able to pass in a function that performs the 'move' operation  (edited)
2018-03-28 21:32:36	ajshryoc	But, yeah I agree it is a little confusing 
2018-03-28 21:59:24	Jesse	nevermind, this whole thing seems stupid again... its like we're just making 4 methods for the sake of calling the same methods we would have initially. We pass the functions into some abstract class which just calls those methods in the abstract class... why not just call the functions? 
2018-03-28 22:04:45	Jesse	This whole process isn't saving us any lines of code... and as far as run-time and memory goes, this is more inefficient than what we've coded. It's even more unreadable too since theres more files for future programmers to go through. 
2018-03-28 23:14:21	ajshryoc	I'm working through a test version of crazy eights using an FSM, so hopefully that will help clear things up (if it works) 
2018-04-02 16:56:31		getting channel history...
2018-01-27 20:54:59	ajshryoc	Not familiar with solitaire? Or Bartok? 
2018-01-27 22:25:26	Jesse	bartok and crazy eight. 
2018-01-28 20:18:47	ajshryoc	Bartok is just the game where you have a hand and have to play cards that match a card with the same suit/rank until you run out of cards. Crazy Eights is just that with a couple of other additions, if I remember 
2018-01-28 20:33:54	Jesse	gotcha. well it may make it difficult if we choose a game vastly different from that, so idk if solitaire is a good idea... but I'm sure we could do it if we cant find a better game. 
2018-01-28 20:54:33	ajshryoc	I mean, technically our language should be able to create any kind of game so having two very different games to base it off of might actually be beneficial, although a little more work for the annotation. 
2018-01-28 20:55:28	Jesse	should we call dibs on solitaire then in the proj1 channel? 
2018-01-28 20:57:45	ajshryoc	I'm cool with that 
2018-01-28 21:11:35	ajshryoc	Do we have to claim both games? Or just the non-Bartok clone one? 
2018-01-28 21:12:15	Jesse	i guess juat the non-bartok 
2018-01-28 21:12:27	Jesse	just* 
2018-01-29 17:21:22	Jesse	When can you guys meet up to work on the card game annotations? 
2018-01-29 17:22:08	Jesse	I'm free up until 4:30 on thursday. 
2018-01-29 17:22:23	Jesse	or any time on friday 
2018-01-29 17:30:09	ajshryoc	Between 2 and 4:30 on Thursday works for me 
2018-01-29 17:33:21	Jesse	sounds good to me. 
2018-01-29 17:49:17	jwstanl3	I'm busy 2-6pm pretty much everyday except for Friday 
2018-01-29 17:50:03	Jesse	id be willing to meet up on friday. what about you andrew? 
2018-01-29 17:53:51	ajshryoc	I've got senior design 10:40-12:30 on friday and I typically work afterwards. I could meet before class if that is an option for you guys? Another suggestion would be after class Thursday 
2018-01-29 17:54:37	jwstanl3	I can meet after class Thursday 
2018-01-29 17:54:48	Jesse	Yeah I can do that 
2018-01-29 17:55:25	ajshryoc	Alright, cool 
2018-02-01 20:59:14	Jesse	hey guys, I put in a little bit at the end of the card game annotations. please check if theres anything you'd like to add or modify. 
2018-02-01 21:35:25	ajshryoc	That part looks good and I think was a smart addition 
2018-02-01 21:35:41	Jesse	thank you 
2018-02-01 21:37:41	ajshryoc	I will probably go back to this throughout the weekend if I think of more similarities/differences to add. Overall though, I think it looks good. I probably won't be able to put in a good chunk of time on this assignment until Monday, but I don't think it'll take that long to write out what we already have. 
2018-02-01 21:38:41	Jesse	when you mean write out, do you mean hand-written? 
2018-02-01 21:39:15	ajshryoc	Sorry, I mean like write out in a sentence rather than just a list 
2018-02-01 21:40:00	Jesse	Ahh.. I'm not too sure its important to have it in sentence form, but if you think that would be better, go for it xD 
2018-02-01 21:40:48	Jesse	i can of course help too.. just want to be sure thats something you think is important 
2018-02-01 21:42:56	ajshryoc	I suppose he doesn't really say what format it should be in and only says "list what is similar, what is different", so I'm not entirely sure what he's looking for. I think as long as it's clear we can have it in list form, maybe just with an intro paragraph for each section. 
2018-02-01 21:45:00	Jesse	I don't think he knows what he is looking for lol. And I'm not too sure what I would put in an intro paragraph. 
2018-02-01 23:04:13	ajshryoc	Yeah, good point. We can see how it is and how much time we want to put in next week. 
2018-02-05 21:28:33	ajshryoc	I'm working on the annotations a litte. Just trying to add some more words to the game descriptions. Let me know what you guys think and feel free to add anything 
2018-02-06 19:31:23	ajshryoc	I made a couple small additions to the annotation. Mainly just for formatting/flow. Let me know what you guys think and add whatever else you think we need. If you guys think it's good, I can submit the doc 
2018-02-06 20:39:28	Jesse	ill take a look now. sorry i was distracted 
2018-02-06 20:44:36	Jesse	well dang. thats a lot more of an improvement than i was expecting. Nice work Andrew  
2018-02-06 20:45:22	jwstanl3	Everything looks good 
2018-02-06 20:47:21	Jesse	yeah I agree. 
2018-02-06 20:48:54	Jesse	would you like me to submit? 
2018-02-06 20:49:09	ajshryoc	Thanks, just took what we had before and made it flow a little better  
2018-02-06 20:49:18	ajshryoc	Yeah, go ahead and submit if you want 
2018-02-06 20:50:39	Jesse	done 
2018-02-06 20:50:49	ajshryoc	Sweet 
2018-02-11 09:22:16	Jesse	Hey guys do either of you understand the homework? 
2018-02-11 11:38:18	ajshryoc	I have not taken a look at it so far. I just saw that Alex Phelps posted some tips in #homework that seemed helpful. Will probably get to the homework later today or tomorrow 
2018-02-11 11:49:28	Jesse	yeah. i gotcha 
2018-02-12 21:17:50	ajshryoc	Have you guys finished the homework? I think I've got it---it looks like it's behaving correctly, but I'm not sure what he wants exactly 
2018-02-13 10:43:30	Jesse	I submitted something but I don't think it's right at all. I just made the program look like it was doing something right and submittted it. 
2018-02-13 14:46:06	Jesse	I just pushed  a starter to our cardgame project in our github repo. check it out when ya get the chance. i was just sketching some things up so feel free to modify whatever. 
2018-02-13 15:46:25	ajshryoc	Okay, I'll check it out 
2018-02-14 21:35:45	ajshryoc	@ajshryoc shared a file: https://plm18.slack.com/files/U8M1VEVT3/F98NZUTNC/CSC495_Project_Todo_List (CSC495 Project Todo List) 
2018-02-14 21:35:45		@ajshryoc commented on @ajshryoc?s file https://plm18.slack.com/files/U8M1VEVT3/F98NZUTNC/CSC495_Project_Todo_List (CSC495 Project Todo List): Hey guys, I did a little design work on an approach I've thought of for implementing the two games based on some stuff we've talked about in class. I mainly just tried to break down the game object that were suggested we use in class in the context of a finite state machine. Let me know what you think and if you have suggestions/feedback. We could then write this up as GitHub issues. That way, we can assign things as tasks. 
2018-02-14 21:42:45	Jesse	thats a pretty solid writeup. I'll spend some more time looking over it later.  I think the most complex thing is going to be implementing rules and goals since they can vary  a lot from game to game. 
2018-02-14 21:44:58	ajshryoc	I agree. That along with what constitutes a valid move---especially with solitaire. 
2018-02-15 14:40:27	Jesse	hey guys, i'm gonna be late to class today. I've got a video call with the people i'll be interning with from 3:30 to 4:30. 
2018-02-16 00:07:50	ajshryoc	added an integration to this channel: https://plm18.slack.com/services/B9A0YJ9V1 (github) 
2018-02-16 00:12:00	ajshryoc	I've converted the list I wrote up yesterday into a few GitHub issues. Please feel free to take a look and modify if you see fit. With these we can more easily divide up tasks (or subtasks) and tag commits/branches with them. I also added the GitHub app to this channel, which will post when events happen on the repo. If it starts to get annoying, I can reduce the notifications or turn it off. Figured I'd give it a shot and see if it's useful for keeping everyone up to date on code changes 
2018-02-16 10:06:31	Jesse	I'll start working on this tomorrow. I'm dedicating today to English 331 and research. thanks for this Andrew. [:+1:1] 
2018-02-17 12:56:28	Jesse	I'm gonna be working on this project starting now. I'll try to document my work here. I'm willing to meet up at Hunt if you guys are interested, but it's not necessary. 
2018-02-17 13:04:31	ajshryoc	Sweet. I may work on this depending on how quickly I can do my networks homework today.  
2018-02-17 13:07:13	Jesse	Ok. I'm gonna be looking more into higher level design aspects rather than implementation. I'll let you know what I find. [:+1:1] 
2018-02-17 14:19:00	Jesse	I think I've worked out most of the ambiguous stuff. i can try to upload my notes but it is quite illegible, so ill have to meet with you guys some time to explain.
2018-02-17 14:19:00		Once I work out the rest of the thinking stuff, Ill try to lay out what needs to be done in the form of  a informal UML diagram. From there, I'm going to give out some tasks as far as implementation of this UML. 
2018-02-17 14:19:00		this is my goal for today.

2018-02-19 10:14:55	Jesse	I dont think I updated you guys on what I did in that commit. I implemented the basic structure and started on the solitaire UI. I left the rulebook and other game specific things unimplemented. I would also like to expand the basic structures functionality to things like flipping over a card or moving sets of cards from one pile to another pile. 
2018-02-19 17:12:34	ajshryoc	Yeah, added functionality like that would be great. I'm not sure how difficult it would be, but it would be cool if the Pile class was iterable so that you could use it in a for loop. If it too complicated to add that don't worry about it

2018-02-19 21:24:57	Jesse	I added functionality for piles giving one card or giving a set of cards. [:+1:1]

2018-02-19 21:56:00	Jesse	the UI for solitaire is starting to look good. 
2018-02-19 21:56:28	ajshryoc	Yeah, nice! 
2018-02-19 22:03:59	Jesse	I'm not gonna lie, the base code is a lil messy, so if theres any general features that you think needs to be in there just let me know and I can implement it. 
2018-02-19 22:04:46	Jesse	as for the UI, I'm making it so you guys just pass in a set of piles. and the index in the set of piles will determine which pile is positioned where. 
2018-02-19 22:05:46	Jesse	I also hardcoded the height of the board since we know that there will be no higher stack of cards than 13 (which is Ace-King) in solitaire 
2018-02-19 22:07:38	ajshryoc	That would be pretty sweet if we just have to pass in the piles. I think it looks pretty good. We can worry about code cleanup later too. 
2018-02-19 22:09:08	ajshryoc	I was able to get crazy eights working with just 1 player playing cards on the pile, so it looks like we're in a pretty good spot for this project 
2018-02-19 22:09:23	Jesse	dang really? thats pretty awesome 
2018-02-19 22:10:43	ajshryoc	It'll be a cool project once it's all working. The way we have it setup (with your cards.py objects) made it pretty straightforward to program 
2018-02-19 22:10:45	Jesse	can you tell me what the board would look like for crazy eight? is it just a pile for taking cards and a pile for laying cards? also displaying the hand to the player? 
2018-02-19 22:13:53	ajshryoc	@ajshryoc uploaded a file: https://plm18.slack.com/files/U8M1VEVT3/F9ATPNWBS/crazyeights.jpg (crazyeights.JPG) and commented: Here's what I've been using as a sort of debug UI.  So, there's the pile for taking cards, pile for playing cards, and the player's hand. I'm unsure how to handle the computer players since the number of card they hold is definitely relevant to the player. 
2018-02-19 22:14:54	ajshryoc	I think just listing the AI players and showing how many face down cards are in their hands on different lines would be good enough 
2018-02-19 22:16:20	ajshryoc	As a side note, I defined a Move as a Crazy Eights specific object (although it might be worth pulling out) that is defined by a Card, a "to" Pile, and a "from" Pile. It has a method called "make" that will remove the Card from "from" Pile and add it to "to" Pile. This kinda thing might be useful for solitaire too  (edited)
2018-02-19 22:17:59	Jesse	oh. I made a similar function in my Pile class (giveOneCard) 
2018-02-19 22:19:01	ajshryoc	No problem, that totally works. I'll adjust what I've got to match your code once I pull it in 
2018-02-19 22:19:20	Jesse	Would you guys be willing to meet up tomorrow so that we can clean up our code? / continue developing? 
2018-02-19 22:19:32	Jesse	I'm good all day except class time 
2018-02-19 22:20:10	ajshryoc	I'm good from around 1:30 to class time

2018-02-20 10:30:28	Jesse	Yeah. Would you be able to meet after class andrew? I don't think we need a lot of time. My plan was just to use an hour or two to clean up some of the code in the generic game structure/UI's and implement any functionality you guys think would be good for both games. 
2018-02-20 10:32:21	Jesse	If not, I could meet with andrew an hour before class and then after class with Joseph for an hour. 
2018-02-20 11:36:11	ajshryoc	I could meet briefly right after class 
2018-02-20 11:36:34	Jesse	cool! 
2018-02-20 12:00:47	jwstanl3	I have the solitaire game pretty much working completely, but I changed some things in the cards and SolitaireUI files, so I'll wait until we meet to commit anything 
2018-02-20 12:03:24	jwstanl3	@jwstanl3 uploaded a file: https://plm18.slack.com/files/U8N1B358V/F9B8MRFL0/solitaire.gif (Solitaire GIF) and commented: Here's a GIF of the game.  The only thing I haven't implemented is win and loss states. 
2018-02-20 13:05:32	Jesse	thats awesome!! but arent the red cards supposed to go on black cards and vice versa? 
2018-02-20 13:05:45	Jesse	its okay if we want to change it for the sake of project scope 
2018-02-20 13:05:53	Jesse	to be red on red 
2018-02-20 13:08:42	jwstanl3	The rules from Bicycle didn't have any restrictions on color. It just had to be consecutive. But, yea, normally you would alternate colors, and it would be pretty easy to switch the program to follow that. 
2018-02-20 13:09:15	jwstanl3	The game's really easy at the moment, so adding something like that would help it be more challenging.

2018-02-21 20:28:57	jwstanl3	I pushed some fixes to my solitaire code. Cards have to alternate in color now in the stacks. There were a few other bugs I fixed. I still haven't added a win state, or a loss state really, but it should be able to detect a win or loss, if the loss state doesn't have any moves left. I haven't been able to beat the game since adding the alternating colors, so I'm not sure if this is true or not.

2018-02-22 22:08:38	ajshryoc	Added what I have for crazy eights. I think the only major feature missing is the suit change when playing an 8. I also intend to clean up the code and little bit to get rid of redundancy.  (edited)

2018-02-24 12:28:32	Jesse	Do you guys understand python decorators? I haven't been able to reproduce a function that demonstrates the difference with/without the decorator. 
2018-02-25 20:28:31	ajshryoc	Sorry, intended to respond, then totally forgot about this. My understanding of python decorators is it's just another form of syntax for calling functions; however, it sort of ties two functions together and modifies the function being decorated. Here's an article I found that gives a good explanation on the subject: http://python-3-patterns-idioms-test.readthedocs.io/en/latest/PythonDecorators.html

2018-02-25 22:39:22	ajshryoc	Just pushed the finished version of Crazy Eights. It's kinda a mess, so I'll probably do some refactoring of it at some point. I also modified cards.py to print out the unicode symbol corresponding to the card's suit. I was curious about how to do it and it turned out to be really easy, so I added it. I think it makes it much easier to see the cards 
2018-02-25 22:41:04	Jesse	oh nice!!! let me know if theres anything youd like me to change.  
2018-02-26 13:50:38	Jesse	I played both crazy eights and solitaire and I haven't noticed any bugs. winning looks good as well. 
2018-02-26 13:52:31	Jesse	we may be able to polish a few things up but honestly, it doesn't matter too much because we'll be taking parts of our code out and re implementing stuff for the second submission. I think what we have is gold. If there's anything you guys want me to change, just let me know. 
2018-02-26 17:12:29	ajshryoc	Glad you liked it! I think they both play pretty well 
2018-03-12 13:07:36	Jesse	Hey guys, we need to figure out what we need to submit and submit it before class tomorrow. 
2018-03-12 13:11:03	Jesse	Do you guys have the transcript of the 2 games? if not I can make them. 
2018-03-12 13:12:50	ajshryoc	I don't have a transcript. You should be able to use the tee command to output to a file and stdout 
2018-03-12 13:13:04	Jesse	I was just gonna use script 
2018-03-12 13:13:18	Jesse	it automatically outputs the log to a file

2018-03-16 10:06:54	Jesse	I'm gonna take a look now about what we can do to our project for submission 3. 
2018-03-16 10:13:12	Jesse	Nobody but me used cardsTest.py right? would you guys mind if I deleted that file? 
2018-03-16 10:17:46	Jesse	We may want to ask the professor about this... I worry our games are too different. 
2018-03-17 00:11:58	ajshryoc	You can delete cardsTest.py if no one is using it. I would probably make a new directory in the git repo called 'project3' or something so that we have a record of both of our submissions. As for the issues with the games, if you want to ask him, go ahead. I think we could make it work but I'm sure he could provide some insight. <--- Sorry typed this up about 14 hours ago and never hit send 
2018-03-19 14:19:24	Jesse	We got a 90% it seems on what we submitted for the project. He said he liked our nouns/verbs but was disappointed that we didn't make an FSM. He also linked "Derive Interfaces from Constraints of Data" as if its some reading on moodle or github. 
2018-03-19 14:19:57	Jesse	... I checked both, and I'm not sure what he's talking about 
2018-03-19 14:36:38	ajshryoc	I'm also unsure what he meant by that. Our design did get a shoutout in #proj2_mar1 though so that's pretty cool 
2018-03-19 14:38:04	Jesse	i didn't see that. that is pretty cool 
2018-03-19 14:38:44	ajshryoc	Also, just realized the section the he references is also in that Google doc with the feedback 
2018-03-19 15:03:59	jwstanl3	Even after looking at that section, I'm still not sure what he wants us to get from that. The lines he references are where the suits are printed in Crazy Eights to allow the user to select which suit to change to. I don't get how that could be changed. 
2018-03-19 16:30:23	ajshryoc	It could definitely be made better. I think the whole system, crazy eights especially, could benefit from state machines. I intended to cleanup some of that code, but I decided to just wait until this upcoming submission. I'll take a better look at the comments later 
2018-03-19 17:59:01	Jesse	I'm not sure I know how the system could be improved with FSMs. But if you know what you'd like to change, I could definitely help out with that. The issue I see with FSMs is that only crazy eights would use it... and it would just be wasted code for solitaire. 
2018-03-19 19:10:58	ajshryoc	I'm sure he'll provide more context tomorrow. I'll review their comments too and we can go from there 
2018-03-20 10:11:37	Jesse	Hey guys, I was checking out a few other peoples code, and i found one where they built the FSM setup stuff, and didn't call it anywhere in their code xD. I wonder if the graders caught it.

2018-03-28 20:46:28	Jesse	I get what you mean, and I tried coding that up last night, but I'm struggling with what should be classes vs methods vs variables, and how should all of these things be linked up together?   
2018-03-28 20:49:16	Jesse	I guess the obvious answer would be to have all states and transitions be their own classes... but it also doesn't make sense for them to be their own classes when they might only have one variable or one method... and if the method just says pass, it doesn't really make sense to even have that method... 
2018-03-28 20:50:07	Jesse	And so you take the approach of having strings be states and methods being transitions... which is exactly how our code is now.. 
2018-03-28 20:50:32	Jesse	That's where my confusion with this project is. 
2018-03-28 20:52:56	ajshryoc	Yes, you're right and I'm not 100% sure how this implementation would work either. But, a lot of that I think could be solved by how it's implemented. For example, the State class could have a default implementation of each of its methods that is just "pass", that way, if you don't need the method, you don't worry about it. 
2018-03-28 20:55:40	ajshryoc	I think that Start, Play, Goal, and Fail could each be subclasses of State. When, as an example, Crazy Eights goes to instantiate a Start state, it should just have to pass in a lambda body that sets up the game. So, it wouldn't even need to subclass a new Start state (although it could). I think that it would look something like this: 
2018-03-28 20:55:45	ajshryoc	`start = new StartState(onEntry=setupCrazyEights)` 
2018-03-28 20:56:46	ajshryoc	`game.fsm = new FSM(start=start, play=runGame, end=endGame)` 
2018-03-28 20:57:07	ajshryoc	Or something like that. I may be oversimplifying things but I think it's doable 
2018-03-28 21:01:18	Jesse	I'll give it another shot tonight and let you know how it ends up tomorrow 
2018-03-28 21:02:43	ajshryoc	Okay, I will take a look at it too 
2018-03-28 21:24:44	Jesse	@Jesse uploaded a file: https://plm18.slack.com/files/U8N7VJU30/F9Z06TD0X/fsm.py (fsm) 
2018-03-28 21:24:51	Jesse	does that look like a good start? 
2018-03-28 21:32:03	Jesse	I really like the idea of passing in lambda bodies to abstract functions... that solved some of my 'why' questions earlier.. but its still kinda confusin  
2018-03-28 21:32:17	ajshryoc	Yeah, I think so. For the lambdas you pass in, you should just be able to pass in a function that performs the 'move' operation  (edited)
2018-03-28 21:32:36	ajshryoc	But, yeah I agree it is a little confusing 
2018-03-28 21:59:24	Jesse	nevermind, this whole thing seems stupid again... its like we're just making 4 methods for the sake of calling the same methods we would have initially. We pass the functions into some abstract class which just calls those methods in the abstract class... why not just call the functions? 
2018-03-28 22:04:45	Jesse	This whole process isn't saving us any lines of code... and as far as run-time and memory goes, this is more inefficient than what we've coded. It's even more unreadable too since theres more files for future programmers to go through. 
2018-03-28 23:14:21	ajshryoc	I'm working through a test version of crazy eights using an FSM, so hopefully that will help clear things up (if it works) 
2018-04-02 16:59:46	Jesse	Would either of you be free tonight to work on the plm stuff? or at least be free to instruct me on how I can help with the plm stuff? (since I haven't been very helpful so far) 
2018-04-02 17:32:35	ajshryoc	I am not free tonight to meet, but I should be able to push a working version of Crazy Eights with the FSM. Hopefully that will clear things up on how to implement the games with an FSM. Do you have ideas on things to change other than re-implementing the games with an FSM? 
2018-04-02 17:53:32	Jesse	not really, but we also have a paper we have to write. If I cannot find any improvements to the code, I'll try to get started on that.

2018-04-02 18:49:50	ajshryoc	I committed what I have so far to the other branch. You're welcome to take a look at it and continue developing it if that interests you. My approach so far has been to shove as much of what we already had as possible into the FSM. When I get back later, I will probably start rebuilding some of the functions passed into the FSM from the ground up to get rid of any issues I am just completely overlooking 
2018-04-02 19:10:11	Jesse	I think I'm going to get all of the non-fsm stuff into the CrazyEights.py file so it can be a lil more organized.

2018-04-02 20:17:07	ajshryoc	I like that idea. I was originally going to just have two versions of Crazy Eights until I got the FSM one working and then copy that over into CrazyEights.py, but I like your separation of logic here. I think at the very least we could label the FSM specification as the "domain specific language" he's looking for especially now that it's separated. 
2018-04-02 20:17:52	ajshryoc	Like I said before, I'm going to try re-writing the game logic to make it better-suited to the FSM to hopefully get rid of the bugs 
2018-04-02 20:18:24	Jesse	ok. im makin some changes now so don't do anything big :P 
2018-04-02 20:19:16	ajshryoc	Okay, no problem. Anything specific you are looking at or I should avoid? 
2018-04-02 20:20:56	Jesse	im trying to have everything output to a log file. it's just annoying because of how python handles inheritance 
2018-04-02 20:29:47	Jesse	the stupidly annoying thing about the log file is that every object needs one, and I can't open the same file multiple times without problems I don't think. 
2018-04-02 20:35:00	Jesse	i just undid my changes. You're free to edit it 
2018-04-02 20:35:22	ajshryoc	I'm unfamiliar with logs in python. Is there a specific package for it that giving you trouble or just using file i/o? 
2018-04-02 20:35:46	Jesse	I tried both  
2018-04-02 20:37:07	Jesse	either way, it would make us have a ton of duplicated code if we tried to put it in there.  
2018-04-02 20:54:54	Jesse	im gonna try to implement the solitaire stuff like you have with the fsms 
2018-04-02 20:56:14	ajshryoc	Okay, how do you want to get the FSM code? I could merge to master or you could branch off of crazy-eights-fsm 
2018-04-02 20:57:07	Jesse	ill just branch off crazy-eights-fsm 
2018-04-02 21:59:48	Jesse	it doesn't look like the guards are being called. 
2018-04-02 21:59:50	Jesse	are they? 
2018-04-02 22:50:13	Jesse	theres some bugs in the solitaire fsm but its pretty much there. 
2018-04-03 16:38:26		getting channel history...
2018-02-01 21:45:00	Jesse	I don't think he knows what he is looking for lol. And I'm not too sure what I would put in an intro paragraph. 
2018-02-01 23:04:13	ajshryoc	Yeah, good point. We can see how it is and how much time we want to put in next week. 
2018-02-05 21:28:33	ajshryoc	I'm working on the annotations a litte. Just trying to add some more words to the game descriptions. Let me know what you guys think and feel free to add anything 
2018-02-06 19:31:23	ajshryoc	I made a couple small additions to the annotation. Mainly just for formatting/flow. Let me know what you guys think and add whatever else you think we need. If you guys think it's good, I can submit the doc 
2018-02-06 20:39:28	Jesse	ill take a look now. sorry i was distracted 
2018-02-06 20:44:36	Jesse	well dang. thats a lot more of an improvement than i was expecting. Nice work Andrew  
2018-02-06 20:45:22	jwstanl3	Everything looks good 
2018-02-06 20:47:21	Jesse	yeah I agree. 
2018-02-06 20:48:54	Jesse	would you like me to submit? 
2018-02-06 20:49:09	ajshryoc	Thanks, just took what we had before and made it flow a little better  
2018-02-06 20:49:18	ajshryoc	Yeah, go ahead and submit if you want 
2018-02-06 20:50:39	Jesse	done 
2018-02-06 20:50:49	ajshryoc	Sweet 
2018-02-11 09:22:16	Jesse	Hey guys do either of you understand the homework? 
2018-02-11 11:38:18	ajshryoc	I have not taken a look at it so far. I just saw that Alex Phelps posted some tips in #homework that seemed helpful. Will probably get to the homework later today or tomorrow 
2018-02-11 11:49:28	Jesse	yeah. i gotcha 
2018-02-12 21:17:50	ajshryoc	Have you guys finished the homework? I think I've got it---it looks like it's behaving correctly, but I'm not sure what he wants exactly 
2018-02-13 10:43:30	Jesse	I submitted something but I don't think it's right at all. I just made the program look like it was doing something right and submittted it. 
2018-02-13 14:46:06	Jesse	I just pushed  a starter to our cardgame project in our github repo. check it out when ya get the chance. i was just sketching some things up so feel free to modify whatever. 
2018-02-13 15:46:25	ajshryoc	Okay, I'll check it out 
2018-02-14 21:35:45	ajshryoc	@ajshryoc shared a file: https://plm18.slack.com/files/U8M1VEVT3/F98NZUTNC/CSC495_Project_Todo_List (CSC495 Project Todo List) 
2018-02-14 21:35:45		@ajshryoc commented on @ajshryoc?s file https://plm18.slack.com/files/U8M1VEVT3/F98NZUTNC/CSC495_Project_Todo_List (CSC495 Project Todo List): Hey guys, I did a little design work on an approach I've thought of for implementing the two games based on some stuff we've talked about in class. I mainly just tried to break down the game object that were suggested we use in class in the context of a finite state machine. Let me know what you think and if you have suggestions/feedback. We could then write this up as GitHub issues. That way, we can assign things as tasks. 
2018-02-14 21:42:45	Jesse	thats a pretty solid writeup. I'll spend some more time looking over it later.  I think the most complex thing is going to be implementing rules and goals since they can vary  a lot from game to game. 
2018-02-14 21:44:58	ajshryoc	I agree. That along with what constitutes a valid move---especially with solitaire. 
2018-02-15 14:40:27	Jesse	hey guys, i'm gonna be late to class today. I've got a video call with the people i'll be interning with from 3:30 to 4:30. 
2018-02-16 00:07:50	ajshryoc	added an integration to this channel: https://plm18.slack.com/services/B9A0YJ9V1 (github) 
2018-02-16 00:12:00	ajshryoc	I've converted the list I wrote up yesterday into a few GitHub issues. Please feel free to take a look and modify if you see fit. With these we can more easily divide up tasks (or subtasks) and tag commits/branches with them. I also added the GitHub app to this channel, which will post when events happen on the repo. If it starts to get annoying, I can reduce the notifications or turn it off. Figured I'd give it a shot and see if it's useful for keeping everyone up to date on code changes 
2018-02-16 10:06:31	Jesse	I'll start working on this tomorrow. I'm dedicating today to English 331 and research. thanks for this Andrew. [:+1:1] 
2018-02-17 12:56:28	Jesse	I'm gonna be working on this project starting now. I'll try to document my work here. I'm willing to meet up at Hunt if you guys are interested, but it's not necessary. 
2018-02-17 13:04:31	ajshryoc	Sweet. I may work on this depending on how quickly I can do my networks homework today.  
2018-02-17 13:07:13	Jesse	Ok. I'm gonna be looking more into higher level design aspects rather than implementation. I'll let you know what I find. [:+1:1] 
2018-02-17 14:19:00	Jesse	I think I've worked out most of the ambiguous stuff. i can try to upload my notes but it is quite illegible, so ill have to meet with you guys some time to explain.
2018-02-17 14:19:00		Once I work out the rest of the thinking stuff, Ill try to lay out what needs to be done in the form of  a informal UML diagram. From there, I'm going to give out some tasks as far as implementation of this UML. 
2018-02-17 14:19:00		this is my goal for today.

2018-02-19 10:14:55	Jesse	I dont think I updated you guys on what I did in that commit. I implemented the basic structure and started on the solitaire UI. I left the rulebook and other game specific things unimplemented. I would also like to expand the basic structures functionality to things like flipping over a card or moving sets of cards from one pile to another pile. 
2018-02-19 17:12:34	ajshryoc	Yeah, added functionality like that would be great. I'm not sure how difficult it would be, but it would be cool if the Pile class was iterable so that you could use it in a for loop. If it too complicated to add that don't worry about it

2018-02-19 21:24:57	Jesse	I added functionality for piles giving one card or giving a set of cards. [:+1:1]

2018-02-19 21:56:00	Jesse	the UI for solitaire is starting to look good. 
2018-02-19 21:56:28	ajshryoc	Yeah, nice! 
2018-02-19 22:03:59	Jesse	I'm not gonna lie, the base code is a lil messy, so if theres any general features that you think needs to be in there just let me know and I can implement it. 
2018-02-19 22:04:46	Jesse	as for the UI, I'm making it so you guys just pass in a set of piles. and the index in the set of piles will determine which pile is positioned where. 
2018-02-19 22:05:46	Jesse	I also hardcoded the height of the board since we know that there will be no higher stack of cards than 13 (which is Ace-King) in solitaire 
2018-02-19 22:07:38	ajshryoc	That would be pretty sweet if we just have to pass in the piles. I think it looks pretty good. We can worry about code cleanup later too. 
2018-02-19 22:09:08	ajshryoc	I was able to get crazy eights working with just 1 player playing cards on the pile, so it looks like we're in a pretty good spot for this project 
2018-02-19 22:09:23	Jesse	dang really? thats pretty awesome 
2018-02-19 22:10:43	ajshryoc	It'll be a cool project once it's all working. The way we have it setup (with your cards.py objects) made it pretty straightforward to program 
2018-02-19 22:10:45	Jesse	can you tell me what the board would look like for crazy eight? is it just a pile for taking cards and a pile for laying cards? also displaying the hand to the player? 
2018-02-19 22:13:53	ajshryoc	@ajshryoc uploaded a file: https://plm18.slack.com/files/U8M1VEVT3/F9ATPNWBS/crazyeights.jpg (crazyeights.JPG) and commented: Here's what I've been using as a sort of debug UI.  So, there's the pile for taking cards, pile for playing cards, and the player's hand. I'm unsure how to handle the computer players since the number of card they hold is definitely relevant to the player. 
2018-02-19 22:14:54	ajshryoc	I think just listing the AI players and showing how many face down cards are in their hands on different lines would be good enough 
2018-02-19 22:16:20	ajshryoc	As a side note, I defined a Move as a Crazy Eights specific object (although it might be worth pulling out) that is defined by a Card, a "to" Pile, and a "from" Pile. It has a method called "make" that will remove the Card from "from" Pile and add it to "to" Pile. This kinda thing might be useful for solitaire too  (edited)
2018-02-19 22:17:59	Jesse	oh. I made a similar function in my Pile class (giveOneCard) 
2018-02-19 22:19:01	ajshryoc	No problem, that totally works. I'll adjust what I've got to match your code once I pull it in 
2018-02-19 22:19:20	Jesse	Would you guys be willing to meet up tomorrow so that we can clean up our code? / continue developing? 
2018-02-19 22:19:32	Jesse	I'm good all day except class time

2018-02-20 10:30:28	Jesse	Yeah. Would you be able to meet after class andrew? I don't think we need a lot of time. My plan was just to use an hour or two to clean up some of the code in the generic game structure/UI's and implement any functionality you guys think would be good for both games. 
2018-02-20 10:32:21	Jesse	If not, I could meet with andrew an hour before class and then after class with Joseph for an hour.

2018-02-20 13:05:32	Jesse	thats awesome!! but arent the red cards supposed to go on black cards and vice versa? 
2018-02-20 13:05:45	Jesse	its okay if we want to change it for the sake of project scope 
2018-02-20 13:05:53	Jesse	to be red on red 
2018-02-20 13:08:42	jwstanl3	The rules from Bicycle didn't have any restrictions on color. It just had to be consecutive. But, yea, normally you would alternate colors, and it would be pretty easy to switch the program to follow that. 
2018-02-20 13:09:15	jwstanl3	The game's really easy at the moment, so adding something like that would help it be more challenging.

2018-02-21 20:28:57	jwstanl3	I pushed some fixes to my solitaire code. Cards have to alternate in color now in the stacks. There were a few other bugs I fixed. I still haven't added a win state, or a loss state really, but it should be able to detect a win or loss, if the loss state doesn't have any moves left. I haven't been able to beat the game since adding the alternating colors, so I'm not sure if this is true or not.

2018-02-22 22:08:38	ajshryoc	Added what I have for crazy eights. I think the only major feature missing is the suit change when playing an 8. I also intend to clean up the code and little bit to get rid of redundancy.  (edited)

2018-02-24 12:28:32	Jesse	Do you guys understand python decorators? I haven't been able to reproduce a function that demonstrates the difference with/without the decorator. 
2018-02-25 20:28:31	ajshryoc	Sorry, intended to respond, then totally forgot about this. My understanding of python decorators is it's just another form of syntax for calling functions; however, it sort of ties two functions together and modifies the function being decorated. Here's an article I found that gives a good explanation on the subject: http://python-3-patterns-idioms-test.readthedocs.io/en/latest/PythonDecorators.html

2018-02-25 22:39:22	ajshryoc	Just pushed the finished version of Crazy Eights. It's kinda a mess, so I'll probably do some refactoring of it at some point. I also modified cards.py to print out the unicode symbol corresponding to the card's suit. I was curious about how to do it and it turned out to be really easy, so I added it. I think it makes it much easier to see the cards 
2018-02-25 22:41:04	Jesse	oh nice!!! let me know if theres anything youd like me to change.  
2018-02-26 13:50:38	Jesse	I played both crazy eights and solitaire and I haven't noticed any bugs. winning looks good as well. 
2018-02-26 13:52:31	Jesse	we may be able to polish a few things up but honestly, it doesn't matter too much because we'll be taking parts of our code out and re implementing stuff for the second submission. I think what we have is gold. If there's anything you guys want me to change, just let me know. 
2018-02-26 17:12:29	ajshryoc	Glad you liked it! I think they both play pretty well

2018-03-12 13:11:03	Jesse	Do you guys have the transcript of the 2 games? if not I can make them. 
2018-03-12 13:12:50	ajshryoc	I don't have a transcript. You should be able to use the tee command to output to a file and stdout 
2018-03-12 13:13:04	Jesse	I was just gonna use script 
2018-03-12 13:13:18	Jesse	it automatically outputs the log to a file

2018-03-16 10:06:54	Jesse	I'm gonna take a look now about what we can do to our project for submission 3. 
2018-03-16 10:13:12	Jesse	Nobody but me used cardsTest.py right? would you guys mind if I deleted that file? 
2018-03-16 10:17:46	Jesse	We may want to ask the professor about this... I worry our games are too different. 
2018-03-17 00:11:58	ajshryoc	You can delete cardsTest.py if no one is using it. I would probably make a new directory in the git repo called 'project3' or something so that we have a record of both of our submissions. As for the issues with the games, if you want to ask him, go ahead. I think we could make it work but I'm sure he could provide some insight. <--- Sorry typed this up about 14 hours ago and never hit send 
2018-03-19 14:19:24	Jesse	We got a 90% it seems on what we submitted for the project. He said he liked our nouns/verbs but was disappointed that we didn't make an FSM. He also linked "Derive Interfaces from Constraints of Data" as if its some reading on moodle or github. 
2018-03-19 14:19:57	Jesse	... I checked both, and I'm not sure what he's talking about 
2018-03-19 14:36:38	ajshryoc	I'm also unsure what he meant by that. Our design did get a shoutout in #proj2_mar1 though so that's pretty cool 
2018-03-19 14:38:04	Jesse	i didn't see that. that is pretty cool 
2018-03-19 14:38:44	ajshryoc	Also, just realized the section the he references is also in that Google doc with the feedback 
2018-03-19 15:03:59	jwstanl3	Even after looking at that section, I'm still not sure what he wants us to get from that. The lines he references are where the suits are printed in Crazy Eights to allow the user to select which suit to change to. I don't get how that could be changed. 
2018-03-19 16:30:23	ajshryoc	It could definitely be made better. I think the whole system, crazy eights especially, could benefit from state machines. I intended to cleanup some of that code, but I decided to just wait until this upcoming submission. I'll take a better look at the comments later 
2018-03-19 17:59:01	Jesse	I'm not sure I know how the system could be improved with FSMs. But if you know what you'd like to change, I could definitely help out with that. The issue I see with FSMs is that only crazy eights would use it... and it would just be wasted code for solitaire. 
2018-03-19 19:10:58	ajshryoc	I'm sure he'll provide more context tomorrow. I'll review their comments too and we can go from there 
2018-03-20 10:11:37	Jesse	Hey guys, I was checking out a few other peoples code, and i found one where they built the FSM setup stuff, and didn't call it anywhere in their code xD. I wonder if the graders caught it.

2018-03-28 20:46:28	Jesse	I get what you mean, and I tried coding that up last night, but I'm struggling with what should be classes vs methods vs variables, and how should all of these things be linked up together?   
2018-03-28 20:49:16	Jesse	I guess the obvious answer would be to have all states and transitions be their own classes... but it also doesn't make sense for them to be their own classes when they might only have one variable or one method... and if the method just says pass, it doesn't really make sense to even have that method... 
2018-03-28 20:50:07	Jesse	And so you take the approach of having strings be states and methods being transitions... which is exactly how our code is now.. 
2018-03-28 20:50:32	Jesse	That's where my confusion with this project is. 
2018-03-28 20:52:56	ajshryoc	Yes, you're right and I'm not 100% sure how this implementation would work either. But, a lot of that I think could be solved by how it's implemented. For example, the State class could have a default implementation of each of its methods that is just "pass", that way, if you don't need the method, you don't worry about it. 
2018-03-28 20:55:40	ajshryoc	I think that Start, Play, Goal, and Fail could each be subclasses of State. When, as an example, Crazy Eights goes to instantiate a Start state, it should just have to pass in a lambda body that sets up the game. So, it wouldn't even need to subclass a new Start state (although it could). I think that it would look something like this: 
2018-03-28 20:55:45	ajshryoc	`start = new StartState(onEntry=setupCrazyEights)` 
2018-03-28 20:56:46	ajshryoc	`game.fsm = new FSM(start=start, play=runGame, end=endGame)` 
2018-03-28 20:57:07	ajshryoc	Or something like that. I may be oversimplifying things but I think it's doable 
2018-03-28 21:01:18	Jesse	I'll give it another shot tonight and let you know how it ends up tomorrow 
2018-03-28 21:02:43	ajshryoc	Okay, I will take a look at it too 
2018-03-28 21:24:44	Jesse	@Jesse uploaded a file: https://plm18.slack.com/files/U8N7VJU30/F9Z06TD0X/fsm.py (fsm) 
2018-03-28 21:24:51	Jesse	does that look like a good start? 
2018-03-28 21:32:03	Jesse	I really like the idea of passing in lambda bodies to abstract functions... that solved some of my 'why' questions earlier.. but its still kinda confusin  
2018-03-28 21:32:17	ajshryoc	Yeah, I think so. For the lambdas you pass in, you should just be able to pass in a function that performs the 'move' operation  (edited)
2018-03-28 21:32:36	ajshryoc	But, yeah I agree it is a little confusing 
2018-03-28 21:59:24	Jesse	nevermind, this whole thing seems stupid again... its like we're just making 4 methods for the sake of calling the same methods we would have initially. We pass the functions into some abstract class which just calls those methods in the abstract class... why not just call the functions? 
2018-03-28 22:04:45	Jesse	This whole process isn't saving us any lines of code... and as far as run-time and memory goes, this is more inefficient than what we've coded. It's even more unreadable too since theres more files for future programmers to go through. 
2018-03-28 23:14:21	ajshryoc	I'm working through a test version of crazy eights using an FSM, so hopefully that will help clear things up (if it works) 
2018-04-02 16:59:46	Jesse	Would either of you be free tonight to work on the plm stuff? or at least be free to instruct me on how I can help with the plm stuff? (since I haven't been very helpful so far) 
2018-04-02 17:32:35	ajshryoc	I am not free tonight to meet, but I should be able to push a working version of Crazy Eights with the FSM. Hopefully that will clear things up on how to implement the games with an FSM. Do you have ideas on things to change other than re-implementing the games with an FSM? 
2018-04-02 17:53:32	Jesse	not really, but we also have a paper we have to write. If I cannot find any improvements to the code, I'll try to get started on that.

2018-04-02 18:49:50	ajshryoc	I committed what I have so far to the other branch. You're welcome to take a look at it and continue developing it if that interests you. My approach so far has been to shove as much of what we already had as possible into the FSM. When I get back later, I will probably start rebuilding some of the functions passed into the FSM from the ground up to get rid of any issues I am just completely overlooking from our first iteration  (edited)

I was originally going to just have two versions of Crazy Eights until I got the FSM one working and then copy that over into CrazyEights.py, but I like your separation of logic here. I think at the very least we could label the FSM specification as the "domain specific language" he's looking for especially now that it's separated. 
2018-04-02 20:17:52	ajshryoc	Like I said before, I'm going to try re-writing the game logic to make it better-suited to the FSM to hopefully get rid of the bugs 
2018-04-02 20:18:24	Jesse	ok. im makin some changes now so don't do anything big :P 
2018-04-02 20:19:16	ajshryoc	Okay, no problem. Anything specific you are looking at or I should avoid? 
2018-04-02 20:20:56	Jesse	im trying to have everything output to a log file. it's just annoying because of how python handles inheritance 
2018-04-02 20:29:47	Jesse	the stupidly annoying thing about the log file is that every object needs one, and I can't open the same file multiple times without problems I don't think. 
2018-04-02 20:35:00	Jesse	i just undid my changes. You're free to edit it 
2018-04-02 20:35:22	ajshryoc	I'm unfamiliar with logs in python. Is there a specific package for it that giving you trouble or just using file i/o? 
2018-04-02 20:35:46	Jesse	I tried both  
2018-04-02 20:37:07	Jesse	either way, it would make us have a ton of duplicated code if we tried to put it in there.  
2018-04-02 20:54:54	Jesse	im gonna try to implement the solitaire stuff like you have with the fsms 
2018-04-02 20:56:14	ajshryoc	Okay, how do you want to get the FSM code? I could merge to master or you could branch off of crazy-eights-fsm 
2018-04-02 20:57:07	Jesse	ill just branch off crazy-eights-fsm 
2018-04-02 21:59:48	Jesse	it doesn't look like the guards are being called. 
2018-04-02 21:59:50	Jesse	are they? 
2018-04-02 22:50:13	Jesse	theres some bugs in the solitaire fsm but its pretty much there. 
2018-04-02 23:14:14	Jesse	let me know if you guys are wanting to do the "bonus projects" that menzies just listed a couple hours ago. 
2018-04-02 23:51:15	ajshryoc	Yeah, they're being called for me. I accidentally was calling them in the state object declaration for awhile though because I had the syntax wrong 
2018-04-02 23:51:27	ajshryoc	I'll look more into the bonus projects tomorrow

2018-02-05 21:28:33	ajshryoc	I'm working on the annotations a litte. Just trying to add some more words to the game descriptions. Let me know what you guys think and feel free to add anything 
2018-02-06 19:31:23	ajshryoc	I made a couple small additions to the annotation. Mainly just for formatting/flow. Let me know what you guys think and add whatever else you think we need. If you guys think it's good, I can submit the doc 
2018-02-06 20:39:28	Jesse	ill take a look now. sorry i was distracted 
2018-02-06 20:44:36	Jesse	well dang. thats a lot more of an improvement than i was expecting. Nice work Andrew  
2018-02-06 20:45:22	jwstanl3	Everything looks good 
2018-02-06 20:47:21	Jesse	yeah I agree. 
2018-02-06 20:48:54	Jesse	would you like me to submit? 
2018-02-06 20:49:09	ajshryoc	Thanks, just took what we had before and made it flow a little better

2018-02-06 20:50:49	ajshryoc	Sweet 
2018-02-11 09:22:16	Jesse	Hey guys do either of you understand the homework? 
2018-02-11 11:38:18	ajshryoc	I have not taken a look at it so far. I just saw that Alex Phelps posted some tips in #homework that seemed helpful. Will probably get to the homework later today or tomorrow 
2018-02-11 11:49:28	Jesse	yeah. i gotcha 
2018-02-12 21:17:50	ajshryoc	Have you guys finished the homework? I think I've got it---it looks like it's behaving correctly, but I'm not sure what he wants exactly 
2018-02-13 10:43:30	Jesse	I submitted something but I don't think it's right at all. I just made the program look like it was doing something right and submittted it. 
2018-02-13 14:46:06	Jesse	I just pushed  a starter to our cardgame project in our github repo. check it out when ya get the chance. i was just sketching some things up so feel free to modify whatever. 
2018-02-13 15:46:25	ajshryoc	Okay, I'll check it out 
2018-02-14 21:35:45	ajshryoc	@ajshryoc shared a file: https://plm18.slack.com/files/U8M1VEVT3/F98NZUTNC/CSC495_Project_Todo_List (CSC495 Project Todo List) 
2018-02-14 21:35:45		@ajshryoc commented on @ajshryoc?s file https://plm18.slack.com/files/U8M1VEVT3/F98NZUTNC/CSC495_Project_Todo_List (CSC495 Project Todo List): Hey guys, I did a little design work on an approach I've thought of for implementing the two games based on some stuff we've talked about in class. I mainly just tried to break down the game object that were suggested we use in class in the context of a finite state machine. Let me know what you think and if you have suggestions/feedback. We could then write this up as GitHub issues. That way, we can assign things as tasks. 
2018-02-14 21:42:45	Jesse	thats a pretty solid writeup. I'll spend some more time looking over it later.  I think the most complex thing is going to be implementing rules and goals since they can vary  a lot from game to game. 
2018-02-14 21:44:58	ajshryoc	I agree. That along with what constitutes a valid move---especially with solitaire. 
2018-02-15 14:40:27	Jesse	hey guys, i'm gonna be late to class today. I've got a video call with the people i'll be interning with from 3:30 to 4:30. 
2018-02-16 00:07:50	ajshryoc	added an integration to this channel: https://plm18.slack.com/services/B9A0YJ9V1 (github) 
2018-02-16 00:12:00	ajshryoc	I've converted the list I wrote up yesterday into a few GitHub issues. Please feel free to take a look and modify if you see fit. With these we can more easily divide up tasks (or subtasks) and tag commits/branches with them. I also added the GitHub app to this channel, which will post when events happen on the repo. If it starts to get annoying, I can reduce the notifications or turn it off. Figured I'd give it a shot and see if it's useful for keeping everyone up to date on code changes 
2018-02-16 10:06:31	Jesse	I'll start working on this tomorrow. I'm dedicating today to English 331 and research. thanks for this Andrew. [:+1:1] 
2018-02-17 12:56:28	Jesse	I'm gonna be working on this project starting now. I'll try to document my work here. I'm willing to meet up at Hunt if you guys are interested, but it's not necessary. 
2018-02-17 13:04:31	ajshryoc	Sweet. I may work on this depending on how quickly I can do my networks homework today.  
2018-02-17 13:07:13	Jesse	Ok. I'm gonna be looking more into higher level design aspects rather than implementation. I'll let you know what I find. [:+1:1] 
2018-02-17 14:19:00	Jesse	I think I've worked out most of the ambiguous stuff. i can try to upload my notes but it is quite illegible, so ill have to meet with you guys some time to explain.
2018-02-17 14:19:00		Once I work out the rest of the thinking stuff, Ill try to lay out what needs to be done in the form of  a informal UML diagram. From there, I'm going to give out some tasks as far as implementation of this UML. 
2018-02-17 14:19:00		this is my goal for today.

2018-02-17 17:47:09	Jesse	Hey guys, I pushed my UML diagram. Tomorrow I'll handle some of the basic classes like hand, pile, deck and whatever. I also assigned myself to the UI task. 
2018-02-17 17:47:30	ajshryoc	Hey @jwstanl3, which one of the two games would you like to work on? 
2018-02-17 20:14:45	jwstanl3	I'll look into Solitaire. Sorry for taking so long to reply.

2018-02-19 10:14:55	Jesse	I dont think I updated you guys on what I did in that commit. I implemented the basic structure and started on the solitaire UI. I left the rulebook and other game specific things unimplemented. I would also like to expand the basic structures functionality to things like flipping over a card or moving sets of cards from one pile to another pile. 
2018-02-19 17:12:34	ajshryoc	Yeah, added functionality like that would be great. I'm not sure how difficult it would be, but it would be cool if the Pile class was iterable so that you could use it in a for loop. If it too complicated to add that don't worry about it

2018-02-19 21:24:57	Jesse	I added functionality for piles giving one card or giving a set of cards. [:+1:1]

2018-02-19 21:56:00	Jesse	the UI for solitaire is starting to look good. 
2018-02-19 21:56:28	ajshryoc	Yeah, nice! 
2018-02-19 22:03:59	Jesse	I'm not gonna lie, the base code is a lil messy, so if theres any general features that you think needs to be in there just let me know and I can implement it. 
2018-02-19 22:04:46	Jesse	as for the UI, I'm making it so you guys just pass in a set of piles. and the index in the set of piles will determine which pile is positioned where. 
2018-02-19 22:05:46	Jesse	I also hardcoded the height of the board since we know that there will be no higher stack of cards than 13 (which is Ace-King) in solitaire 
2018-02-19 22:07:38	ajshryoc	That would be pretty sweet if we just have to pass in the piles. I think it looks pretty good. We can worry about code cleanup later too. 
2018-02-19 22:09:08	ajshryoc	I was able to get crazy eights working with just 1 player playing cards on the pile, so it looks like we're in a pretty good spot for this project 
2018-02-19 22:09:23	Jesse	dang really? thats pretty awesome 
2018-02-19 22:10:43	ajshryoc	It'll be a cool project once it's all working. The way we have it setup (with your cards.py objects) made it pretty straightforward to program 
2018-02-19 22:10:45	Jesse	can you tell me what the board would look like for crazy eight? is it just a pile for taking cards and a pile for laying cards? also displaying the hand to the player? 
2018-02-19 22:13:53	ajshryoc	@ajshryoc uploaded a file: https://plm18.slack.com/files/U8M1VEVT3/F9ATPNWBS/crazyeights.jpg (crazyeights.JPG) and commented: Here's what I've been using as a sort of debug UI.  So, there's the pile for taking cards, pile for playing cards, and the player's hand. I'm unsure how to handle the computer players since the number of card they hold is definitely relevant to the player. 
2018-02-19 22:14:54	ajshryoc	I think just listing the AI players and showing how many face down cards are in their hands on different lines would be good enough 
2018-02-19 22:16:20	ajshryoc	As a side note, I defined a Move as a Crazy Eights specific object (although it might be worth pulling out) that is defined by a Card, a "to" Pile, and a "from" Pile. It has a method called "make" that will remove the Card from "from" Pile and add it to "to" Pile. This kinda thing might be useful for solitaire too  (edited)
2018-02-19 22:17:59	Jesse	oh. I made a similar function in my Pile class (giveOneCard) 
2018-02-19 22:19:01	ajshryoc	No problem, that totally works. I'll adjust what I've got to match your code once I pull it in 
2018-02-19 22:19:20	Jesse	Would you guys be willing to meet up tomorrow so that we can clean up our code? / continue developing? 
2018-02-19 22:19:32	Jesse	I'm good all day except class time

2018-02-20 10:30:28	Jesse	Yeah. Would you be able to meet after class andrew? I don't think we need a lot of time. My plan was just to use an hour or two to clean up some of the code in the generic game structure/UI's and implement any functionality you guys think would be good for both games. 
2018-02-20 10:32:21	Jesse	If not, I could meet with andrew an hour before class and then after class with Joseph for an hour. 
2018-02-20 11:36:11	ajshryoc	I could meet briefly right after class

2018-02-20 12:00:47	jwstanl3	I have the solitaire game pretty much working completely, but I changed some things in the cards and SolitaireUI files, so I'll wait until we meet to commit anything

2018-02-20 13:05:32	Jesse	thats awesome!! but arent the red cards supposed to go on black cards and vice versa? 
2018-02-20 13:05:45	Jesse	its okay if we want to change it for the sake of project scope 
2018-02-20 13:05:53	Jesse	to be red on red 
2018-02-20 13:08:42	jwstanl3	The rules from Bicycle didn't have any restrictions on color. It just had to be consecutive. But, yea, normally you would alternate colors, and it would be pretty easy to switch the program to follow that. 
2018-02-20 13:09:15	jwstanl3	The game's really easy at the moment, so adding something like that would help it be more challenging.

2018-02-21 20:28:57	jwstanl3	I pushed some fixes to my solitaire code. Cards have to alternate in color now in the stacks. There were a few other bugs I fixed. I still haven't added a win state, or a loss state really, but it should be able to detect a win or loss, if the loss state doesn't have any moves left. I haven't been able to beat the game since adding the alternating colors, so I'm not sure if this is true or not.

2018-02-23 10:52:41	Jesse	thanks! 
2018-02-24 12:28:32	Jesse	Do you guys understand python decorators? I haven't been able to reproduce a function that demonstrates the difference with/without the decorator. 
2018-02-25 20:28:31	ajshryoc	Sorry, intended to respond, then totally forgot about this. My understanding of python decorators is it's just another form of syntax for calling functions; however, it sort of ties two functions together and modifies the function being decorated. Here's an article I found that gives a good explanation on the subject: http://python-3-patterns-idioms-test.readthedocs.io/en/latest/PythonDecorators.html

2018-02-25 22:39:22	ajshryoc	Just pushed the finished version of Crazy Eights. It's kinda a mess, so I'll probably do some refactoring of it at some point. I also modified cards.py to print out the unicode symbol corresponding to the card's suit. I was curious about how to do it and it turned out to be really easy, so I added it. I think it makes it much easier to see the cards 
2018-02-25 22:41:04	Jesse	oh nice!!! let me know if theres anything youd like me to change.  
2018-02-26 13:50:38	Jesse	I played both crazy eights and solitaire and I haven't noticed any bugs. winning looks good as well. 
2018-02-26 13:52:31	Jesse	we may be able to polish a few things up but honestly, it doesn't matter too much because we'll be taking parts of our code out and re implementing stuff for the second submission. I think what we have is gold. If there's anything you guys want me to change, just let me know. 
2018-02-26 17:12:29	ajshryoc	Glad you liked it! I think they both play pretty well 
2018-03-12 13:07:36	Jesse	Hey guys, we need to figure out what we need to submit and submit it before class tomorrow. 
2018-03-12 13:11:03	Jesse	Do you guys have the transcript of the 2 games? if not I can make them. 
2018-03-12 13:12:50	ajshryoc	I don't have a transcript. You should be able to use the tee command to output to a file and stdout 
2018-03-12 13:13:04	Jesse	I was just gonna use script 
2018-03-12 13:13:18	Jesse	it automatically outputs the log to a file 
2018-03-12 13:13:31	ajshryoc	Yeah, whatever works

2018-03-16 10:06:54	Jesse	I'm gonna take a look now about what we can do to our project for submission 3. 
2018-03-16 10:13:12	Jesse	Nobody but me used cardsTest.py right? would you guys mind if I deleted that file? 
2018-03-16 10:17:46	Jesse	We may want to ask the professor about this... I worry our games are too different. 
2018-03-17 00:11:58	ajshryoc	You can delete cardsTest.py if no one is using it. I would probably make a new directory in the git repo called 'project3' or something so that we have a record of both of our submissions. As for the issues with the games, if you want to ask him, go ahead. I think we could make it work but I'm sure he could provide some insight. <--- Sorry typed this up about 14 hours ago and never hit send 
2018-03-19 14:19:24	Jesse	We got a 90% it seems on what we submitted for the project. He said he liked our nouns/verbs but was disappointed that we didn't make an FSM. He also linked "Derive Interfaces from Constraints of Data" as if its some reading on moodle or github. 
2018-03-19 14:19:57	Jesse	... I checked both, and I'm not sure what he's talking about 
2018-03-19 14:36:38	ajshryoc	I'm also unsure what he meant by that. Our design did get a shoutout in #proj2_mar1 though so that's pretty cool 
2018-03-19 14:38:04	Jesse	i didn't see that. that is pretty cool 
2018-03-19 14:38:44	ajshryoc	Also, just realized the section the he references is also in that Google doc with the feedback 
2018-03-19 15:03:59	jwstanl3	Even after looking at that section, I'm still not sure what he wants us to get from that. The lines he references are where the suits are printed in Crazy Eights to allow the user to select which suit to change to. I don't get how that could be changed. 
2018-03-19 16:30:23	ajshryoc	It could definitely be made better. I think the whole system, crazy eights especially, could benefit from state machines. I intended to cleanup some of that code, but I decided to just wait until this upcoming submission. I'll take a better look at the comments later 
2018-03-19 17:59:01	Jesse	I'm not sure I know how the system could be improved with FSMs. But if you know what you'd like to change, I could definitely help out with that. The issue I see with FSMs is that only crazy eights would use it... and it would just be wasted code for solitaire. 
2018-03-19 19:10:58	ajshryoc	I'm sure he'll provide more context tomorrow. I'll review their comments too and we can go from there 
2018-03-20 10:11:37	Jesse	Hey guys, I was checking out a few other peoples code, and i found one where they built the FSM setup stuff, and didn't call it anywhere in their code xD. I wonder if the graders caught it.

2018-03-28 20:46:28	Jesse	I get what you mean, and I tried coding that up last night, but I'm struggling with what should be classes vs methods vs variables, and how should all of these things be linked up together?   
2018-03-28 20:49:16	Jesse	I guess the obvious answer would be to have all states and transitions be their own classes... but it also doesn't make sense for them to be their own classes when they might only have one variable or one method... and if the method just says pass, it doesn't really make sense to even have that method... 
2018-03-28 20:50:07	Jesse	And so you take the approach of having strings be states and methods being transitions... which is exactly how our code is now.. 
2018-03-28 20:50:32	Jesse	That's where my confusion with this project is. 
2018-03-28 20:52:56	ajshryoc	Yes, you're right and I'm not 100% sure how this implementation would work either. But, a lot of that I think could be solved by how it's implemented. For example, the State class could have a default implementation of each of its methods that is just "pass", that way, if you don't need the method, you don't worry about it. 
2018-03-28 20:55:40	ajshryoc	I think that Start, Play, Goal, and Fail could each be subclasses of State. When, as an example, Crazy Eights goes to instantiate a Start state, it should just have to pass in a lambda body that sets up the game. So, it wouldn't even need to subclass a new Start state (although it could). I think that it would look something like this: 
2018-03-28 20:55:45	ajshryoc	`start = new StartState(onEntry=setupCrazyEights)` 
2018-03-28 20:56:46	ajshryoc	`game.fsm = new FSM(start=start, play=runGame, end=endGame)` 
2018-03-28 20:57:07	ajshryoc	Or something like that. I may be oversimplifying things but I think it's doable 
2018-03-28 21:01:18	Jesse	I'll give it another shot tonight and let you know how it ends up tomorrow 
2018-03-28 21:02:43	ajshryoc	Okay, I will take a look at it too 
2018-03-28 21:24:44	Jesse	@Jesse uploaded a file: https://plm18.slack.com/files/U8N7VJU30/F9Z06TD0X/fsm.py (fsm) 
2018-03-28 21:24:51	Jesse	does that look like a good start? 
2018-03-28 21:32:03	Jesse	I really like the idea of passing in lambda bodies to abstract functions... that solved some of my 'why' questions earlier.. but its still kinda confusin  
2018-03-28 21:32:17	ajshryoc	Yeah, I think so. For the lambdas you pass in, you should just be able to pass in a function that performs the 'move' operation  (edited)
2018-03-28 21:32:36	ajshryoc	But, yeah I agree it is a little confusing 
2018-03-28 21:59:24	Jesse	nevermind, this whole thing seems stupid again... its like we're just making 4 methods for the sake of calling the same methods we would have initially. We pass the functions into some abstract class which just calls those methods in the abstract class... why not just call the functions? 
2018-03-28 22:04:45	Jesse	This whole process isn't saving us any lines of code... and as far as run-time and memory goes, this is more inefficient than what we've coded. It's even more unreadable too since theres more files for future programmers to go through. 
2018-03-28 23:14:21	ajshryoc	I'm working through a test version of crazy eights using an FSM, so hopefully that will help clear things up (if it works) 
2018-04-02 16:59:46	Jesse	Would either of you be free tonight to work on the plm stuff? or at least be free to instruct me on how I can help with the plm stuff? (since I haven't been very helpful so far) 
2018-04-02 17:32:35	ajshryoc	I am not free tonight to meet, but I should be able to push a working version of Crazy Eights with the FSM. Hopefully that will clear things up on how to implement the games with an FSM. Do you have ideas on things to change other than re-implementing the games with an FSM? 
2018-04-02 17:53:32	Jesse	not really, but we also have a paper we have to write. If I cannot find any improvements to the code, I'll try to get started on that.

2018-04-02 18:49:50	ajshryoc	I committed what I have so far to the other branch. You're welcome to take a look at it and continue developing it if that interests you. My approach so far has been to shove as much of what we already had as possible into the FSM. When I get back later, I will probably start rebuilding some of the functions passed into the FSM from the ground up to get rid of any issues I am just completely overlooking from our first iteration  (edited)
2018-04-02 19:10:11	Jesse	I think I'm going to get all of the non-fsm stuff into the CrazyEights.py file so it can be a lil more organized.

2018-04-02 20:17:07	ajshryoc	I like that idea. I was originally going to just have two versions of Crazy Eights until I got the FSM one working and then copy that over into CrazyEights.py, but I like your separation of logic here. I think at the very least we could label the FSM specification as the "domain specific language" he's looking for especially now that it's separated. 
2018-04-02 20:17:52	ajshryoc	Like I said before, I'm going to try re-writing the game logic to make it better-suited to the FSM to hopefully get rid of the bugs

2018-04-02 20:20:56	Jesse	im trying to have everything output to a log file. it's just annoying because of how python handles inheritance 
2018-04-02 20:29:47	Jesse	the stupidly annoying thing about the log file is that every object needs one, and I can't open the same file multiple times without problems I don't think. 
2018-04-02 20:35:00	Jesse	i just undid my changes. You're free to edit it 
2018-04-02 20:35:22	ajshryoc	I'm unfamiliar with logs in python. Is there a specific package for it that giving you trouble or just using file i/o? 
2018-04-02 20:35:46	Jesse	I tried both  
2018-04-02 20:37:07	Jesse	either way, it would make us have a ton of duplicated code if we tried to put it in there.

2018-04-02 20:56:14	ajshryoc	Okay, how do you want to get the FSM code? I could merge to master or you could branch off of crazy-eights-fsm 
2018-04-02 20:57:07	Jesse	ill just branch off crazy-eights-fsm

2018-02-19 10:14:55	Jesse	I dont think I updated you guys on what I did in that commit. I implemented the basic structure and started on the solitaire UI. I left the rulebook and other game specific things unimplemented. I would also like to expand the basic structures functionality to things like flipping over a card or moving sets of cards from one pile to another pile. 
2018-02-19 17:12:34	ajshryoc	Yeah, added functionality like that would be great. I'm not sure how difficult it would be, but it would be cool if the Pile class was iterable so that you could use it in a for loop. If it too complicated to add that don't worry about it

2018-02-19 21:24:57	Jesse	I added functionality for piles giving one card or giving a set of cards. [:+1:1]

2018-02-19 21:56:00	Jesse	the UI for solitaire is starting to look good. 
2018-02-19 21:56:28	ajshryoc	Yeah, nice! 
2018-02-19 22:03:59	Jesse	I'm not gonna lie, the base code is a lil messy, so if theres any general features that you think needs to be in there just let me know and I can implement it. 
2018-02-19 22:04:46	Jesse	as for the UI, I'm making it so you guys just pass in a set of piles. and the index in the set of piles will determine which pile is positioned where. 
2018-02-19 22:05:46	Jesse	I also hardcoded the height of the board since we know that there will be no higher stack of cards than 13 (which is Ace-King) in solitaire 
2018-02-19 22:07:38	ajshryoc	That would be pretty sweet if we just have to pass in the piles. I think it looks pretty good. We can worry about code cleanup later too. 
2018-02-19 22:09:08	ajshryoc	I was able to get crazy eights working with just 1 player playing cards on the pile, so it looks like we're in a pretty good spot for this project 
2018-02-19 22:09:23	Jesse	dang really? thats pretty awesome 
2018-02-19 22:10:43	ajshryoc	It'll be a cool project once it's all working. The way we have it setup (with your cards.py objects) made it pretty straightforward to program 
2018-02-19 22:10:45	Jesse	can you tell me what the board would look like for crazy eight? is it just a pile for taking cards and a pile for laying cards? also displaying the hand to the player? 
2018-02-19 22:13:53	ajshryoc	@ajshryoc uploaded a file: https://plm18.slack.com/files/U8M1VEVT3/F9ATPNWBS/crazyeights.jpg (crazyeights.JPG) and commented: Here's what I've been using as a sort of debug UI.  So, there's the pile for taking cards, pile for playing cards, and the player's hand. I'm unsure how to handle the computer players since the number of card they hold is definitely relevant to the player. 
2018-02-19 22:14:54	ajshryoc	I think just listing the AI players and showing how many face down cards are in their hands on different lines would be good enough 
2018-02-19 22:16:20	ajshryoc	As a side note, I defined a Move as a Crazy Eights specific object (although it might be worth pulling out) that is defined by a Card, a "to" Pile, and a "from" Pile. It has a method called "make" that will remove the Card from "from" Pile and add it to "to" Pile. This kinda thing might be useful for solitaire too  (edited)
2018-02-19 22:17:59	Jesse	oh. I made a similar function in my Pile class (giveOneCard) 
2018-02-19 22:19:01	ajshryoc	No problem, that totally works. I'll adjust what I've got to match your code once I pull it in 
2018-02-19 22:19:20	Jesse	Would you guys be willing to meet up tomorrow so that we can clean up our code? / continue developing? 
2018-02-19 22:19:32	Jesse	I'm good all day except class time

2018-02-20 10:30:28	Jesse	Yeah. Would you be able to meet after class andrew? I don't think we need a lot of time. My plan was just to use an hour or two to clean up some of the code in the generic game structure/UI's and implement any functionality you guys think would be good for both games.

2018-02-20 13:05:32	Jesse	thats awesome!! but arent the red cards supposed to go on black cards and vice versa? 
2018-02-20 13:05:45	Jesse	its okay if we want to change it for the sake of project scope 
2018-02-20 13:05:53	Jesse	to be red on red 
2018-02-20 13:08:42	jwstanl3	The rules from Bicycle didn't have any restrictions on color. It just had to be consecutive. But, yea, normally you would alternate colors, and it would be pretty easy to switch the program to follow that. 
2018-02-20 13:09:15	jwstanl3	The game's really easy at the moment, so adding something like that would help it be more challenging.

2018-02-21 20:28:57	jwstanl3	I pushed some fixes to my solitaire code. Cards have to alternate in color now in the stacks. There were a few other bugs I fixed. I still haven't added a win state, or a loss state really, but it should be able to detect a win or loss, if the loss state doesn't have any moves left. I haven't been able to beat the game since adding the alternating colors, so I'm not sure if this is true or not.

2018-02-22 22:08:38	ajshryoc	Added what I have for crazy eights. I think the only major feature missing is the suit change when playing an 8. I also intend to clean up the code and little bit to get rid of redundancy.  (edited)
2018-02-22 22:12:02	Jesse	great!! I'll probably take a look some time this weekend

2018-02-24 12:28:32	Jesse	Do you guys understand python decorators? I haven't been able to reproduce a function that demonstrates the difference with/without the decorator. 
2018-02-25 20:28:31	ajshryoc	Sorry, intended to respond, then totally forgot about this. My understanding of python decorators is it's just another form of syntax for calling functions; however, it sort of ties two functions together and modifies the function being decorated. Here's an article I found that gives a good explanation on the subject: http://python-3-patterns-idioms-test.readthedocs.io/en/latest/PythonDecorators.html

2018-02-25 22:39:22	ajshryoc	Just pushed the finished version of Crazy Eights. It's kinda a mess, so I'll probably do some refactoring of it at some point. I also modified cards.py to print out the unicode symbol corresponding to the card's suit. I was curious about how to do it and it turned out to be really easy, so I added it. I think it makes it much easier to see the cards 
2018-02-25 22:41:04	Jesse	oh nice!!! let me know if theres anything youd like me to change.  
2018-02-26 13:50:38	Jesse	I played both crazy eights and solitaire and I haven't noticed any bugs. winning looks good as well. 
2018-02-26 13:52:31	Jesse	we may be able to polish a few things up but honestly, it doesn't matter too much because we'll be taking parts of our code out and re implementing stuff for the second submission. I think what we have is gold. If there's anything you guys want me to change, just let me know. 
2018-02-26 17:12:29	ajshryoc	Glad you liked it! I think they both play pretty well 
2018-03-12 13:07:36	Jesse	Hey guys, we need to figure out what we need to submit and submit it before class tomorrow. 
2018-03-12 13:11:03	Jesse	Do you guys have the transcript of the 2 games? if not I can make them. 
2018-03-12 13:12:50	ajshryoc	I don't have a transcript. You should be able to use the tee command to output to a file and stdout 
2018-03-12 13:13:04	Jesse	I was just gonna use script 
2018-03-12 13:13:18	Jesse	it automatically outputs the log to a file

2018-03-16 10:06:54	Jesse	I'm gonna take a look now about what we can do to our project for submission 3. 
2018-03-16 10:13:12	Jesse	Nobody but me used cardsTest.py right? would you guys mind if I deleted that file? 
2018-03-16 10:17:46	Jesse	We may want to ask the professor about this... I worry our games are too different. 
2018-03-17 00:11:58	ajshryoc	You can delete cardsTest.py if no one is using it. I would probably make a new directory in the git repo called 'project3' or something so that we have a record of both of our submissions. As for the issues with the games, if you want to ask him, go ahead. I think we could make it work but I'm sure he could provide some insight. <--- Sorry typed this up about 14 hours ago and never hit send 
2018-03-19 14:19:24	Jesse	We got a 90% it seems on what we submitted for the project. He said he liked our nouns/verbs but was disappointed that we didn't make an FSM. He also linked "Derive Interfaces from Constraints of Data" as if its some reading on moodle or github. 
2018-03-19 14:19:57	Jesse	... I checked both, and I'm not sure what he's talking about 
2018-03-19 14:36:38	ajshryoc	I'm also unsure what he meant by that. Our design did get a shoutout in #proj2_mar1 though so that's pretty cool 
2018-03-19 14:38:04	Jesse	i didn't see that. that is pretty cool 
2018-03-19 14:38:44	ajshryoc	Also, just realized the section the he references is also in that Google doc with the feedback 
2018-03-19 15:03:59	jwstanl3	Even after looking at that section, I'm still not sure what he wants us to get from that. The lines he references are where the suits are printed in Crazy Eights to allow the user to select which suit to change to. I don't get how that could be changed. 
2018-03-19 16:30:23	ajshryoc	It could definitely be made better. I think the whole system, crazy eights especially, could benefit from state machines. I intended to cleanup some of that code, but I decided to just wait until this upcoming submission. I'll take a better look at the comments later 
2018-03-19 17:59:01	Jesse	I'm not sure I know how the system could be improved with FSMs. But if you know what you'd like to change, I could definitely help out with that. The issue I see with FSMs is that only crazy eights would use it... and it would just be wasted code for solitaire. 
2018-03-19 19:10:58	ajshryoc	I'm sure he'll provide more context tomorrow. I'll review their comments too and we can go from there 
2018-03-20 10:11:37	Jesse	Hey guys, I was checking out a few other peoples code, and i found one where they built the FSM setup stuff, and didn't call it anywhere in their code xD. I wonder if the graders caught it.

2018-03-28 20:46:28	Jesse	I get what you mean, and I tried coding that up last night, but I'm struggling with what should be classes vs methods vs variables, and how should all of these things be linked up together?   
2018-03-28 20:49:16	Jesse	I guess the obvious answer would be to have all states and transitions be their own classes... but it also doesn't make sense for them to be their own classes when they might only have one variable or one method... and if the method just says pass, it doesn't really make sense to even have that method... 
2018-03-28 20:50:07	Jesse	And so you take the approach of having strings be states and methods being transitions... which is exactly how our code is now.. 
2018-03-28 20:50:32	Jesse	That's where my confusion with this project is. 
2018-03-28 20:52:56	ajshryoc	Yes, you're right and I'm not 100% sure how this implementation would work either. But, a lot of that I think could be solved by how it's implemented. For example, the State class could have a default implementation of each of its methods that is just "pass", that way, if you don't need the method, you don't worry about it. 
2018-03-28 20:55:40	ajshryoc	I think that Start, Play, Goal, and Fail could each be subclasses of State. When, as an example, Crazy Eights goes to instantiate a Start state, it should just have to pass in a lambda body that sets up the game. So, it wouldn't even need to subclass a new Start state (although it could). I think that it would look something like this: 
2018-03-28 20:55:45	ajshryoc	`start = new StartState(onEntry=setupCrazyEights)` 
2018-03-28 20:56:46	ajshryoc	`game.fsm = new FSM(start=start, play=runGame, end=endGame)` 
2018-03-28 20:57:07	ajshryoc	Or something like that. I may be oversimplifying things but I think it's doable 
2018-03-28 21:01:18	Jesse	I'll give it another shot tonight and let you know how it ends up tomorrow 
2018-03-28 21:02:43	ajshryoc	Okay, I will take a look at it too 
2018-03-28 21:24:44	Jesse	@Jesse uploaded a file: https://plm18.slack.com/files/U8N7VJU30/F9Z06TD0X/fsm.py (fsm) 
2018-03-28 21:24:51	Jesse	does that look like a good start? 
2018-03-28 21:32:03	Jesse	I really like the idea of passing in lambda bodies to abstract functions... that solved some of my 'why' questions earlier.. but its still kinda confusin  
2018-03-28 21:32:17	ajshryoc	Yeah, I think so. For the lambdas you pass in, you should just be able to pass in a function that performs the 'move' operation  (edited)
2018-03-28 21:32:36	ajshryoc	But, yeah I agree it is a little confusing 
2018-03-28 21:59:24	Jesse	nevermind, this whole thing seems stupid again... its like we're just making 4 methods for the sake of calling the same methods we would have initially. We pass the functions into some abstract class which just calls those methods in the abstract class... why not just call the functions? 
2018-03-28 22:04:45	Jesse	This whole process isn't saving us any lines of code... and as far as run-time and memory goes, this is more inefficient than what we've coded. It's even more unreadable too since theres more files for future programmers to go through. 
2018-03-28 23:14:21	ajshryoc	I'm working through a test version of crazy eights using an FSM, so hopefully that will help clear things up (if it works) 
2018-04-02 16:59:46	Jesse	Would either of you be free tonight to work on the plm stuff? or at least be free to instruct me on how I can help with the plm stuff? (since I haven't been very helpful so far) 
2018-04-02 17:32:35	ajshryoc	I am not free tonight to meet, but I should be able to push a working version of Crazy Eights with the FSM. Hopefully that will clear things up on how to implement the games with an FSM. Do you have ideas on things to change other than re-implementing the games with an FSM? 
2018-04-02 17:53:32	Jesse	not really, but we also have a paper we have to write. If I cannot find any improvements to the code, I'll try to get started on that.

2018-04-02 18:49:50	ajshryoc	I committed what I have so far to the other branch. You're welcome to take a look at it and continue developing it if that interests you. My approach so far has been to shove as much of what we already had as possible into the FSM. When I get back later, I will probably start rebuilding some of the functions passed into the FSM from the ground up to get rid of any issues I am just completely overlooking from our first iteration  (edited)
2018-04-02 19:10:11	Jesse	I think I'm going to get all of the non-fsm stuff into the CrazyEights.py file so it can be a lil more organized.

2018-04-02 20:17:07	ajshryoc	I like that idea. I was originally going to just have two versions of Crazy Eights until I got the FSM one working and then copy that over into CrazyEights.py, but I like your separation of logic here. I think at the very least we could label the FSM specification as the "domain specific language" he's looking for especially now that it's separated. 
2018-04-02 20:17:52	ajshryoc	Like I said before, I'm going to try re-writing the game logic to make it better-suited to the FSM to hopefully get rid of the bugs 
2018-04-02 20:18:24	Jesse	ok. im makin some changes now so don't do anything big :P 
2018-04-02 20:19:16	ajshryoc	Okay, no problem. Anything specific you are looking at or I should avoid? 
2018-04-02 20:20:56	Jesse	im trying to have everything output to a log file. it's just annoying because of how python handles inheritance 
2018-04-02 20:29:47	Jesse	the stupidly annoying thing about the log file is that every object needs one, and I can't open the same file multiple times without problems I don't think. 
2018-04-02 20:35:00	Jesse	i just undid my changes. You're free to edit it 
2018-04-02 20:35:22	ajshryoc	I'm unfamiliar with logs in python. Is there a specific package for it that giving you trouble or just using file i/o? 
2018-04-02 20:35:46	Jesse	I tried both  
2018-04-02 20:37:07	Jesse	either way, it would make us have a ton of duplicated code if we tried to put it in there.  
2018-04-02 20:54:54	Jesse	im gonna try to implement the solitaire stuff like you have with the fsms 
2018-04-02 20:56:14	ajshryoc	Okay, how do you want to get the FSM code? I could merge to master or you could branch off of crazy-eights-fsm 
2018-04-02 20:57:07	Jesse	ill just branch off crazy-eights-fsm 
2018-04-02 21:59:48	Jesse	it doesn't look like the guards are being called. 
2018-04-02 21:59:50	Jesse	are they? 
2018-04-02 22:50:13	Jesse	theres some bugs in the solitaire fsm but its pretty much there. 
2018-04-02 23:14:14	Jesse	let me know if you guys are wanting to do the "bonus projects" that menzies just listed a couple hours ago. 
2018-04-02 23:51:15	ajshryoc	Yeah, they're being called for me. I accidentally was calling them in the state object declaration for awhile though because I had the syntax wrong 
2018-04-02 23:51:27	ajshryoc	I'll look more into the bonus projects tomorrow

2018-04-05 14:53:48	Jesse	yeah. if ya want you can come any time earlier though. I'm even here now, so it's really up to you. I'll just be working on ENG 331 until you decide to come over. I'm in Lakeview 104.  
2018-04-05 15:09:46	ajshryoc	I'm in the middle of laundry now so I will head over around 4 
2018-04-05 15:09:56	Jesse	sounds good 
2018-04-05 15:58:09	jwstanl3	I should be over there around 4:30 
2018-04-05 16:00:06	Jesse	sounds good! 
2018-04-05 16:01:12	ajshryoc	I'm about to leave so I'll be there in a few 
2018-04-05 16:01:28	Jesse	ok. 
2018-04-05 18:03:08		getting channel history...
2018-02-19 21:56:28	ajshryoc	Yeah, nice! 
2018-02-19 22:03:59	Jesse	I'm not gonna lie, the base code is a lil messy, so if theres any general features that you think needs to be in there just let me know and I can implement it. 
2018-02-19 22:04:46	Jesse	as for the UI, I'm making it so you guys just pass in a set of piles. and the index in the set of piles will determine which pile is positioned where. 
2018-02-19 22:05:46	Jesse	I also hardcoded the height of the board since we know that there will be no higher stack of cards than 13 (which is Ace-King) in solitaire 
2018-02-19 22:07:38	ajshryoc	That would be pretty sweet if we just have to pass in the piles. I think it looks pretty good. We can worry about code cleanup later too. 
2018-02-19 22:09:08	ajshryoc	I was able to get crazy eights working with just 1 player playing cards on the pile, so it looks like we're in a pretty good spot for this project 
2018-02-19 22:09:23	Jesse	dang really? thats pretty awesome 
2018-02-19 22:10:43	ajshryoc	It'll be a cool project once it's all working. The way we have it setup (with your cards.py objects) made it pretty straightforward to program 
2018-02-19 22:10:45	Jesse	can you tell me what the board would look like for crazy eight? is it just a pile for taking cards and a pile for laying cards? also displaying the hand to the player? 
2018-02-19 22:13:53	ajshryoc	@ajshryoc uploaded a file: https://plm18.slack.com/files/U8M1VEVT3/F9ATPNWBS/crazyeights.jpg (crazyeights.JPG) and commented: Here's what I've been using as a sort of debug UI.  So, there's the pile for taking cards, pile for playing cards, and the player's hand. I'm unsure how to handle the computer players since the number of card they hold is definitely relevant to the player. 
2018-02-19 22:14:54	ajshryoc	I think just listing the AI players and showing how many face down cards are in their hands on different lines would be good enough 
2018-02-19 22:16:20	ajshryoc	As a side note, I defined a Move as a Crazy Eights specific object (although it might be worth pulling out) that is defined by a Card, a "to" Pile, and a "from" Pile. It has a method called "make" that will remove the Card from "from" Pile and add it to "to" Pile. This kinda thing might be useful for solitaire too  (edited)
2018-02-19 22:17:59	Jesse	oh. I made a similar function in my Pile class (giveOneCard) 
2018-02-19 22:19:01	ajshryoc	No problem, that totally works. I'll adjust what I've got to match your code once I pull it in 
2018-02-19 22:19:20	Jesse	Would you guys be willing to meet up tomorrow so that we can clean up our code? / continue developing? 
2018-02-19 22:19:32	Jesse	I'm good all day except class time

2018-02-20 10:32:21	Jesse	If not, I could meet with andrew an hour before class and then after class with Joseph for an hour. 
2018-02-20 11:36:11	ajshryoc	I could meet briefly right after class 
2018-02-20 11:36:34	Jesse	cool! 
2018-02-20 12:00:47	jwstanl3	I have the solitaire game pretty much working completely, but I changed some things in the cards and SolitaireUI files, so I'll wait until we meet to commit anything 
2018-02-20 12:03:24	jwstanl3	@jwstanl3 uploaded a file: https://plm18.slack.com/files/U8N1B358V/F9B8MRFL0/solitaire.gif (Solitaire GIF) and commented: Here's a GIF of the game.  The only thing I haven't implemented is win and loss states. 
2018-02-20 13:05:32	Jesse	thats awesome!! but arent the red cards supposed to go on black cards and vice versa? 
2018-02-20 13:05:45	Jesse	its okay if we want to change it for the sake of project scope 
2018-02-20 13:05:53	Jesse	to be red on red 
2018-02-20 13:08:42	jwstanl3	The rules from Bicycle didn't have any restrictions on color. It just had to be consecutive. But, yea, normally you would alternate colors, and it would be pretty easy to switch the program to follow that. 
2018-02-20 13:09:15	jwstanl3	The game's really easy at the moment, so adding something like that would help it be more challenging.

2018-02-21 20:28:57	jwstanl3	I pushed some fixes to my solitaire code. Cards have to alternate in color now in the stacks. There were a few other bugs I fixed. I still haven't added a win state, or a loss state really, but it should be able to detect a win or loss, if the loss state doesn't have any moves left. I haven't been able to beat the game since adding the alternating colors, so I'm not sure if this is true or not.

2018-02-22 22:08:38	ajshryoc	Added what I have for crazy eights. I think the only major feature missing is the suit change when playing an 8. I also intend to clean up the code and little bit to get rid of redundancy.  (edited)

2018-02-24 12:28:32	Jesse	Do you guys understand python decorators? I haven't been able to reproduce a function that demonstrates the difference with/without the decorator. 
2018-02-25 20:28:31	ajshryoc	Sorry, intended to respond, then totally forgot about this. My understanding of python decorators is it's just another form of syntax for calling functions; however, it sort of ties two functions together and modifies the function being decorated. Here's an article I found that gives a good explanation on the subject: http://python-3-patterns-idioms-test.readthedocs.io/en/latest/PythonDecorators.html

2018-02-25 22:39:22	ajshryoc	Just pushed the finished version of Crazy Eights. It's kinda a mess, so I'll probably do some refactoring of it at some point. I also modified cards.py to print out the unicode symbol corresponding to the card's suit. I was curious about how to do it and it turned out to be really easy, so I added it. I think it makes it much easier to see the cards 
2018-02-25 22:41:04	Jesse	oh nice!!! let me know if theres anything youd like me to change.  
2018-02-26 13:50:38	Jesse	I played both crazy eights and solitaire and I haven't noticed any bugs. winning looks good as well. 
2018-02-26 13:52:31	Jesse	we may be able to polish a few things up but honestly, it doesn't matter too much because we'll be taking parts of our code out and re implementing stuff for the second submission. I think what we have is gold. If there's anything you guys want me to change, just let me know. 
2018-02-26 17:12:29	ajshryoc	Glad you liked it! I think they both play pretty well 
2018-03-12 13:07:36	Jesse	Hey guys, we need to figure out what we need to submit and submit it before class tomorrow. 
2018-03-12 13:11:03	Jesse	Do you guys have the transcript of the 2 games? if not I can make them. 
2018-03-12 13:12:50	ajshryoc	I don't have a transcript. You should be able to use the tee command to output to a file and stdout 
2018-03-12 13:13:04	Jesse	I was just gonna use script 
2018-03-12 13:13:18	Jesse	it automatically outputs the log to a file

2018-03-16 10:06:54	Jesse	I'm gonna take a look now about what we can do to our project for submission 3. 
2018-03-16 10:13:12	Jesse	Nobody but me used cardsTest.py right? would you guys mind if I deleted that file? 
2018-03-16 10:17:46	Jesse	We may want to ask the professor about this... I worry our games are too different. 
2018-03-17 00:11:58	ajshryoc	You can delete cardsTest.py if no one is using it. I would probably make a new directory in the git repo called 'project3' or something so that we have a record of both of our submissions. As for the issues with the games, if you want to ask him, go ahead. I think we could make it work but I'm sure he could provide some insight. <--- Sorry typed this up about 14 hours ago and never hit send 
2018-03-19 14:19:24	Jesse	We got a 90% it seems on what we submitted for the project. He said he liked our nouns/verbs but was disappointed that we didn't make an FSM. He also linked "Derive Interfaces from Constraints of Data" as if its some reading on moodle or github. 
2018-03-19 14:19:57	Jesse	... I checked both, and I'm not sure what he's talking about 
2018-03-19 14:36:38	ajshryoc	I'm also unsure what he meant by that. Our design did get a shoutout in #proj2_mar1 though so that's pretty cool 
2018-03-19 14:38:04	Jesse	i didn't see that. that is pretty cool 
2018-03-19 14:38:44	ajshryoc	Also, just realized the section the he references is also in that Google doc with the feedback 
2018-03-19 15:03:59	jwstanl3	Even after looking at that section, I'm still not sure what he wants us to get from that. The lines he references are where the suits are printed in Crazy Eights to allow the user to select which suit to change to. I don't get how that could be changed. 
2018-03-19 16:30:23	ajshryoc	It could definitely be made better. I think the whole system, crazy eights especially, could benefit from state machines. I intended to cleanup some of that code, but I decided to just wait until this upcoming submission. I'll take a better look at the comments later 
2018-03-19 17:59:01	Jesse	I'm not sure I know how the system could be improved with FSMs. But if you know what you'd like to change, I could definitely help out with that. The issue I see with FSMs is that only crazy eights would use it... and it would just be wasted code for solitaire. 
2018-03-19 19:10:58	ajshryoc	I'm sure he'll provide more context tomorrow. I'll review their comments too and we can go from there 
2018-03-20 10:11:37	Jesse	Hey guys, I was checking out a few other peoples code, and i found one where they built the FSM setup stuff, and didn't call it anywhere in their code xD. I wonder if the graders caught it.

2018-03-28 20:46:28	Jesse	I get what you mean, and I tried coding that up last night, but I'm struggling with what should be classes vs methods vs variables, and how should all of these things be linked up together?   
2018-03-28 20:49:16	Jesse	I guess the obvious answer would be to have all states and transitions be their own classes... but it also doesn't make sense for them to be their own classes when they might only have one variable or one method... and if the method just says pass, it doesn't really make sense to even have that method... 
2018-03-28 20:50:07	Jesse	And so you take the approach of having strings be states and methods being transitions... which is exactly how our code is now.. 
2018-03-28 20:50:32	Jesse	That's where my confusion with this project is. 
2018-03-28 20:52:56	ajshryoc	Yes, you're right and I'm not 100% sure how this implementation would work either. But, a lot of that I think could be solved by how it's implemented. For example, the State class could have a default implementation of each of its methods that is just "pass", that way, if you don't need the method, you don't worry about it. 
2018-03-28 20:55:40	ajshryoc	I think that Start, Play, Goal, and Fail could each be subclasses of State. When, as an example, Crazy Eights goes to instantiate a Start state, it should just have to pass in a lambda body that sets up the game. So, it wouldn't even need to subclass a new Start state (although it could). I think that it would look something like this: 
2018-03-28 20:55:45	ajshryoc	`start = new StartState(onEntry=setupCrazyEights)` 
2018-03-28 20:56:46	ajshryoc	`game.fsm = new FSM(start=start, play=runGame, end=endGame)` 
2018-03-28 20:57:07	ajshryoc	Or something like that. I may be oversimplifying things but I think it's doable 
2018-03-28 21:01:18	Jesse	I'll give it another shot tonight and let you know how it ends up tomorrow 
2018-03-28 21:02:43	ajshryoc	Okay, I will take a look at it too 
2018-03-28 21:24:44	Jesse	@Jesse uploaded a file: https://plm18.slack.com/files/U8N7VJU30/F9Z06TD0X/fsm.py (fsm) 
2018-03-28 21:24:51	Jesse	does that look like a good start? 
2018-03-28 21:32:03	Jesse	I really like the idea of passing in lambda bodies to abstract functions... that solved some of my 'why' questions earlier.. but its still kinda confusin  
2018-03-28 21:32:17	ajshryoc	Yeah, I think so. For the lambdas you pass in, you should just be able to pass in a function that performs the 'move' operation  (edited)
2018-03-28 21:32:36	ajshryoc	But, yeah I agree it is a little confusing 
2018-03-28 21:59:24	Jesse	nevermind, this whole thing seems stupid again... its like we're just making 4 methods for the sake of calling the same methods we would have initially. We pass the functions into some abstract class which just calls those methods in the abstract class... why not just call the functions? 
2018-03-28 22:04:45	Jesse	This whole process isn't saving us any lines of code... and as far as run-time and memory goes, this is more inefficient than what we've coded. It's even more unreadable too since theres more files for future programmers to go through. 
2018-03-28 23:14:21	ajshryoc	I'm working through a test version of crazy eights using an FSM, so hopefully that will help clear things up (if it works) 
2018-04-02 16:59:46	Jesse	Would either of you be free tonight to work on the plm stuff? or at least be free to instruct me on how I can help with the plm stuff? (since I haven't been very helpful so far) 
2018-04-02 17:32:35	ajshryoc	I am not free tonight to meet, but I should be able to push a working version of Crazy Eights with the FSM. Hopefully that will clear things up on how to implement the games with an FSM. Do you have ideas on things to change other than re-implementing the games with an FSM? 
2018-04-02 17:53:32	Jesse	not really, but we also have a paper we have to write. If I cannot find any improvements to the code, I'll try to get started on that.

2018-04-02 18:49:50	ajshryoc	I committed what I have so far to the other branch. You're welcome to take a look at it and continue developing it if that interests you. My approach so far has been to shove as much of what we already had as possible into the FSM. When I get back later, I will probably start rebuilding some of the functions passed into the FSM from the ground up to get rid of any issues I am just completely overlooking from our first iteration  (edited)
2018-04-02 19:10:11	Jesse	I think I'm going to get all of the non-fsm stuff into the CrazyEights.py file so it can be a lil more organized.

2018-04-02 20:17:07	ajshryoc	I like that idea. I was originally going to just have two versions of Crazy Eights until I got the FSM one working and then copy that over into CrazyEights.py, but I like your separation of logic here. I think at the very least we could label the FSM specification as the "domain specific language" he's looking for especially now that it's separated. 
2018-04-02 20:17:52	ajshryoc	Like I said before, I'm going to try re-writing the game logic to make it better-suited to the FSM to hopefully get rid of the bugs 
2018-04-02 20:18:24	Jesse	ok. im makin some changes now so don't do anything big :P 
2018-04-02 20:19:16	ajshryoc	Okay, no problem. Anything specific you are looking at or I should avoid? 
2018-04-02 20:20:56	Jesse	im trying to have everything output to a log file. it's just annoying because of how python handles inheritance 
2018-04-02 20:29:47	Jesse	the stupidly annoying thing about the log file is that every object needs one, and I can't open the same file multiple times without problems I don't think. 
2018-04-02 20:35:00	Jesse	i just undid my changes. You're free to edit it 
2018-04-02 20:35:22	ajshryoc	I'm unfamiliar with logs in python. Is there a specific package for it that giving you trouble or just using file i/o? 
2018-04-02 20:35:46	Jesse	I tried both  
2018-04-02 20:37:07	Jesse	either way, it would make us have a ton of duplicated code if we tried to put it in there.  
2018-04-02 20:54:54	Jesse	im gonna try to implement the solitaire stuff like you have with the fsms 
2018-04-02 20:56:14	ajshryoc	Okay, how do you want to get the FSM code? I could merge to master or you could branch off of crazy-eights-fsm 
2018-04-02 20:57:07	Jesse	ill just branch off crazy-eights-fsm 
2018-04-02 21:59:48	Jesse	it doesn't look like the guards are being called. 
2018-04-02 21:59:50	Jesse	are they? 
2018-04-02 22:50:13	Jesse	theres some bugs in the solitaire fsm but its pretty much there. 
2018-04-02 23:14:14	Jesse	let me know if you guys are wanting to do the "bonus projects" that menzies just listed a couple hours ago. 
2018-04-02 23:51:15	ajshryoc	Yeah, they're being called for me. I accidentally was calling them in the state object declaration for awhile though because I had the syntax wrong 
2018-04-02 23:51:27	ajshryoc	I'll look more into the bonus projects tomorrow

2018-02-19 22:19:20	Jesse	Would you guys be willing to meet up tomorrow so that we can clean up our code? / continue developing? 
2018-02-19 22:19:32	Jesse	I'm good all day except class time 
2018-02-19 22:20:10	ajshryoc	I'm good from around 1:30 to class time 
2018-02-19 22:24:03	Jesse	okay. I'd be down to meet then.

2018-02-20 07:46:29	jwstanl3	Would you guys be able to meet after class? I have a class from 1:30-2:45 and then I tutor from 3-4 
2018-02-20 10:30:28	Jesse	Yeah. Would you be able to meet after class andrew? I don't think we need a lot of time. My plan was just to use an hour or two to clean up some of the code in the generic game structure/UI's and implement any functionality you guys think would be good for both games. 
2018-02-20 10:32:21	Jesse	If not, I could meet with andrew an hour before class and then after class with Joseph for an hour. 
2018-02-20 11:36:11	ajshryoc	I could meet briefly right after class 
2018-02-20 11:36:34	Jesse	cool! 
2018-02-20 12:00:47	jwstanl3	I have the solitaire game pretty much working completely, but I changed some things in the cards and SolitaireUI files, so I'll wait until we meet to commit anything 
2018-02-20 12:03:24	jwstanl3	@jwstanl3 uploaded a file: https://plm18.slack.com/files/U8N1B358V/F9B8MRFL0/solitaire.gif (Solitaire GIF) and commented: Here's a GIF of the game.  The only thing I haven't implemented is win and loss states. 
2018-02-20 13:05:32	Jesse	thats awesome!! but arent the red cards supposed to go on black cards and vice versa? 
2018-02-20 13:05:45	Jesse	its okay if we want to change it for the sake of project scope 
2018-02-20 13:05:53	Jesse	to be red on red 
2018-02-20 13:08:42	jwstanl3	The rules from Bicycle didn't have any restrictions on color. It just had to be consecutive. But, yea, normally you would alternate colors, and it would be pretty easy to switch the program to follow that. 
2018-02-20 13:09:15	jwstanl3	The game's really easy at the moment, so adding something like that would help it be more challenging.

2018-02-21 20:28:57	jwstanl3	I pushed some fixes to my solitaire code. Cards have to alternate in color now in the stacks. There were a few other bugs I fixed. I still haven't added a win state, or a loss state really, but it should be able to detect a win or loss, if the loss state doesn't have any moves left. I haven't been able to beat the game since adding the alternating colors, so I'm not sure if this is true or not.

2018-02-22 22:08:38	ajshryoc	Added what I have for crazy eights. I think the only major feature missing is the suit change when playing an 8. I also intend to clean up the code and little bit to get rid of redundancy.  (edited)
2018-02-22 22:12:02	Jesse	great!! I'll probably take a look some time this weekend 
2018-02-23 10:48:02	Jesse	do you guys know where Menzies notes on lisp are? I cant find them

2018-02-23 10:52:41	Jesse	thanks! 
2018-02-24 12:28:32	Jesse	Do you guys understand python decorators? I haven't been able to reproduce a function that demonstrates the difference with/without the decorator. 
2018-02-25 20:28:31	ajshryoc	Sorry, intended to respond, then totally forgot about this. My understanding of python decorators is it's just another form of syntax for calling functions; however, it sort of ties two functions together and modifies the function being decorated. Here's an article I found that gives a good explanation on the subject: http://python-3-patterns-idioms-test.readthedocs.io/en/latest/PythonDecorators.html

2018-02-25 22:39:22	ajshryoc	Just pushed the finished version of Crazy Eights. It's kinda a mess, so I'll probably do some refactoring of it at some point. I also modified cards.py to print out the unicode symbol corresponding to the card's suit. I was curious about how to do it and it turned out to be really easy, so I added it. I think it makes it much easier to see the cards 
2018-02-25 22:41:04	Jesse	oh nice!!! let me know if theres anything youd like me to change.  
2018-02-26 13:50:38	Jesse	I played both crazy eights and solitaire and I haven't noticed any bugs. winning looks good as well. 
2018-02-26 13:52:31	Jesse	we may be able to polish a few things up but honestly, it doesn't matter too much because we'll be taking parts of our code out and re implementing stuff for the second submission. I think what we have is gold. If there's anything you guys want me to change, just let me know. 
2018-02-26 17:12:29	ajshryoc	Glad you liked it! I think they both play pretty well 
2018-03-12 13:07:36	Jesse	Hey guys, we need to figure out what we need to submit and submit it before class tomorrow. 
2018-03-12 13:11:03	Jesse	Do you guys have the transcript of the 2 games? if not I can make them. 
2018-03-12 13:12:50	ajshryoc	I don't have a transcript. You should be able to use the tee command to output to a file and stdout 
2018-03-12 13:13:04	Jesse	I was just gonna use script 
2018-03-12 13:13:18	Jesse	it automatically outputs the log to a file 
2018-03-12 13:13:31	ajshryoc	Yeah, whatever works

2018-03-12 14:41:24	Jesse	Alright, the transcripts are made. Can someone else do the work of submitting and making a cheap readme with some basic information like linking to the transcript file and how to run each of the games?

2018-03-16 10:06:54	Jesse	I'm gonna take a look now about what we can do to our project for submission 3. 
2018-03-16 10:13:12	Jesse	Nobody but me used cardsTest.py right? would you guys mind if I deleted that file? 
2018-03-16 10:17:46	Jesse	We may want to ask the professor about this... I worry our games are too different. 
2018-03-17 00:11:58	ajshryoc	You can delete cardsTest.py if no one is using it. I would probably make a new directory in the git repo called 'project3' or something so that we have a record of both of our submissions. As for the issues with the games, if you want to ask him, go ahead. I think we could make it work but I'm sure he could provide some insight. <--- Sorry typed this up about 14 hours ago and never hit send 
2018-03-19 14:19:24	Jesse	We got a 90% it seems on what we submitted for the project. He said he liked our nouns/verbs but was disappointed that we didn't make an FSM. He also linked "Derive Interfaces from Constraints of Data" as if its some reading on moodle or github. 
2018-03-19 14:19:57	Jesse	... I checked both, and I'm not sure what he's talking about 
2018-03-19 14:36:38	ajshryoc	I'm also unsure what he meant by that. Our design did get a shoutout in #proj2_mar1 though so that's pretty cool 
2018-03-19 14:38:04	Jesse	i didn't see that. that is pretty cool 
2018-03-19 14:38:44	ajshryoc	Also, just realized the section the he references is also in that Google doc with the feedback 
2018-03-19 15:03:59	jwstanl3	Even after looking at that section, I'm still not sure what he wants us to get from that. The lines he references are where the suits are printed in Crazy Eights to allow the user to select which suit to change to. I don't get how that could be changed. 
2018-03-19 16:30:23	ajshryoc	It could definitely be made better. I think the whole system, crazy eights especially, could benefit from state machines. I intended to cleanup some of that code, but I decided to just wait until this upcoming submission. I'll take a better look at the comments later 
2018-03-19 17:59:01	Jesse	I'm not sure I know how the system could be improved with FSMs. But if you know what you'd like to change, I could definitely help out with that. The issue I see with FSMs is that only crazy eights would use it... and it would just be wasted code for solitaire. 
2018-03-19 19:10:58	ajshryoc	I'm sure he'll provide more context tomorrow. I'll review their comments too and we can go from there 
2018-03-20 10:11:37	Jesse	Hey guys, I was checking out a few other peoples code, and i found one where they built the FSM setup stuff, and didn't call it anywhere in their code xD. I wonder if the graders caught it.

2018-03-28 20:49:16	Jesse	I guess the obvious answer would be to have all states and transitions be their own classes... but it also doesn't make sense for them to be their own classes when they might only have one variable or one method... and if the method just says pass, it doesn't really make sense to even have that method... 
2018-03-28 20:50:07	Jesse	And so you take the approach of having strings be states and methods being transitions... which is exactly how our code is now.. 
2018-03-28 20:50:32	Jesse	That's where my confusion with this project is. 
2018-03-28 20:52:56	ajshryoc	Yes, you're right and I'm not 100% sure how this implementation would work either. But, a lot of that I think could be solved by how it's implemented. For example, the State class could have a default implementation of each of its methods that is just "pass", that way, if you don't need the method, you don't worry about it. 
2018-03-28 20:55:40	ajshryoc	I think that Start, Play, Goal, and Fail could each be subclasses of State. When, as an example, Crazy Eights goes to instantiate a Start state, it should just have to pass in a lambda body that sets up the game. So, it wouldn't even need to subclass a new Start state (although it could). I think that it would look something like this: 
2018-03-28 20:55:45	ajshryoc	`start = new StartState(onEntry=setupCrazyEights)` 
2018-03-28 20:56:46	ajshryoc	`game.fsm = new FSM(start=start, play=runGame, end=endGame)` 
2018-03-28 20:57:07	ajshryoc	Or something like that. I may be oversimplifying things but I think it's doable 
2018-03-28 21:01:18	Jesse	I'll give it another shot tonight and let you know how it ends up tomorrow 
2018-03-28 21:02:43	ajshryoc	Okay, I will take a look at it too 
2018-03-28 21:24:44	Jesse	@Jesse uploaded a file: https://plm18.slack.com/files/U8N7VJU30/F9Z06TD0X/fsm.py (fsm) 
2018-03-28 21:24:51	Jesse	does that look like a good start? 
2018-03-28 21:32:03	Jesse	I really like the idea of passing in lambda bodies to abstract functions... that solved some of my 'why' questions earlier.. but its still kinda confusin  
2018-03-28 21:32:17	ajshryoc	Yeah, I think so. For the lambdas you pass in, you should just be able to pass in a function that performs the 'move' operation  (edited)
2018-03-28 21:32:36	ajshryoc	But, yeah I agree it is a little confusing 
2018-03-28 21:59:24	Jesse	nevermind, this whole thing seems stupid again... its like we're just making 4 methods for the sake of calling the same methods we would have initially. We pass the functions into some abstract class which just calls those methods in the abstract class... why not just call the functions? 
2018-03-28 22:04:45	Jesse	This whole process isn't saving us any lines of code... and as far as run-time and memory goes, this is more inefficient than what we've coded. It's even more unreadable too since theres more files for future programmers to go through. 
2018-03-28 23:14:21	ajshryoc	I'm working through a test version of crazy eights using an FSM, so hopefully that will help clear things up (if it works) 
2018-04-02 16:59:46	Jesse	Would either of you be free tonight to work on the plm stuff? or at least be free to instruct me on how I can help with the plm stuff? (since I haven't been very helpful so far) 
2018-04-02 17:32:35	ajshryoc	I am not free tonight to meet, but I should be able to push a working version of Crazy Eights with the FSM. Hopefully that will clear things up on how to implement the games with an FSM. Do you have ideas on things to change other than re-implementing the games with an FSM? 
2018-04-02 17:53:32	Jesse	not really, but we also have a paper we have to write. If I cannot find any improvements to the code, I'll try to get started on that.

2018-04-02 18:49:50	ajshryoc	I committed what I have so far to the other branch. You're welcome to take a look at it and continue developing it if that interests you. My approach so far has been to shove as much of what we already had as possible into the FSM. When I get back later, I will probably start rebuilding some of the functions passed into the FSM from the ground up to get rid of any issues I am just completely overlooking from our first iteration  (edited)
2018-04-02 19:10:11	Jesse	I think I'm going to get all of the non-fsm stuff into the CrazyEights.py file so it can be a lil more organized.

2018-04-02 20:17:07	ajshryoc	I like that idea. I was originally going to just have two versions of Crazy Eights until I got the FSM one working and then copy that over into CrazyEights.py, but I like your separation of logic here. I think at the very least we could label the FSM specification as the "domain specific language" he's looking for especially now that it's separated. 
2018-04-02 20:17:52	ajshryoc	Like I said before, I'm going to try re-writing the game logic to make it better-suited to the FSM to hopefully get rid of the bugs 
2018-04-02 20:18:24	Jesse	ok. im makin some changes now so don't do anything big :P 
2018-04-02 20:19:16	ajshryoc	Okay, no problem. Anything specific you are looking at or I should avoid? 
2018-04-02 20:20:56	Jesse	im trying to have everything output to a log file. it's just annoying because of how python handles inheritance 
2018-04-02 20:29:47	Jesse	the stupidly annoying thing about the log file is that every object needs one, and I can't open the same file multiple times without problems I don't think. 
2018-04-02 20:35:00	Jesse	i just undid my changes. You're free to edit it 
2018-04-02 20:35:22	ajshryoc	I'm unfamiliar with logs in python. Is there a specific package for it that giving you trouble or just using file i/o? 
2018-04-02 20:35:46	Jesse	I tried both  
2018-04-02 20:37:07	Jesse	either way, it would make us have a ton of duplicated code if we tried to put it in there.  
2018-04-02 20:54:54	Jesse	im gonna try to implement the solitaire stuff like you have with the fsms 
2018-04-02 20:56:14	ajshryoc	Okay, how do you want to get the FSM code? I could merge to master or you could branch off of crazy-eights-fsm 
2018-04-02 20:57:07	Jesse	ill just branch off crazy-eights-fsm 
2018-04-02 21:59:48	Jesse	it doesn't look like the guards are being called. 
2018-04-02 21:59:50	Jesse	are they? 
2018-04-02 22:50:13	Jesse	theres some bugs in the solitaire fsm but its pretty much there. 
2018-04-02 23:14:14	Jesse	let me know if you guys are wanting to do the "bonus projects" that menzies just listed a couple hours ago. 
2018-04-02 23:51:15	ajshryoc	Yeah, they're being called for me. I accidentally was calling them in the state object declaration for awhile though because I had the syntax wrong 
2018-04-02 23:51:27	ajshryoc	I'll look more into the bonus projects tomorrow

2018-04-05 18:11:41	Jesse	some of the package paths aren't working quite right on my system just pulling what you pushed from master 
2018-04-05 18:11:45	Jesse	I'll try to fix it. 
2018-04-05 18:21:58	ajshryoc	Sorry about that. Seemed to work for me 
2018-04-05 18:22:04	Jesse	I have no idea why this isn't working. didn't you guys run it on your systems? 
2018-04-05 18:37:19	ajshryoc	Yeah, it worked totally fine. Where's it tripping up? 
2018-04-05 18:37:57	Jesse	I would bet if you removed your __pycache__ directories, yours will be screwed up too 
2018-04-05 18:39:14	ajshryoc	Dang I didn't realize that would effect it 
2018-04-05 19:00:01	ajshryoc	I just tried deleting all the __pycache__ directories and everything still runs fine for me

2018-04-05 19:00:40	ajshryoc	Are you running python3 or just python? I know Joseph had an issue with that 
2018-04-05 19:00:53	Jesse	3 
2018-04-05 19:01:15	ajshryoc	What's the error it gives you? 
2018-04-05 19:08:39	Jesse	no module found 
2018-04-05 19:11:31	Jesse	if I run the game from the __main__ method then it doesn't give me that error. 
2018-04-05 19:13:21	Jesse	but it has an issue with the logger I made. 
2018-04-05 19:16:27	Jesse	got it workin 
2018-04-05 19:21:18	ajshryoc	Okay, good. Sorry about the issues 
2018-04-05 19:21:45	Jesse	it's fine. The logger is working to one file.

2018-02-20 10:30:28	Jesse	Yeah. Would you be able to meet after class andrew? I don't think we need a lot of time. My plan was just to use an hour or two to clean up some of the code in the generic game structure/UI's and implement any functionality you guys think would be good for both games. 
2018-02-20 10:32:21	Jesse	If not, I could meet with andrew an hour before class and then after class with Joseph for an hour. 
2018-02-20 11:36:11	ajshryoc	I could meet briefly right after class 
2018-02-20 11:36:34	Jesse	cool! 
2018-02-20 12:00:47	jwstanl3	I have the solitaire game pretty much working completely, but I changed some things in the cards and SolitaireUI files, so I'll wait until we meet to commit anything 
2018-02-20 12:03:24	jwstanl3	@jwstanl3 uploaded a file: https://plm18.slack.com/files/U8N1B358V/F9B8MRFL0/solitaire.gif (Solitaire GIF) and commented: Here's a GIF of the game.  The only thing I haven't implemented is win and loss states. 
2018-02-20 13:05:32	Jesse	thats awesome!! but arent the red cards supposed to go on black cards and vice versa? 
2018-02-20 13:05:45	Jesse	its okay if we want to change it for the sake of project scope 
2018-02-20 13:05:53	Jesse	to be red on red 
2018-02-20 13:08:42	jwstanl3	The rules from Bicycle didn't have any restrictions on color. It just had to be consecutive. But, yea, normally you would alternate colors, and it would be pretty easy to switch the program to follow that. 
2018-02-20 13:09:15	jwstanl3	The game's really easy at the moment, so adding something like that would help it be more challenging.

2018-02-21 20:28:57	jwstanl3	I pushed some fixes to my solitaire code. Cards have to alternate in color now in the stacks. There were a few other bugs I fixed. I still haven't added a win state, or a loss state really, but it should be able to detect a win or loss, if the loss state doesn't have any moves left. I haven't been able to beat the game since adding the alternating colors, so I'm not sure if this is true or not.

2018-02-22 22:08:38	ajshryoc	Added what I have for crazy eights. I think the only major feature missing is the suit change when playing an 8. I also intend to clean up the code and little bit to get rid of redundancy.  (edited)
2018-02-22 22:12:02	Jesse	great!! I'll probably take a look some time this weekend

2018-02-24 12:28:32	Jesse	Do you guys understand python decorators? I haven't been able to reproduce a function that demonstrates the difference with/without the decorator. 
2018-02-25 20:28:31	ajshryoc	Sorry, intended to respond, then totally forgot about this. My understanding of python decorators is it's just another form of syntax for calling functions; however, it sort of ties two functions together and modifies the function being decorated. Here's an article I found that gives a good explanation on the subject: http://python-3-patterns-idioms-test.readthedocs.io/en/latest/PythonDecorators.html

2018-02-25 22:39:22	ajshryoc	Just pushed the finished version of Crazy Eights. It's kinda a mess, so I'll probably do some refactoring of it at some point. I also modified cards.py to print out the unicode symbol corresponding to the card's suit. I was curious about how to do it and it turned out to be really easy, so I added it. I think it makes it much easier to see the cards 
2018-02-25 22:41:04	Jesse	oh nice!!! let me know if theres anything youd like me to change.  
2018-02-26 13:50:38	Jesse	I played both crazy eights and solitaire and I haven't noticed any bugs. winning looks good as well. 
2018-02-26 13:52:31	Jesse	we may be able to polish a few things up but honestly, it doesn't matter too much because we'll be taking parts of our code out and re implementing stuff for the second submission. I think what we have is gold. If there's anything you guys want me to change, just let me know. 
2018-02-26 17:12:29	ajshryoc	Glad you liked it! I think they both play pretty well

2018-03-12 13:12:50	ajshryoc	I don't have a transcript. You should be able to use the tee command to output to a file and stdout 
2018-03-12 13:13:04	Jesse	I was just gonna use script 
2018-03-12 13:13:18	Jesse	it automatically outputs the log to a file

2018-03-16 10:06:54	Jesse	I'm gonna take a look now about what we can do to our project for submission 3. 
2018-03-16 10:13:12	Jesse	Nobody but me used cardsTest.py right? would you guys mind if I deleted that file? 
2018-03-16 10:17:46	Jesse	We may want to ask the professor about this... I worry our games are too different. 
2018-03-17 00:11:58	ajshryoc	You can delete cardsTest.py if no one is using it. I would probably make a new directory in the git repo called 'project3' or something so that we have a record of both of our submissions. As for the issues with the games, if you want to ask him, go ahead. I think we could make it work but I'm sure he could provide some insight. <--- Sorry typed this up about 14 hours ago and never hit send 
2018-03-19 14:19:24	Jesse	We got a 90% it seems on what we submitted for the project. He said he liked our nouns/verbs but was disappointed that we didn't make an FSM. He also linked "Derive Interfaces from Constraints of Data" as if its some reading on moodle or github. 
2018-03-19 14:19:57	Jesse	... I checked both, and I'm not sure what he's talking about 
2018-03-19 14:36:38	ajshryoc	I'm also unsure what he meant by that. Our design did get a shoutout in #proj2_mar1 though so that's pretty cool 
2018-03-19 14:38:04	Jesse	i didn't see that. that is pretty cool 
2018-03-19 14:38:44	ajshryoc	Also, just realized the section the he references is also in that Google doc with the feedback 
2018-03-19 15:03:59	jwstanl3	Even after looking at that section, I'm still not sure what he wants us to get from that. The lines he references are where the suits are printed in Crazy Eights to allow the user to select which suit to change to. I don't get how that could be changed. 
2018-03-19 16:30:23	ajshryoc	It could definitely be made better. I think the whole system, crazy eights especially, could benefit from state machines. I intended to cleanup some of that code, but I decided to just wait until this upcoming submission. I'll take a better look at the comments later 
2018-03-19 17:59:01	Jesse	I'm not sure I know how the system could be improved with FSMs. But if you know what you'd like to change, I could definitely help out with that. The issue I see with FSMs is that only crazy eights would use it... and it would just be wasted code for solitaire. 
2018-03-19 19:10:58	ajshryoc	I'm sure he'll provide more context tomorrow. I'll review their comments too and we can go from there 
2018-03-20 10:11:37	Jesse	Hey guys, I was checking out a few other peoples code, and i found one where they built the FSM setup stuff, and didn't call it anywhere in their code xD. I wonder if the graders caught it.

2018-03-26 20:45:46	Jesse	hey guys, wanna meet up tomorrow to work on the plm project? 
2018-03-26 21:35:12	jwstanl3	Sure. Could we meet tomorrow after class? 
2018-03-26 21:59:18	Jesse	yeah 
2018-03-26 22:12:02	ajshryoc	That works for me

2018-03-28 20:46:28	Jesse	I get what you mean, and I tried coding that up last night, but I'm struggling with what should be classes vs methods vs variables, and how should all of these things be linked up together?   
2018-03-28 20:49:16	Jesse	I guess the obvious answer would be to have all states and transitions be their own classes... but it also doesn't make sense for them to be their own classes when they might only have one variable or one method... and if the method just says pass, it doesn't really make sense to even have that method... 
2018-03-28 20:50:07	Jesse	And so you take the approach of having strings be states and methods being transitions... which is exactly how our code is now.. 
2018-03-28 20:50:32	Jesse	That's where my confusion with this project is. 
2018-03-28 20:52:56	ajshryoc	Yes, you're right and I'm not 100% sure how this implementation would work either. But, a lot of that I think could be solved by how it's implemented. For example, the State class could have a default implementation of each of its methods that is just "pass", that way, if you don't need the method, you don't worry about it. 
2018-03-28 20:55:40	ajshryoc	I think that Start, Play, Goal, and Fail could each be subclasses of State. When, as an example, Crazy Eights goes to instantiate a Start state, it should just have to pass in a lambda body that sets up the game. So, it wouldn't even need to subclass a new Start state (although it could). I think that it would look something like this: 
2018-03-28 20:55:45	ajshryoc	`start = new StartState(onEntry=setupCrazyEights)` 
2018-03-28 20:56:46	ajshryoc	`game.fsm = new FSM(start=start, play=runGame, end=endGame)` 
2018-03-28 20:57:07	ajshryoc	Or something like that. I may be oversimplifying things but I think it's doable 
2018-03-28 21:01:18	Jesse	I'll give it another shot tonight and let you know how it ends up tomorrow 
2018-03-28 21:02:43	ajshryoc	Okay, I will take a look at it too 
2018-03-28 21:24:44	Jesse	@Jesse uploaded a file: https://plm18.slack.com/files/U8N7VJU30/F9Z06TD0X/fsm.py (fsm) 
2018-03-28 21:24:51	Jesse	does that look like a good start? 
2018-03-28 21:32:03	Jesse	I really like the idea of passing in lambda bodies to abstract functions... that solved some of my 'why' questions earlier.. but its still kinda confusin  
2018-03-28 21:32:17	ajshryoc	Yeah, I think so. For the lambdas you pass in, you should just be able to pass in a function that performs the 'move' operation  (edited)
2018-03-28 21:32:36	ajshryoc	But, yeah I agree it is a little confusing 
2018-03-28 21:59:24	Jesse	nevermind, this whole thing seems stupid again... its like we're just making 4 methods for the sake of calling the same methods we would have initially. We pass the functions into some abstract class which just calls those methods in the abstract class... why not just call the functions? 
2018-03-28 22:04:45	Jesse	This whole process isn't saving us any lines of code... and as far as run-time and memory goes, this is more inefficient than what we've coded. It's even more unreadable too since theres more files for future programmers to go through. 
2018-03-28 23:14:21	ajshryoc	I'm working through a test version of crazy eights using an FSM, so hopefully that will help clear things up (if it works) 
2018-04-02 16:59:46	Jesse	Would either of you be free tonight to work on the plm stuff? or at least be free to instruct me on how I can help with the plm stuff? (since I haven't been very helpful so far) 
2018-04-02 17:32:35	ajshryoc	I am not free tonight to meet, but I should be able to push a working version of Crazy Eights with the FSM. Hopefully that will clear things up on how to implement the games with an FSM. Do you have ideas on things to change other than re-implementing the games with an FSM? 
2018-04-02 17:53:32	Jesse	not really, but we also have a paper we have to write. If I cannot find any improvements to the code, I'll try to get started on that.

2018-04-02 18:49:50	ajshryoc	I committed what I have so far to the other branch. You're welcome to take a look at it and continue developing it if that interests you. My approach so far has been to shove as much of what we already had as possible into the FSM. When I get back later, I will probably start rebuilding some of the functions passed into the FSM from the ground up to get rid of any issues I am just completely overlooking from our first iteration  (edited)
2018-04-02 19:10:11	Jesse	I think I'm going to get all of the non-fsm stuff into the CrazyEights.py file so it can be a lil more organized.

2018-04-02 20:17:07	ajshryoc	I like that idea. I was originally going to just have two versions of Crazy Eights until I got the FSM one working and then copy that over into CrazyEights.py, but I like your separation of logic here. I think at the very least we could label the FSM specification as the "domain specific language" he's looking for especially now that it's separated. 
2018-04-02 20:17:52	ajshryoc	Like I said before, I'm going to try re-writing the game logic to make it better-suited to the FSM to hopefully get rid of the bugs 
2018-04-02 20:18:24	Jesse	ok. im makin some changes now so don't do anything big :P 
2018-04-02 20:19:16	ajshryoc	Okay, no problem. Anything specific you are looking at or I should avoid? 
2018-04-02 20:20:56	Jesse	im trying to have everything output to a log file. it's just annoying because of how python handles inheritance 
2018-04-02 20:29:47	Jesse	the stupidly annoying thing about the log file is that every object needs one, and I can't open the same file multiple times without problems I don't think. 
2018-04-02 20:35:00	Jesse	i just undid my changes. You're free to edit it 
2018-04-02 20:35:22	ajshryoc	I'm unfamiliar with logs in python. Is there a specific package for it that giving you trouble or just using file i/o? 
2018-04-02 20:35:46	Jesse	I tried both  
2018-04-02 20:37:07	Jesse	either way, it would make us have a ton of duplicated code if we tried to put it in there.  
2018-04-02 20:54:54	Jesse	im gonna try to implement the solitaire stuff like you have with the fsms 
2018-04-02 20:56:14	ajshryoc	Okay, how do you want to get the FSM code? I could merge to master or you could branch off of crazy-eights-fsm 
2018-04-02 20:57:07	Jesse	ill just branch off crazy-eights-fsm 
2018-04-02 21:59:48	Jesse	it doesn't look like the guards are being called. 
2018-04-02 21:59:50	Jesse	are they? 
2018-04-02 22:50:13	Jesse	theres some bugs in the solitaire fsm but its pretty much there. 
2018-04-02 23:14:14	Jesse	let me know if you guys are wanting to do the "bonus projects" that menzies just listed a couple hours ago. 
2018-04-02 23:51:15	ajshryoc	Yeah, they're being called for me. I accidentally was calling them in the state object declaration for awhile though because I had the syntax wrong 
2018-04-02 23:51:27	ajshryoc	I'll look more into the bonus projects tomorrow

2018-02-20 10:30:28	Jesse	Yeah. Would you be able to meet after class andrew? I don't think we need a lot of time. My plan was just to use an hour or two to clean up some of the code in the generic game structure/UI's and implement any functionality you guys think would be good for both games. 
2018-02-20 10:32:21	Jesse	If not, I could meet with andrew an hour before class and then after class with Joseph for an hour.

2018-02-20 12:00:47	jwstanl3	I have the solitaire game pretty much working completely, but I changed some things in the cards and SolitaireUI files, so I'll wait until we meet to commit anything 
2018-02-20 12:03:24	jwstanl3	@jwstanl3 uploaded a file: https://plm18.slack.com/files/U8N1B358V/F9B8MRFL0/solitaire.gif (Solitaire GIF) and commented: Here's a GIF of the game.  The only thing I haven't implemented is win and loss states. 
2018-02-20 13:05:32	Jesse	thats awesome!! but arent the red cards supposed to go on black cards and vice versa? 
2018-02-20 13:05:45	Jesse	its okay if we want to change it for the sake of project scope 
2018-02-20 13:05:53	Jesse	to be red on red 
2018-02-20 13:08:42	jwstanl3	The rules from Bicycle didn't have any restrictions on color. It just had to be consecutive. But, yea, normally you would alternate colors, and it would be pretty easy to switch the program to follow that. 
2018-02-20 13:09:15	jwstanl3	The game's really easy at the moment, so adding something like that would help it be more challenging.

2018-02-21 20:28:57	jwstanl3	I pushed some fixes to my solitaire code. Cards have to alternate in color now in the stacks. There were a few other bugs I fixed. I still haven't added a win state, or a loss state really, but it should be able to detect a win or loss, if the loss state doesn't have any moves left. I haven't been able to beat the game since adding the alternating colors, so I'm not sure if this is true or not.

2018-02-22 22:08:38	ajshryoc	Added what I have for crazy eights. I think the only major feature missing is the suit change when playing an 8. I also intend to clean up the code and little bit to get rid of redundancy.  (edited)
2018-02-22 22:12:02	Jesse	great!! I'll probably take a look some time this weekend

2018-02-24 12:28:32	Jesse	Do you guys understand python decorators? I haven't been able to reproduce a function that demonstrates the difference with/without the decorator. 
2018-02-25 20:28:31	ajshryoc	Sorry, intended to respond, then totally forgot about this. My understanding of python decorators is it's just another form of syntax for calling functions; however, it sort of ties two functions together and modifies the function being decorated. Here's an article I found that gives a good explanation on the subject: http://python-3-patterns-idioms-test.readthedocs.io/en/latest/PythonDecorators.html

2018-02-25 22:39:22	ajshryoc	Just pushed the finished version of Crazy Eights. It's kinda a mess, so I'll probably do some refactoring of it at some point. I also modified cards.py to print out the unicode symbol corresponding to the card's suit. I was curious about how to do it and it turned out to be really easy, so I added it. I think it makes it much easier to see the cards 
2018-02-25 22:41:04	Jesse	oh nice!!! let me know if theres anything youd like me to change.  
2018-02-26 13:50:38	Jesse	I played both crazy eights and solitaire and I haven't noticed any bugs. winning looks good as well. 
2018-02-26 13:52:31	Jesse	we may be able to polish a few things up but honestly, it doesn't matter too much because we'll be taking parts of our code out and re implementing stuff for the second submission. I think what we have is gold. If there's anything you guys want me to change, just let me know. 
2018-02-26 17:12:29	ajshryoc	Glad you liked it! I think they both play pretty well

2018-03-12 13:12:50	ajshryoc	I don't have a transcript. You should be able to use the tee command to output to a file and stdout 
2018-03-12 13:13:04	Jesse	I was just gonna use script

2018-03-16 10:06:54	Jesse	I'm gonna take a look now about what we can do to our project for submission 3. 
2018-03-16 10:13:12	Jesse	Nobody but me used cardsTest.py right? would you guys mind if I deleted that file? 
2018-03-16 10:17:46	Jesse	We may want to ask the professor about this... I worry our games are too different. 
2018-03-17 00:11:58	ajshryoc	You can delete cardsTest.py if no one is using it. I would probably make a new directory in the git repo called 'project3' or something so that we have a record of both of our submissions. As for the issues with the games, if you want to ask him, go ahead. I think we could make it work but I'm sure he could provide some insight. <--- Sorry typed this up about 14 hours ago and never hit send 
2018-03-19 14:19:24	Jesse	We got a 90% it seems on what we submitted for the project. He said he liked our nouns/verbs but was disappointed that we didn't make an FSM. He also linked "Derive Interfaces from Constraints of Data" as if its some reading on moodle or github. 
2018-03-19 14:19:57	Jesse	... I checked both, and I'm not sure what he's talking about 
2018-03-19 14:36:38	ajshryoc	I'm also unsure what he meant by that. Our design did get a shoutout in #proj2_mar1 though so that's pretty cool 
2018-03-19 14:38:04	Jesse	i didn't see that. that is pretty cool 
2018-03-19 14:38:44	ajshryoc	Also, just realized the section the he references is also in that Google doc with the feedback 
2018-03-19 15:03:59	jwstanl3	Even after looking at that section, I'm still not sure what he wants us to get from that. The lines he references are where the suits are printed in Crazy Eights to allow the user to select which suit to change to. I don't get how that could be changed. 
2018-03-19 16:30:23	ajshryoc	It could definitely be made better. I think the whole system, crazy eights especially, could benefit from state machines. I intended to cleanup some of that code, but I decided to just wait until this upcoming submission. I'll take a better look at the comments later 
2018-03-19 17:59:01	Jesse	I'm not sure I know how the system could be improved with FSMs. But if you know what you'd like to change, I could definitely help out with that. The issue I see with FSMs is that only crazy eights would use it... and it would just be wasted code for solitaire. 
2018-03-19 19:10:58	ajshryoc	I'm sure he'll provide more context tomorrow. I'll review their comments too and we can go from there 
2018-03-20 10:11:37	Jesse	Hey guys, I was checking out a few other peoples code, and i found one where they built the FSM setup stuff, and didn't call it anywhere in their code xD. I wonder if the graders caught it.

2018-03-28 20:46:28	Jesse	I get what you mean, and I tried coding that up last night, but I'm struggling with what should be classes vs methods vs variables, and how should all of these things be linked up together?   
2018-03-28 20:49:16	Jesse	I guess the obvious answer would be to have all states and transitions be their own classes... but it also doesn't make sense for them to be their own classes when they might only have one variable or one method... and if the method just says pass, it doesn't really make sense to even have that method... 
2018-03-28 20:50:07	Jesse	And so you take the approach of having strings be states and methods being transitions... which is exactly how our code is now.. 
2018-03-28 20:50:32	Jesse	That's where my confusion with this project is. 
2018-03-28 20:52:56	ajshryoc	Yes, you're right and I'm not 100% sure how this implementation would work either. But, a lot of that I think could be solved by how it's implemented. For example, the State class could have a default implementation of each of its methods that is just "pass", that way, if you don't need the method, you don't worry about it. 
2018-03-28 20:55:40	ajshryoc	I think that Start, Play, Goal, and Fail could each be subclasses of State. When, as an example, Crazy Eights goes to instantiate a Start state, it should just have to pass in a lambda body that sets up the game. So, it wouldn't even need to subclass a new Start state (although it could). I think that it would look something like this: 
2018-03-28 20:55:45	ajshryoc	`start = new StartState(onEntry=setupCrazyEights)` 
2018-03-28 20:56:46	ajshryoc	`game.fsm = new FSM(start=start, play=runGame, end=endGame)` 
2018-03-28 20:57:07	ajshryoc	Or something like that. I may be oversimplifying things but I think it's doable 
2018-03-28 21:01:18	Jesse	I'll give it another shot tonight and let you know how it ends up tomorrow 
2018-03-28 21:02:43	ajshryoc	Okay, I will take a look at it too 
2018-03-28 21:24:44	Jesse	@Jesse uploaded a file: https://plm18.slack.com/files/U8N7VJU30/F9Z06TD0X/fsm.py (fsm) 
2018-03-28 21:24:51	Jesse	does that look like a good start? 
2018-03-28 21:32:03	Jesse	I really like the idea of passing in lambda bodies to abstract functions... that solved some of my 'why' questions earlier.. but its still kinda confusin  
2018-03-28 21:32:17	ajshryoc	Yeah, I think so. For the lambdas you pass in, you should just be able to pass in a function that performs the 'move' operation  (edited)
2018-03-28 21:32:36	ajshryoc	But, yeah I agree it is a little confusing 
2018-03-28 21:59:24	Jesse	nevermind, this whole thing seems stupid again... its like we're just making 4 methods for the sake of calling the same methods we would have initially. We pass the functions into some abstract class which just calls those methods in the abstract class... why not just call the functions? 
2018-03-28 22:04:45	Jesse	This whole process isn't saving us any lines of code... and as far as run-time and memory goes, this is more inefficient than what we've coded. It's even more unreadable too since theres more files for future programmers to go through. 
2018-03-28 23:14:21	ajshryoc	I'm working through a test version of crazy eights using an FSM, so hopefully that will help clear things up (if it works) 
2018-04-02 16:59:46	Jesse	Would either of you be free tonight to work on the plm stuff? or at least be free to instruct me on how I can help with the plm stuff? (since I haven't been very helpful so far) 
2018-04-02 17:32:35	ajshryoc	I am not free tonight to meet, but I should be able to push a working version of Crazy Eights with the FSM. Hopefully that will clear things up on how to implement the games with an FSM. Do you have ideas on things to change other than re-implementing the games with an FSM? 
2018-04-02 17:53:32	Jesse	not really, but we also have a paper we have to write. If I cannot find any improvements to the code, I'll try to get started on that.

2018-04-02 18:49:50	ajshryoc	I committed what I have so far to the other branch. You're welcome to take a look at it and continue developing it if that interests you. My approach so far has been to shove as much of what we already had as possible into the FSM. When I get back later, I will probably start rebuilding some of the functions passed into the FSM from the ground up to get rid of any issues I am just completely overlooking from our first iteration  (edited)
2018-04-02 19:10:11	Jesse	I think I'm going to get all of the non-fsm stuff into the CrazyEights.py file so it can be a lil more organized.

2018-04-02 20:17:07	ajshryoc	I like that idea. I was originally going to just have two versions of Crazy Eights until I got the FSM one working and then copy that over into CrazyEights.py, but I like your separation of logic here. I think at the very least we could label the FSM specification as the "domain specific language" he's looking for especially now that it's separated. 
2018-04-02 20:17:52	ajshryoc	Like I said before, I'm going to try re-writing the game logic to make it better-suited to the FSM to hopefully get rid of the bugs 
2018-04-02 20:18:24	Jesse	ok. im makin some changes now so don't do anything big :P 
2018-04-02 20:19:16	ajshryoc	Okay, no problem. Anything specific you are looking at or I should avoid? 
2018-04-02 20:20:56	Jesse	im trying to have everything output to a log file. it's just annoying because of how python handles inheritance 
2018-04-02 20:29:47	Jesse	the stupidly annoying thing about the log file is that every object needs one, and I can't open the same file multiple times without problems I don't think. 
2018-04-02 20:35:00	Jesse	i just undid my changes. You're free to edit it 
2018-04-02 20:35:22	ajshryoc	I'm unfamiliar with logs in python. Is there a specific package for it that giving you trouble or just using file i/o? 
2018-04-02 20:35:46	Jesse	I tried both  
2018-04-02 20:37:07	Jesse	either way, it would make us have a ton of duplicated code if we tried to put it in there.  
2018-04-02 20:54:54	Jesse	im gonna try to implement the solitaire stuff like you have with the fsms 
2018-04-02 20:56:14	ajshryoc	Okay, how do you want to get the FSM code? I could merge to master or you could branch off of crazy-eights-fsm 
2018-04-02 20:57:07	Jesse	ill just branch off crazy-eights-fsm 
2018-04-02 21:59:48	Jesse	it doesn't look like the guards are being called. 
2018-04-02 21:59:50	Jesse	are they? 
2018-04-02 22:50:13	Jesse	theres some bugs in the solitaire fsm but its pretty much there.

2018-04-06 15:23:12	Jesse	hey guys, what other changes were you guys wanting to add to the project. I might be able to get something done now, but I'd need to know what. 
2018-04-06 15:31:34	ajshryoc	Crazy eights could use some more refactoring if you're up for that. I think pulling out the UI components to another module would clean things up. I also think we should consider ways to get rid of the payload params for transitions and states. Maybe define a generic environment  (Game) that that state machine passes around and the guards/state functions all know about. Not sure how hard that would be to implement 
2018-04-06 16:08:02	Jesse	Sorry I'm getting distracted playing with my raspberry pi. I'll try to work on that a lil later today. 
2018-04-06 16:28:15	ajshryoc	No problem. Was just a suggestion for where to go from here 
2018-04-07 10:15:57		getting channel history...
2018-02-20 12:00:47	jwstanl3	I have the solitaire game pretty much working completely, but I changed some things in the cards and SolitaireUI files, so I'll wait until we meet to commit anything 
2018-02-20 12:03:24	jwstanl3	@jwstanl3 uploaded a file: https://plm18.slack.com/files/U8N1B358V/F9B8MRFL0/solitaire.gif (Solitaire GIF) and commented: Here's a GIF of the game.  The only thing I haven't implemented is win and loss states. 
2018-02-20 13:05:32	Jesse	thats awesome!! but arent the red cards supposed to go on black cards and vice versa? 
2018-02-20 13:05:45	Jesse	its okay if we want to change it for the sake of project scope 
2018-02-20 13:05:53	Jesse	to be red on red 
2018-02-20 13:08:42	jwstanl3	The rules from Bicycle didn't have any restrictions on color. It just had to be consecutive. But, yea, normally you would alternate colors, and it would be pretty easy to switch the program to follow that. 
2018-02-20 13:09:15	jwstanl3	The game's really easy at the moment, so adding something like that would help it be more challenging.

2018-02-21 20:28:57	jwstanl3	I pushed some fixes to my solitaire code. Cards have to alternate in color now in the stacks. There were a few other bugs I fixed. I still haven't added a win state, or a loss state really, but it should be able to detect a win or loss, if the loss state doesn't have any moves left. I haven't been able to beat the game since adding the alternating colors, so I'm not sure if this is true or not.

2018-02-22 22:08:38	ajshryoc	Added what I have for crazy eights. I think the only major feature missing is the suit change when playing an 8. I also intend to clean up the code and little bit to get rid of redundancy.  (edited)

2018-02-24 12:28:32	Jesse	Do you guys understand python decorators? I haven't been able to reproduce a function that demonstrates the difference with/without the decorator. 
2018-02-25 20:28:31	ajshryoc	Sorry, intended to respond, then totally forgot about this. My understanding of python decorators is it's just another form of syntax for calling functions; however, it sort of ties two functions together and modifies the function being decorated. Here's an article I found that gives a good explanation on the subject: http://python-3-patterns-idioms-test.readthedocs.io/en/latest/PythonDecorators.html

2018-02-25 22:39:22	ajshryoc	Just pushed the finished version of Crazy Eights. It's kinda a mess, so I'll probably do some refactoring of it at some point. I also modified cards.py to print out the unicode symbol corresponding to the card's suit. I was curious about how to do it and it turned out to be really easy, so I added it. I think it makes it much easier to see the cards 
2018-02-25 22:41:04	Jesse	oh nice!!! let me know if theres anything youd like me to change.  
2018-02-26 13:50:38	Jesse	I played both crazy eights and solitaire and I haven't noticed any bugs. winning looks good as well. 
2018-02-26 13:52:31	Jesse	we may be able to polish a few things up but honestly, it doesn't matter too much because we'll be taking parts of our code out and re implementing stuff for the second submission.

2018-03-16 10:06:54	Jesse	I'm gonna take a look now about what we can do to our project for submission 3. 
2018-03-16 10:13:12	Jesse	Nobody but me used cardsTest.py right? would you guys mind if I deleted that file? 
2018-03-16 10:17:46	Jesse	We may want to ask the professor about this... I worry our games are too different. 
2018-03-17 00:11:58	ajshryoc	You can delete cardsTest.py if no one is using it. I would probably make a new directory in the git repo called 'project3' or something so that we have a record of both of our submissions. As for the issues with the games, if you want to ask him, go ahead. I think we could make it work but I'm sure he could provide some insight. <--- Sorry typed this up about 14 hours ago and never hit send 
2018-03-19 14:19:24	Jesse	We got a 90% it seems on what we submitted for the project. He said he liked our nouns/verbs but was disappointed that we didn't make an FSM. He also linked "Derive Interfaces from Constraints of Data" as if its some reading on moodle or github. 
2018-03-19 14:19:57	Jesse	... I checked both, and I'm not sure what he's talking about 
2018-03-19 14:36:38	ajshryoc	I'm also unsure what he meant by that. Our design did get a shoutout in #proj2_mar1 though so that's pretty cool 
2018-03-19 14:38:04	Jesse	i didn't see that. that is pretty cool 
2018-03-19 14:38:44	ajshryoc	Also, just realized the section the he references is also in that Google doc with the feedback 
2018-03-19 15:03:59	jwstanl3	Even after looking at that section, I'm still not sure what he wants us to get from that. The lines he references are where the suits are printed in Crazy Eights to allow the user to select which suit to change to. I don't get how that could be changed. 
2018-03-19 16:30:23	ajshryoc	It could definitely be made better. I think the whole system, crazy eights especially, could benefit from state machines. I intended to cleanup some of that code, but I decided to just wait until this upcoming submission. I'll take a better look at the comments later 
2018-03-19 17:59:01	Jesse	I'm not sure I know how the system could be improved with FSMs. But if you know what you'd like to change, I could definitely help out with that. The issue I see with FSMs is that only crazy eights would use it... and it would just be wasted code for solitaire. 
2018-03-19 19:10:58	ajshryoc	I'm sure he'll provide more context tomorrow. I'll review their comments too and we can go from there 
2018-03-20 10:11:37	Jesse	Hey guys, I was checking out a few other peoples code, and i found one where they built the FSM setup stuff, and didn't call it anywhere in their code xD. I wonder if the graders caught it.

2018-03-28 20:46:28	Jesse	I get what you mean, and I tried coding that up last night, but I'm struggling with what should be classes vs methods vs variables, and how should all of these things be linked up together?   
2018-03-28 20:49:16	Jesse	I guess the obvious answer would be to have all states and transitions be their own classes... but it also doesn't make sense for them to be their own classes when they might only have one variable or one method... and if the method just says pass, it doesn't really make sense to even have that method... 
2018-03-28 20:50:07	Jesse	And so you take the approach of having strings be states and methods being transitions... which is exactly how our code is now.. 
2018-03-28 20:50:32	Jesse	That's where my confusion with this project is. 
2018-03-28 20:52:56	ajshryoc	Yes, you're right and I'm not 100% sure how this implementation would work either. But, a lot of that I think could be solved by how it's implemented. For example, the State class could have a default implementation of each of its methods that is just "pass", that way, if you don't need the method, you don't worry about it. 
2018-03-28 20:55:40	ajshryoc	I think that Start, Play, Goal, and Fail could each be subclasses of State. When, as an example, Crazy Eights goes to instantiate a Start state, it should just have to pass in a lambda body that sets up the game. So, it wouldn't even need to subclass a new Start state (although it could). I think that it would look something like this: 
2018-03-28 20:55:45	ajshryoc	`start = new StartState(onEntry=setupCrazyEights)` 
2018-03-28 20:56:46	ajshryoc	`game.fsm = new FSM(start=start, play=runGame, end=endGame)` 
2018-03-28 20:57:07	ajshryoc	Or something like that. I may be oversimplifying things but I think it's doable 
2018-03-28 21:01:18	Jesse	I'll give it another shot tonight and let you know how it ends up tomorrow 
2018-03-28 21:02:43	ajshryoc	Okay, I will take a look at it too 
2018-03-28 21:24:44	Jesse	@Jesse uploaded a file: https://plm18.slack.com/files/U8N7VJU30/F9Z06TD0X/fsm.py (fsm) 
2018-03-28 21:24:51	Jesse	does that look like a good start? 
2018-03-28 21:32:03	Jesse	I really like the idea of passing in lambda bodies to abstract functions... that solved some of my 'why' questions earlier.. but its still kinda confusin  
2018-03-28 21:32:17	ajshryoc	Yeah, I think so. For the lambdas you pass in, you should just be able to pass in a function that performs the 'move' operation  (edited)
2018-03-28 21:32:36	ajshryoc	But, yeah I agree it is a little confusing 
2018-03-28 21:59:24	Jesse	nevermind, this whole thing seems stupid again... its like we're just making 4 methods for the sake of calling the same methods we would have initially. We pass the functions into some abstract class which just calls those methods in the abstract class... why not just call the functions? 
2018-03-28 22:04:45	Jesse	This whole process isn't saving us any lines of code... and as far as run-time and memory goes, this is more inefficient than what we've coded. It's even more unreadable too since theres more files for future programmers to go through. 
2018-03-28 23:14:21	ajshryoc	I'm working through a test version of crazy eights using an FSM, so hopefully that will help clear things up (if it works) 
2018-04-02 16:59:46	Jesse	Would either of you be free tonight to work on the plm stuff? or at least be free to instruct me on how I can help with the plm stuff? (since I haven't been very helpful so far) 
2018-04-02 17:32:35	ajshryoc	I am not free tonight to meet, but I should be able to push a working version of Crazy Eights with the FSM. Hopefully that will clear things up on how to implement the games with an FSM. Do you have ideas on things to change other than re-implementing the games with an FSM? 
2018-04-02 17:53:32	Jesse	not really, but we also have a paper we have to write. If I cannot find any improvements to the code, I'll try to get started on that.

2018-04-02 18:49:50	ajshryoc	I committed what I have so far to the other branch. You're welcome to take a look at it and continue developing it if that interests you. My approach so far has been to shove as much of what we already had as possible into the FSM. When I get back later, I will probably start rebuilding some of the functions passed into the FSM from the ground up to get rid of any issues I am just completely overlooking from our first iteration  (edited)
2018-04-02 19:10:11	Jesse	I think I'm going to get all of the non-fsm stuff into the CrazyEights.py file so it can be a lil more organized.

2018-04-02 20:17:07	ajshryoc	I like that idea. I was originally going to just have two versions of Crazy Eights until I got the FSM one working and then copy that over into CrazyEights.py, but I like your separation of logic here. I think at the very least we could label the FSM specification as the "domain specific language" he's looking for especially now that it's separated. 
2018-04-02 20:17:52	ajshryoc	Like I said before, I'm going to try re-writing the game logic to make it better-suited to the FSM to hopefully get rid of the bugs 
2018-04-02 20:18:24	Jesse	ok. im makin some changes now so don't do anything big :P 
2018-04-02 20:19:16	ajshryoc	Okay, no problem. Anything specific you are looking at or I should avoid? 
2018-04-02 20:20:56	Jesse	im trying to have everything output to a log file. it's just annoying because of how python handles inheritance 
2018-04-02 20:29:47	Jesse	the stupidly annoying thing about the log file is that every object needs one, and I can't open the same file multiple times without problems I don't think. 
2018-04-02 20:35:00	Jesse	i just undid my changes. You're free to edit it 
2018-04-02 20:35:22	ajshryoc	I'm unfamiliar with logs in python. Is there a specific package for it that giving you trouble or just using file i/o? 
2018-04-02 20:35:46	Jesse	I tried both  
2018-04-02 20:37:07	Jesse	either way, it would make us have a ton of duplicated code if we tried to put it in there.  
2018-04-02 20:54:54	Jesse	im gonna try to implement the solitaire stuff like you have with the fsms 
2018-04-02 20:56:14	ajshryoc	Okay, how do you want to get the FSM code? I could merge to master or you could branch off of crazy-eights-fsm 
2018-04-02 20:57:07	Jesse	ill just branch off crazy-eights-fsm 
2018-04-02 21:59:48	Jesse	it doesn't look like the guards are being called. 
2018-04-02 21:59:50	Jesse	are they? 
2018-04-02 22:50:13	Jesse	theres some bugs in the solitaire fsm but its pretty much there. 
2018-04-02 23:14:14	Jesse	let me know if you guys are wanting to do the "bonus projects" that menzies just listed a couple hours ago. 
2018-04-02 23:51:15	ajshryoc	Yeah, they're being called for me. I accidentally was calling them in the state object declaration for awhile though because I had the syntax wrong

2018-04-06 15:23:12	Jesse	hey guys, what other changes were you guys wanting to add to the project. I might be able to get something done now, but I'd need to know what. 
2018-04-06 15:31:34	ajshryoc	Crazy eights could use some more refactoring if you're up for that. I think pulling out the UI components to another module would clean things up. I also think we should consider ways to get rid of the payload params for transitions and states. Maybe define a generic environment  (Game) that that state machine passes around and the guards/state functions all know about. Not sure how hard that would be to implement 
2018-04-06 16:08:02	Jesse	Sorry I'm getting distracted playing with my raspberry pi. I'll try to work on that a lil later today. 
2018-04-06 16:28:15	ajshryoc	No problem. Was just a suggestion for where to go from here 
2018-04-07 10:17:49	Jesse	passing around the game environment would be a little bit of a pain, but I think it's doable. I'll see if I can refactor crazy eights a bit more before I try to do the environment thing. 
2018-04-07 10:26:08	Jesse	why does crazy eights have a makeMove FSM? 
2018-04-07 10:26:15	Jesse	it seems redundant 
2018-04-07 10:31:20	Jesse	also it looks like someone was trying to undo my Logger.log methods and just put the string in input(). we cannot do this because then that input string will not be in our log.txt

2018-02-20 13:08:42	jwstanl3	The rules from Bicycle didn't have any restrictions on color. It just had to be consecutive. But, yea, normally you would alternate colors, and it would be pretty easy to switch the program to follow that. 
2018-02-20 13:09:15	jwstanl3	The game's really easy at the moment, so adding something like that would help it be more challenging.

2018-02-21 20:28:57	jwstanl3	I pushed some fixes to my solitaire code. Cards have to alternate in color now in the stacks. There were a few other bugs I fixed. I still haven't added a win state, or a loss state really, but it should be able to detect a win or loss, if the loss state doesn't have any moves left. I haven't been able to beat the game since adding the alternating colors, so I'm not sure if this is true or not.

2018-02-22 22:08:38	ajshryoc	Added what I have for crazy eights. I think the only major feature missing is the suit change when playing an 8. I also intend to clean up the code and little bit to get rid of redundancy.  (edited)
2018-02-22 22:12:02	Jesse	great!! I'll probably take a look some time this weekend

2018-02-24 12:28:32	Jesse	Do you guys understand python decorators? I haven't been able to reproduce a function that demonstrates the difference with/without the decorator. 
2018-02-25 20:28:31	ajshryoc	Sorry, intended to respond, then totally forgot about this. My understanding of python decorators is it's just another form of syntax for calling functions; however, it sort of ties two functions together and modifies the function being decorated. Here's an article I found that gives a good explanation on the subject: http://python-3-patterns-idioms-test.readthedocs.io/en/latest/PythonDecorators.html

2018-02-25 22:39:22	ajshryoc	Just pushed the finished version of Crazy Eights. It's kinda a mess, so I'll probably do some refactoring of it at some point. I also modified cards.py to print out the unicode symbol corresponding to the card's suit. I was curious about how to do it and it turned out to be really easy, so I added it. I think it makes it much easier to see the cards 
2018-02-25 22:41:04	Jesse	oh nice!!! let me know if theres anything youd like me to change.  
2018-02-26 13:50:38	Jesse	I played both crazy eights and solitaire and I haven't noticed any bugs. winning looks good as well. 
2018-02-26 13:52:31	Jesse	we may be able to polish a few things up but honestly, it doesn't matter too much because we'll be taking parts of our code out and re implementing stuff for the second submission. I think what we have is gold. If there's anything you guys want me to change, just let me know.

2018-03-16 10:06:54	Jesse	I'm gonna take a look now about what we can do to our project for submission 3. 
2018-03-16 10:13:12	Jesse	Nobody but me used cardsTest.py right? would you guys mind if I deleted that file? 
2018-03-16 10:17:46	Jesse	We may want to ask the professor about this... I worry our games are too different. 
2018-03-17 00:11:58	ajshryoc	You can delete cardsTest.py if no one is using it. I would probably make a new directory in the git repo called 'project3' or something so that we have a record of both of our submissions. As for the issues with the games, if you want to ask him, go ahead. I think we could make it work but I'm sure he could provide some insight. <--- Sorry typed this up about 14 hours ago and never hit send 
2018-03-19 14:19:24	Jesse	We got a 90% it seems on what we submitted for the project. He said he liked our nouns/verbs but was disappointed that we didn't make an FSM. He also linked "Derive Interfaces from Constraints of Data" as if its some reading on moodle or github. 
2018-03-19 14:19:57	Jesse	... I checked both, and I'm not sure what he's talking about 
2018-03-19 14:36:38	ajshryoc	I'm also unsure what he meant by that. Our design did get a shoutout in #proj2_mar1 though so that's pretty cool 
2018-03-19 14:38:04	Jesse	i didn't see that. that is pretty cool 
2018-03-19 14:38:44	ajshryoc	Also, just realized the section the he references is also in that Google doc with the feedback 
2018-03-19 15:03:59	jwstanl3	Even after looking at that section, I'm still not sure what he wants us to get from that. The lines he references are where the suits are printed in Crazy Eights to allow the user to select which suit to change to. I don't get how that could be changed. 
2018-03-19 16:30:23	ajshryoc	It could definitely be made better. I think the whole system, crazy eights especially, could benefit from state machines. I intended to cleanup some of that code, but I decided to just wait until this upcoming submission. I'll take a better look at the comments later 
2018-03-19 17:59:01	Jesse	I'm not sure I know how the system could be improved with FSMs. But if you know what you'd like to change, I could definitely help out with that. The issue I see with FSMs is that only crazy eights would use it... and it would just be wasted code for solitaire. 
2018-03-19 19:10:58	ajshryoc	I'm sure he'll provide more context tomorrow. I'll review their comments too and we can go from there 
2018-03-20 10:11:37	Jesse	Hey guys, I was checking out a few other peoples code, and i found one where they built the FSM setup stuff, and didn't call it anywhere in their code xD. I wonder if the graders caught it.

2018-03-28 20:46:28	Jesse	I get what you mean, and I tried coding that up last night, but I'm struggling with what should be classes vs methods vs variables, and how should all of these things be linked up together?   
2018-03-28 20:49:16	Jesse	I guess the obvious answer would be to have all states and transitions be their own classes... but it also doesn't make sense for them to be their own classes when they might only have one variable or one method... and if the method just says pass, it doesn't really make sense to even have that method... 
2018-03-28 20:50:07	Jesse	And so you take the approach of having strings be states and methods being transitions... which is exactly how our code is now.. 
2018-03-28 20:50:32	Jesse	That's where my confusion with this project is. 
2018-03-28 20:52:56	ajshryoc	Yes, you're right and I'm not 100% sure how this implementation would work either. But, a lot of that I think could be solved by how it's implemented. For example, the State class could have a default implementation of each of its methods that is just "pass", that way, if you don't need the method, you don't worry about it. 
2018-03-28 20:55:40	ajshryoc	I think that Start, Play, Goal, and Fail could each be subclasses of State. When, as an example, Crazy Eights goes to instantiate a Start state, it should just have to pass in a lambda body that sets up the game. So, it wouldn't even need to subclass a new Start state (although it could). I think that it would look something like this: 
2018-03-28 20:55:45	ajshryoc	`start = new StartState(onEntry=setupCrazyEights)` 
2018-03-28 20:56:46	ajshryoc	`game.fsm = new FSM(start=start, play=runGame, end=endGame)` 
2018-03-28 20:57:07	ajshryoc	Or something like that. I may be oversimplifying things but I think it's doable 
2018-03-28 21:01:18	Jesse	I'll give it another shot tonight and let you know how it ends up tomorrow 
2018-03-28 21:02:43	ajshryoc	Okay, I will take a look at it too 
2018-03-28 21:24:44	Jesse	@Jesse uploaded a file: https://plm18.slack.com/files/U8N7VJU30/F9Z06TD0X/fsm.py (fsm) 
2018-03-28 21:24:51	Jesse	does that look like a good start? 
2018-03-28 21:32:03	Jesse	I really like the idea of passing in lambda bodies to abstract functions... that solved some of my 'why' questions earlier.. but its still kinda confusin  
2018-03-28 21:32:17	ajshryoc	Yeah, I think so. For the lambdas you pass in, you should just be able to pass in a function that performs the 'move' operation  (edited)
2018-03-28 21:32:36	ajshryoc	But, yeah I agree it is a little confusing 
2018-03-28 21:59:24	Jesse	nevermind, this whole thing seems stupid again... its like we're just making 4 methods for the sake of calling the same methods we would have initially. We pass the functions into some abstract class which just calls those methods in the abstract class... why not just call the functions? 
2018-03-28 22:04:45	Jesse	This whole process isn't saving us any lines of code... and as far as run-time and memory goes, this is more inefficient than what we've coded. It's even more unreadable too since theres more files for future programmers to go through. 
2018-03-28 23:14:21	ajshryoc	I'm working through a test version of crazy eights using an FSM, so hopefully that will help clear things up (if it works) 
2018-04-02 16:59:46	Jesse	Would either of you be free tonight to work on the plm stuff? or at least be free to instruct me on how I can help with the plm stuff? (since I haven't been very helpful so far) 
2018-04-02 17:32:35	ajshryoc	I am not free tonight to meet, but I should be able to push a working version of Crazy Eights with the FSM. Hopefully that will clear things up on how to implement the games with an FSM. Do you have ideas on things to change other than re-implementing the games with an FSM? 
2018-04-02 17:53:32	Jesse	not really, but we also have a paper we have to write. If I cannot find any improvements to the code, I'll try to get started on that.

2018-04-02 18:49:50	ajshryoc	I committed what I have so far to the other branch. You're welcome to take a look at it and continue developing it if that interests you. My approach so far has been to shove as much of what we already had as possible into the FSM. When I get back later, I will probably start rebuilding some of the functions passed into the FSM from the ground up to get rid of any issues I am just completely overlooking from our first iteration  (edited)
2018-04-02 19:10:11	Jesse	I think I'm going to get all of the non-fsm stuff into the CrazyEights.py file so it can be a lil more organized.

2018-04-02 20:17:07	ajshryoc	I like that idea. I was originally going to just have two versions of Crazy Eights until I got the FSM one working and then copy that over into CrazyEights.py, but I like your separation of logic here. I think at the very least we could label the FSM specification as the "domain specific language" he's looking for especially now that it's separated. 
2018-04-02 20:17:52	ajshryoc	Like I said before, I'm going to try re-writing the game logic to make it better-suited to the FSM to hopefully get rid of the bugs

2018-04-02 20:20:56	Jesse	im trying to have everything output to a log file. it's just annoying because of how python handles inheritance 
2018-04-02 20:29:47	Jesse	the stupidly annoying thing about the log file is that every object needs one, and I can't open the same file multiple times without problems I don't think. 
2018-04-02 20:35:00	Jesse	i just undid my changes. You're free to edit it 
2018-04-02 20:35:22	ajshryoc	I'm unfamiliar with logs in python. Is there a specific package for it that giving you trouble or just using file i/o? 
2018-04-02 20:35:46	Jesse	I tried both  
2018-04-02 20:37:07	Jesse	either way, it would make us have a ton of duplicated code if we tried to put it in there.

2018-04-03 20:40:19	Jesse	ok. sorry if I merged the PR too soon 
2018-04-03 20:47:53	ajshryoc	Nah, you're all good  (edited)
2018-04-03 20:50:13	ajshryoc	I'll merge locally and push that 
2018-04-03 20:50:25	Jesse	cool 
2018-04-03 20:54:48	ajshryoc	I was actually wrong---I had pushed all my changes before class and your pull request merged everything. So, crazy-eights-fsm is up to date. I will merge that into master and we can work from there

2018-04-03 21:06:37	Jesse	sounds good 
2018-04-03 21:10:12	ajshryoc	Got it working for crazy eights. Do you want me to make the changes to solitaire too, or just push what I've got? Me making the changes might result in merge conflicts. All you should have to do is remove your "unused" parameters from any function that takes one 
2018-04-03 21:11:06	Jesse	you can make the changes to solitaire. I'm working out some changes that I'll probably need to revert anyway.

2018-04-06 15:23:12	Jesse	hey guys, what other changes were you guys wanting to add to the project. I might be able to get something done now, but I'd need to know what. 
2018-04-06 15:31:34	ajshryoc	Crazy eights could use some more refactoring if you're up for that. I think pulling out the UI components to another module would clean things up. I also think we should consider ways to get rid of the payload params for transitions and states. Maybe define a generic environment  (Game) that that state machine passes around and the guards/state functions all know about. Not sure how hard that would be to implement 
2018-04-06 16:08:02	Jesse	Sorry I'm getting distracted playing with my raspberry pi. I'll try to work on that a lil later today. 
2018-04-06 16:28:15	ajshryoc	No problem. Was just a suggestion for where to go from here 
2018-04-07 10:17:49	Jesse	passing around the game environment would be a little bit of a pain, but I think it's doable. I'll see if I can refactor crazy eights a bit more before I try to do the environment thing. 
2018-04-07 10:26:08	Jesse	why does crazy eights have a makeMove FSM? 
2018-04-07 10:26:15	Jesse	it seems redundant 
2018-04-07 10:31:20	Jesse	also it looks like someone was trying to undo my Logger.log methods and just put the string in input(). we cannot do this because then that input string will not be in our log.txt

2018-02-21 20:28:57	jwstanl3	I pushed some fixes to my solitaire code. Cards have to alternate in color now in the stacks. There were a few other bugs I fixed. I still haven't added a win state, or a loss state really, but it should be able to detect a win or loss, if the loss state doesn't have any moves left. I haven't been able to beat the game since adding the alternating colors, so I'm not sure if this is true or not.

2018-02-23 10:52:41	Jesse	thanks! 
2018-02-24 12:28:32	Jesse	Do you guys understand python decorators? I haven't been able to reproduce a function that demonstrates the difference with/without the decorator. 
2018-02-25 20:28:31	ajshryoc	Sorry, intended to respond, then totally forgot about this. My understanding of python decorators is it's just another form of syntax for calling functions; however, it sort of ties two functions together and modifies the function being decorated. Here's an article I found that gives a good explanation on the subject: http://python-3-patterns-idioms-test.readthedocs.io/en/latest/PythonDecorators.html

2018-02-25 22:39:22	ajshryoc	Just pushed the finished version of Crazy Eights. It's kinda a mess, so I'll probably do some refactoring of it at some point. I also modified cards.py to print out the unicode symbol corresponding to the card's suit. I was curious about how to do it and it turned out to be really easy, so I added it. I think it makes it much easier to see the cards 
2018-02-25 22:41:04	Jesse	oh nice!!! let me know if theres anything youd like me to change.  
2018-02-26 13:50:38	Jesse	I played both crazy eights and solitaire and I haven't noticed any bugs. winning looks good as well. 
2018-02-26 13:52:31	Jesse	we may be able to polish a few things up but honestly, it doesn't matter too much because we'll be taking parts of our code out and re implementing stuff for the second submission. I think what we have is gold. If there's anything you guys want me to change, just let me know. 
2018-02-26 17:12:29	ajshryoc	Glad you liked it! I think they both play pretty well 
2018-03-12 13:07:36	Jesse	Hey guys, we need to figure out what we need to submit and submit it before class tomorrow. 
2018-03-12 13:11:03	Jesse	Do you guys have the transcript of the 2 games? if not I can make them. 
2018-03-12 13:12:50	ajshryoc	I don't have a transcript. You should be able to use the tee command to output to a file and stdout 
2018-03-12 13:13:04	Jesse	I was just gonna use script 
2018-03-12 13:13:18	Jesse	it automatically outputs the log to a file 
2018-03-12 13:13:31	ajshryoc	Yeah, whatever works

2018-03-16 10:06:54	Jesse	I'm gonna take a look now about what we can do to our project for submission 3. 
2018-03-16 10:13:12	Jesse	Nobody but me used cardsTest.py right? would you guys mind if I deleted that file? 
2018-03-16 10:17:46	Jesse	We may want to ask the professor about this... I worry our games are too different. 
2018-03-17 00:11:58	ajshryoc	You can delete cardsTest.py if no one is using it. I would probably make a new directory in the git repo called 'project3' or something so that we have a record of both of our submissions. As for the issues with the games, if you want to ask him, go ahead. I think we could make it work but I'm sure he could provide some insight. <--- Sorry typed this up about 14 hours ago and never hit send 
2018-03-19 14:19:24	Jesse	We got a 90% it seems on what we submitted for the project. He said he liked our nouns/verbs but was disappointed that we didn't make an FSM. He also linked "Derive Interfaces from Constraints of Data" as if its some reading on moodle or github. 
2018-03-19 14:19:57	Jesse	... I checked both, and I'm not sure what he's talking about 
2018-03-19 14:36:38	ajshryoc	I'm also unsure what he meant by that. Our design did get a shoutout in #proj2_mar1 though so that's pretty cool 
2018-03-19 14:38:04	Jesse	i didn't see that. that is pretty cool 
2018-03-19 14:38:44	ajshryoc	Also, just realized the section the he references is also in that Google doc with the feedback 
2018-03-19 15:03:59	jwstanl3	Even after looking at that section, I'm still not sure what he wants us to get from that. The lines he references are where the suits are printed in Crazy Eights to allow the user to select which suit to change to. I don't get how that could be changed. 
2018-03-19 16:30:23	ajshryoc	It could definitely be made better. I think the whole system, crazy eights especially, could benefit from state machines. I intended to cleanup some of that code, but I decided to just wait until this upcoming submission. I'll take a better look at the comments later 
2018-03-19 17:59:01	Jesse	I'm not sure I know how the system could be improved with FSMs. But if you know what you'd like to change, I could definitely help out with that. The issue I see with FSMs is that only crazy eights would use it... and it would just be wasted code for solitaire. 
2018-03-19 19:10:58	ajshryoc	I'm sure he'll provide more context tomorrow. I'll review their comments too and we can go from there 
2018-03-20 10:11:37	Jesse	Hey guys, I was checking out a few other peoples code, and i found one where they built the FSM setup stuff, and didn't call it anywhere in their code xD. I wonder if the graders caught it.

2018-03-28 20:46:28	Jesse	I get what you mean, and I tried coding that up last night, but I'm struggling with what should be classes vs methods vs variables, and how should all of these things be linked up together?   
2018-03-28 20:49:16	Jesse	I guess the obvious answer would be to have all states and transitions be their own classes... but it also doesn't make sense for them to be their own classes when they might only have one variable or one method... and if the method just says pass, it doesn't really make sense to even have that method... 
2018-03-28 20:50:07	Jesse	And so you take the approach of having strings be states and methods being transitions... which is exactly how our code is now.. 
2018-03-28 20:50:32	Jesse	That's where my confusion with this project is. 
2018-03-28 20:52:56	ajshryoc	Yes, you're right and I'm not 100% sure how this implementation would work either. But, a lot of that I think could be solved by how it's implemented. For example, the State class could have a default implementation of each of its methods that is just "pass", that way, if you don't need the method, you don't worry about it. 
2018-03-28 20:55:40	ajshryoc	I think that Start, Play, Goal, and Fail could each be subclasses of State. When, as an example, Crazy Eights goes to instantiate a Start state, it should just have to pass in a lambda body that sets up the game. So, it wouldn't even need to subclass a new Start state (although it could). I think that it would look something like this: 
2018-03-28 20:55:45	ajshryoc	`start = new StartState(onEntry=setupCrazyEights)` 
2018-03-28 20:56:46	ajshryoc	`game.fsm = new FSM(start=start, play=runGame, end=endGame)` 
2018-03-28 20:57:07	ajshryoc	Or something like that. I may be oversimplifying things but I think it's doable 
2018-03-28 21:01:18	Jesse	I'll give it another shot tonight and let you know how it ends up tomorrow 
2018-03-28 21:02:43	ajshryoc	Okay, I will take a look at it too 
2018-03-28 21:24:44	Jesse	@Jesse uploaded a file: https://plm18.slack.com/files/U8N7VJU30/F9Z06TD0X/fsm.py (fsm) 
2018-03-28 21:24:51	Jesse	does that look like a good start? 
2018-03-28 21:32:03	Jesse	I really like the idea of passing in lambda bodies to abstract functions... that solved some of my 'why' questions earlier.. but its still kinda confusin  
2018-03-28 21:32:17	ajshryoc	Yeah, I think so. For the lambdas you pass in, you should just be able to pass in a function that performs the 'move' operation  (edited)
2018-03-28 21:32:36	ajshryoc	But, yeah I agree it is a little confusing 
2018-03-28 21:59:24	Jesse	nevermind, this whole thing seems stupid again... its like we're just making 4 methods for the sake of calling the same methods we would have initially. We pass the functions into some abstract class which just calls those methods in the abstract class... why not just call the functions? 
2018-03-28 22:04:45	Jesse	This whole process isn't saving us any lines of code... and as far as run-time and memory goes, this is more inefficient than what we've coded. It's even more unreadable too since theres more files for future programmers to go through. 
2018-03-28 23:14:21	ajshryoc	I'm working through a test version of crazy eights using an FSM, so hopefully that will help clear things up (if it works) 
2018-04-02 16:59:46	Jesse	Would either of you be free tonight to work on the plm stuff? or at least be free to instruct me on how I can help with the plm stuff? (since I haven't been very helpful so far) 
2018-04-02 17:32:35	ajshryoc	I am not free tonight to meet, but I should be able to push a working version of Crazy Eights with the FSM. Hopefully that will clear things up on how to implement the games with an FSM. Do you have ideas on things to change other than re-implementing the games with an FSM? 
2018-04-02 17:53:32	Jesse	not really, but we also have a paper we have to write. If I cannot find any improvements to the code, I'll try to get started on that.

2018-04-02 18:49:50	ajshryoc	I committed what I have so far to the other branch. You're welcome to take a look at it and continue developing it if that interests you. My approach so far has been to shove as much of what we already had as possible into the FSM. When I get back later, I will probably start rebuilding some of the functions passed into the FSM from the ground up to get rid of any issues I am just completely overlooking from our first iteration  (edited)
2018-04-02 19:10:11	Jesse	I think I'm going to get all of the non-fsm stuff into the CrazyEights.py file so it can be a lil more organized.

2018-04-02 20:17:07	ajshryoc	I like that idea. I was originally going to just have two versions of Crazy Eights until I got the FSM one working and then copy that over into CrazyEights.py, but I like your separation of logic here. I think at the very least we could label the FSM specification as the "domain specific language" he's looking for especially now that it's separated. 
2018-04-02 20:17:52	ajshryoc	Like I said before, I'm going to try re-writing the game logic to make it better-suited to the FSM to hopefully get rid of the bugs

2018-04-02 20:20:56	Jesse	im trying to have everything output to a log file. it's just annoying because of how python handles inheritance 
2018-04-02 20:29:47	Jesse	the stupidly annoying thing about the log file is that every object needs one, and I can't open the same file multiple times without problems I don't think. 
2018-04-02 20:35:00	Jesse	i just undid my changes. You're free to edit it 
2018-04-02 20:35:22	ajshryoc	I'm unfamiliar with logs in python. Is there a specific package for it that giving you trouble or just using file i/o? 
2018-04-02 20:35:46	Jesse	I tried both  
2018-04-02 20:37:07	Jesse	either way, it would make us have a ton of duplicated code if we tried to put it in there.

2018-04-02 20:56:14	ajshryoc	Okay, how do you want to get the FSM code? I could merge to master or you could branch off of crazy-eights-fsm 
2018-04-02 20:57:07	Jesse	ill just branch off crazy-eights-fsm

2018-04-06 15:23:12	Jesse	hey guys, what other changes were you guys wanting to add to the project. I might be able to get something done now, but I'd need to know what. 
2018-04-06 15:31:34	ajshryoc	Crazy eights could use some more refactoring if you're up for that. I think pulling out the UI components to another module would clean things up. I also think we should consider ways to get rid of the payload params for transitions and states. Maybe define a generic environment  (Game) that that state machine passes around and the guards/state functions all know about. Not sure how hard that would be to implement 
2018-04-06 16:08:02	Jesse	Sorry I'm getting distracted playing with my raspberry pi. I'll try to work on that a lil later today. 
2018-04-06 16:28:15	ajshryoc	No problem. Was just a suggestion for where to go from here 
2018-04-07 10:17:49	Jesse	passing around the game environment would be a little bit of a pain, but I think it's doable. I'll see if I can refactor crazy eights a bit more before I try to do the environment thing. 
2018-04-07 10:26:08	Jesse	why does crazy eights have a makeMove FSM? 
2018-04-07 10:26:15	Jesse	it seems redundant 
2018-04-07 10:31:20	Jesse	also it looks like someone was trying to undo my Logger.log methods and just put the string in input(). we cannot do this because then that input string will not be in our log.txt

2018-04-07 16:57:26	Jesse	I tried converting a lot of the Transition statements and State creation methods into a for loop, but to be honest, it didn't save me many lines of code, and had bugs that I couldn't figure out why it was happening. 
2018-04-07 16:58:54	Jesse	It seemed like it would've been a good idea since it's repetitive code, but it made it much harder to read. 
2018-04-07 17:00:51	Jesse	I've looked a lil into passing around a game object, but we would need to have a bunch of variables keeping track of who the current player is and who the next player is... the whole process seemed like it would defeat the purpose of the FSM andrew made.

2018-02-21 20:28:57	jwstanl3	I pushed some fixes to my solitaire code. Cards have to alternate in color now in the stacks. There were a few other bugs I fixed. I still haven't added a win state, or a loss state really, but it should be able to detect a win or loss, if the loss state doesn't have any moves left. I haven't been able to beat the game since adding the alternating colors, so I'm not sure if this is true or not.

2018-02-22 22:08:38	ajshryoc	Added what I have for crazy eights. I think the only major feature missing is the suit change when playing an 8. I also intend to clean up the code and little bit to get rid of redundancy.  (edited)

2018-02-24 12:28:32	Jesse	Do you guys understand python decorators? I haven't been able to reproduce a function that demonstrates the difference with/without the decorator. 
2018-02-25 20:28:31	ajshryoc	Sorry, intended to respond, then totally forgot about this. My understanding of python decorators is it's just another form of syntax for calling functions; however, it sort of ties two functions together and modifies the function being decorated. Here's an article I found that gives a good explanation on the subject: http://python-3-patterns-idioms-test.readthedocs.io/en/latest/PythonDecorators.html

2018-02-25 22:39:22	ajshryoc	Just pushed the finished version of Crazy Eights. It's kinda a mess, so I'll probably do some refactoring of it at some point. I also modified cards.py to print out the unicode symbol corresponding to the card's suit. I was curious about how to do it and it turned out to be really easy, so I added it. I think it makes it much easier to see the cards 
2018-02-25 22:41:04	Jesse	oh nice!!! let me know if theres anything youd like me to change.  
2018-02-26 13:50:38	Jesse	I played both crazy eights and solitaire and I haven't noticed any bugs. winning looks good as well. 
2018-02-26 13:52:31	Jesse	we may be able to polish a few things up but honestly, it doesn't matter too much because we'll be taking parts of our code out and re implementing stuff for the second submission. I think what we have is gold. If there's anything you guys want me to change, just let me know. 
2018-02-26 17:12:29	ajshryoc	Glad you liked it! I think they both play pretty well

2018-03-12 13:11:03	Jesse	Do you guys have the transcript of the 2 games? if not I can make them. 
2018-03-12 13:12:50	ajshryoc	I don't have a transcript. You should be able to use the tee command to output to a file and stdout 
2018-03-12 13:13:04	Jesse	I was just gonna use script 
2018-03-12 13:13:18	Jesse	it automatically outputs the log to a file

2018-03-16 10:06:54	Jesse	I'm gonna take a look now about what we can do to our project for submission 3. 
2018-03-16 10:13:12	Jesse	Nobody but me used cardsTest.py right? would you guys mind if I deleted that file? 
2018-03-16 10:17:46	Jesse	We may want to ask the professor about this... I worry our games are too different. 
2018-03-17 00:11:58	ajshryoc	You can delete cardsTest.py if no one is using it. I would probably make a new directory in the git repo called 'project3' or something so that we have a record of both of our submissions. As for the issues with the games, if you want to ask him, go ahead. I think we could make it work but I'm sure he could provide some insight. <--- Sorry typed this up about 14 hours ago and never hit send 
2018-03-19 14:19:24	Jesse	We got a 90% it seems on what we submitted for the project. He said he liked our nouns/verbs but was disappointed that we didn't make an FSM. He also linked "Derive Interfaces from Constraints of Data" as if its some reading on moodle or github. 
2018-03-19 14:19:57	Jesse	... I checked both, and I'm not sure what he's talking about 
2018-03-19 14:36:38	ajshryoc	I'm also unsure what he meant by that. Our design did get a shoutout in #proj2_mar1 though so that's pretty cool 
2018-03-19 14:38:04	Jesse	i didn't see that. that is pretty cool 
2018-03-19 14:38:44	ajshryoc	Also, just realized the section the he references is also in that Google doc with the feedback 
2018-03-19 15:03:59	jwstanl3	Even after looking at that section, I'm still not sure what he wants us to get from that. The lines he references are where the suits are printed in Crazy Eights to allow the user to select which suit to change to. I don't get how that could be changed. 
2018-03-19 16:30:23	ajshryoc	It could definitely be made better. I think the whole system, crazy eights especially, could benefit from state machines. I intended to cleanup some of that code, but I decided to just wait until this upcoming submission. I'll take a better look at the comments later 
2018-03-19 17:59:01	Jesse	I'm not sure I know how the system could be improved with FSMs. But if you know what you'd like to change, I could definitely help out with that. The issue I see with FSMs is that only crazy eights would use it... and it would just be wasted code for solitaire. 
2018-03-19 19:10:58	ajshryoc	I'm sure he'll provide more context tomorrow. I'll review their comments too and we can go from there 
2018-03-20 10:11:37	Jesse	Hey guys, I was checking out a few other peoples code, and i found one where they built the FSM setup stuff, and didn't call it anywhere in their code xD. I wonder if the graders caught it.

2018-03-28 20:46:28	Jesse	I get what you mean, and I tried coding that up last night, but I'm struggling with what should be classes vs methods vs variables, and how should all of these things be linked up together?   
2018-03-28 20:49:16	Jesse	I guess the obvious answer would be to have all states and transitions be their own classes... but it also doesn't make sense for them to be their own classes when they might only have one variable or one method... and if the method just says pass, it doesn't really make sense to even have that method... 
2018-03-28 20:50:07	Jesse	And so you take the approach of having strings be states and methods being transitions... which is exactly how our code is now.. 
2018-03-28 20:50:32	Jesse	That's where my confusion with this project is. 
2018-03-28 20:52:56	ajshryoc	Yes, you're right and I'm not 100% sure how this implementation would work either. But, a lot of that I think could be solved by how it's implemented. For example, the State class could have a default implementation of each of its methods that is just "pass", that way, if you don't need the method, you don't worry about it. 
2018-03-28 20:55:40	ajshryoc	I think that Start, Play, Goal, and Fail could each be subclasses of State. When, as an example, Crazy Eights goes to instantiate a Start state, it should just have to pass in a lambda body that sets up the game. So, it wouldn't even need to subclass a new Start state (although it could). I think that it would look something like this: 
2018-03-28 20:55:45	ajshryoc	`start = new StartState(onEntry=setupCrazyEights)` 
2018-03-28 20:56:46	ajshryoc	`game.fsm = new FSM(start=start, play=runGame, end=endGame)` 
2018-03-28 20:57:07	ajshryoc	Or something like that. I may be oversimplifying things but I think it's doable 
2018-03-28 21:01:18	Jesse	I'll give it another shot tonight and let you know how it ends up tomorrow 
2018-03-28 21:02:43	ajshryoc	Okay, I will take a look at it too 
2018-03-28 21:24:44	Jesse	@Jesse uploaded a file: https://plm18.slack.com/files/U8N7VJU30/F9Z06TD0X/fsm.py (fsm) 
2018-03-28 21:24:51	Jesse	does that look like a good start? 
2018-03-28 21:32:03	Jesse	I really like the idea of passing in lambda bodies to abstract functions... that solved some of my 'why' questions earlier.. but its still kinda confusin  
2018-03-28 21:32:17	ajshryoc	Yeah, I think so. For the lambdas you pass in, you should just be able to pass in a function that performs the 'move' operation  (edited)
2018-03-28 21:32:36	ajshryoc	But, yeah I agree it is a little confusing 
2018-03-28 21:59:24	Jesse	nevermind, this whole thing seems stupid again... its like we're just making 4 methods for the sake of calling the same methods we would have initially. We pass the functions into some abstract class which just calls those methods in the abstract class... why not just call the functions? 
2018-03-28 22:04:45	Jesse	This whole process isn't saving us any lines of code... and as far as run-time and memory goes, this is more inefficient than what we've coded. It's even more unreadable too since theres more files for future programmers to go through. 
2018-03-28 23:14:21	ajshryoc	I'm working through a test version of crazy eights using an FSM, so hopefully that will help clear things up (if it works) 
2018-04-02 16:59:46	Jesse	Would either of you be free tonight to work on the plm stuff? or at least be free to instruct me on how I can help with the plm stuff? (since I haven't been very helpful so far) 
2018-04-02 17:32:35	ajshryoc	I am not free tonight to meet, but I should be able to push a working version of Crazy Eights with the FSM. Hopefully that will clear things up on how to implement the games with an FSM. Do you have ideas on things to change other than re-implementing the games with an FSM? 
2018-04-02 17:53:32	Jesse	not really, but we also have a paper we have to write. If I cannot find any improvements to the code, I'll try to get started on that.

2018-04-02 18:49:50	ajshryoc	I committed what I have so far to the other branch. You're welcome to take a look at it and continue developing it if that interests you. My approach so far has been to shove as much of what we already had as possible into the FSM. When I get back later, I will probably start rebuilding some of the functions passed into the FSM from the ground up to get rid of any issues I am just completely overlooking from our first iteration  (edited)

2018-04-02 20:17:07	ajshryoc	I like that idea. I was originally going to just have two versions of Crazy Eights until I got the FSM one working and then copy that over into CrazyEights.py, but I like your separation of logic here. I think at the very least we could label the FSM specification as the "domain specific language" he's looking for especially now that it's separated. 
2018-04-02 20:17:52	ajshryoc	Like I said before, I'm going to try re-writing the game logic to make it better-suited to the FSM to hopefully get rid of the bugs 
2018-04-02 20:18:24	Jesse	ok. im makin some changes now so don't do anything big :P 
2018-04-02 20:19:16	ajshryoc	Okay, no problem. Anything specific you are looking at or I should avoid? 
2018-04-02 20:20:56	Jesse	im trying to have everything output to a log file. it's just annoying because of how python handles inheritance 
2018-04-02 20:29:47	Jesse	the stupidly annoying thing about the log file is that every object needs one, and I can't open the same file multiple times without problems I don't think. 
2018-04-02 20:35:00	Jesse	i just undid my changes. You're free to edit it 
2018-04-02 20:35:22	ajshryoc	I'm unfamiliar with logs in python. Is there a specific package for it that giving you trouble or just using file i/o? 
2018-04-02 20:35:46	Jesse	I tried both  
2018-04-02 20:37:07	Jesse	either way, it would make us have a ton of duplicated code if we tried to put it in there.  
2018-04-02 20:54:54	Jesse	im gonna try to implement the solitaire stuff like you have with the fsms 
2018-04-02 20:56:14	ajshryoc	Okay, how do you want to get the FSM code? I could merge to master or you could branch off of crazy-eights-fsm 
2018-04-02 20:57:07	Jesse	ill just branch off crazy-eights-fsm 
2018-04-02 21:59:48	Jesse	it doesn't look like the guards are being called. 
2018-04-02 21:59:50	Jesse	are they? 
2018-04-02 22:50:13	Jesse	theres some bugs in the solitaire fsm but its pretty much there. 
2018-04-02 23:14:14	Jesse	let me know if you guys are wanting to do the "bonus projects" that menzies just listed a couple hours ago. 
2018-04-02 23:51:15	ajshryoc	Yeah, they're being called for me. I accidentally was calling them in the state object declaration for awhile though because I had the syntax wrong 
2018-04-02 23:51:27	ajshryoc	I'll look more into the bonus projects tomorrow

2018-04-03 21:11:06	Jesse	you can make the changes to solitaire. I'm working out some changes that I'll probably need to revert anyway.

2018-04-06 15:23:12	Jesse	hey guys, what other changes were you guys wanting to add to the project. I might be able to get something done now, but I'd need to know what. 
2018-04-06 15:31:34	ajshryoc	Crazy eights could use some more refactoring if you're up for that. I think pulling out the UI components to another module would clean things up. I also think we should consider ways to get rid of the payload params for transitions and states. Maybe define a generic environment  (Game) that that state machine passes around and the guards/state functions all know about. Not sure how hard that would be to implement 
2018-04-06 16:08:02	Jesse	Sorry I'm getting distracted playing with my raspberry pi. I'll try to work on that a lil later today. 
2018-04-06 16:28:15	ajshryoc	No problem. Was just a suggestion for where to go from here 
2018-04-07 10:17:49	Jesse	passing around the game environment would be a little bit of a pain, but I think it's doable. I'll see if I can refactor crazy eights a bit more before I try to do the environment thing. 
2018-04-07 10:26:08	Jesse	why does crazy eights have a makeMove FSM?

2018-04-07 10:31:20	Jesse	also it looks like someone was trying to undo my Logger.log methods and just put the string in input(). we cannot do this because then that input string will not be in our log.txt

2018-04-07 16:57:26	Jesse	I tried converting a lot of the Transition statements and State creation methods into a for loop, but to be honest, it didn't save me many lines of code, and had bugs that I couldn't figure out why it was happening. 
2018-04-07 16:58:54	Jesse	It seemed like it would've been a good idea since it's repetitive code, but it made it much harder to read. 
2018-04-07 17:00:51	Jesse	I've looked a lil into passing around a game object, but we would need to have a bunch of variables keeping track of who the current player is and who the next player is... the whole process seemed like it would defeat the purpose of the FSM andrew made.

2018-02-21 20:28:57	jwstanl3	I pushed some fixes to my solitaire code. Cards have to alternate in color now in the stacks. There were a few other bugs I fixed. I still haven't added a win state, or a loss state really, but it should be able to detect a win or loss, if the loss state doesn't have any moves left. I haven't been able to beat the game since adding the alternating colors, so I'm not sure if this is true or not.

2018-02-22 22:08:38	ajshryoc	Added what I have for crazy eights. I think the only major feature missing is the suit change when playing an 8. I also intend to clean up the code and little bit to get rid of redundancy.  (edited)

2018-02-24 12:28:32	Jesse	Do you guys understand python decorators? I haven't been able to reproduce a function that demonstrates the difference with/without the decorator. 
2018-02-25 20:28:31	ajshryoc	Sorry, intended to respond, then totally forgot about this. My understanding of python decorators is it's just another form of syntax for calling functions; however, it sort of ties two functions together and modifies the function being decorated. Here's an article I found that gives a good explanation on the subject: http://python-3-patterns-idioms-test.readthedocs.io/en/latest/PythonDecorators.html

2018-02-25 22:39:22	ajshryoc	Just pushed the finished version of Crazy Eights. It's kinda a mess, so I'll probably do some refactoring of it at some point. I also modified cards.py to print out the unicode symbol corresponding to the card's suit. I was curious about how to do it and it turned out to be really easy, so I added it. I think it makes it much easier to see the cards 
2018-02-25 22:41:04	Jesse	oh nice!!! let me know if theres anything youd like me to change.  
2018-02-26 13:50:38	Jesse	I played both crazy eights and solitaire and I haven't noticed any bugs. winning looks good as well. 
2018-02-26 13:52:31	Jesse	we may be able to polish a few things up but honestly, it doesn't matter too much because we'll be taking parts of our code out and re implementing stuff for the second submission. I think what we have is gold. If there's anything you guys want me to change, just let me know. 
2018-02-26 17:12:29	ajshryoc	Glad you liked it! I think they both play pretty well

2018-03-12 13:12:50	ajshryoc	I don't have a transcript. You should be able to use the tee command to output to a file and stdout 
2018-03-12 13:13:04	Jesse	I was just gonna use script 
2018-03-12 13:13:18	Jesse	it automatically outputs the log to a file

2018-03-16 10:06:54	Jesse	I'm gonna take a look now about what we can do to our project for submission 3. 
2018-03-16 10:13:12	Jesse	Nobody but me used cardsTest.py right? would you guys mind if I deleted that file? 
2018-03-16 10:17:46	Jesse	We may want to ask the professor about this... I worry our games are too different. 
2018-03-17 00:11:58	ajshryoc	You can delete cardsTest.py if no one is using it. I would probably make a new directory in the git repo called 'project3' or something so that we have a record of both of our submissions. As for the issues with the games, if you want to ask him, go ahead. I think we could make it work but I'm sure he could provide some insight. <--- Sorry typed this up about 14 hours ago and never hit send 
2018-03-19 14:19:24	Jesse	We got a 90% it seems on what we submitted for the project. He said he liked our nouns/verbs but was disappointed that we didn't make an FSM. He also linked "Derive Interfaces from Constraints of Data" as if its some reading on moodle or github. 
2018-03-19 14:19:57	Jesse	... I checked both, and I'm not sure what he's talking about 
2018-03-19 14:36:38	ajshryoc	I'm also unsure what he meant by that. Our design did get a shoutout in #proj2_mar1 though so that's pretty cool 
2018-03-19 14:38:04	Jesse	i didn't see that. that is pretty cool 
2018-03-19 14:38:44	ajshryoc	Also, just realized the section the he references is also in that Google doc with the feedback 
2018-03-19 15:03:59	jwstanl3	Even after looking at that section, I'm still not sure what he wants us to get from that. The lines he references are where the suits are printed in Crazy Eights to allow the user to select which suit to change to. I don't get how that could be changed. 
2018-03-19 16:30:23	ajshryoc	It could definitely be made better. I think the whole system, crazy eights especially, could benefit from state machines. I intended to cleanup some of that code, but I decided to just wait until this upcoming submission. I'll take a better look at the comments later 
2018-03-19 17:59:01	Jesse	I'm not sure I know how the system could be improved with FSMs. But if you know what you'd like to change, I could definitely help out with that. The issue I see with FSMs is that only crazy eights would use it... and it would just be wasted code for solitaire. 
2018-03-19 19:10:58	ajshryoc	I'm sure he'll provide more context tomorrow. I'll review their comments too and we can go from there 
2018-03-20 10:11:37	Jesse	Hey guys, I was checking out a few other peoples code, and i found one where they built the FSM setup stuff, and didn't call it anywhere in their code xD. I wonder if the graders caught it.

2018-03-28 20:46:28	Jesse	I get what you mean, and I tried coding that up last night, but I'm struggling with what should be classes vs methods vs variables, and how should all of these things be linked up together?   
2018-03-28 20:49:16	Jesse	I guess the obvious answer would be to have all states and transitions be their own classes... but it also doesn't make sense for them to be their own classes when they might only have one variable or one method... and if the method just says pass, it doesn't really make sense to even have that method... 
2018-03-28 20:50:07	Jesse	And so you take the approach of having strings be states and methods being transitions... which is exactly how our code is now.. 
2018-03-28 20:50:32	Jesse	That's where my confusion with this project is. 
2018-03-28 20:52:56	ajshryoc	Yes, you're right and I'm not 100% sure how this implementation would work either. But, a lot of that I think could be solved by how it's implemented. For example, the State class could have a default implementation of each of its methods that is just "pass", that way, if you don't need the method, you don't worry about it. 
2018-03-28 20:55:40	ajshryoc	I think that Start, Play, Goal, and Fail could each be subclasses of State. When, as an example, Crazy Eights goes to instantiate a Start state, it should just have to pass in a lambda body that sets up the game. So, it wouldn't even need to subclass a new Start state (although it could). I think that it would look something like this: 
2018-03-28 20:55:45	ajshryoc	`start = new StartState(onEntry=setupCrazyEights)` 
2018-03-28 20:56:46	ajshryoc	`game.fsm = new FSM(start=start, play=runGame, end=endGame)` 
2018-03-28 20:57:07	ajshryoc	Or something like that. I may be oversimplifying things but I think it's doable 
2018-03-28 21:01:18	Jesse	I'll give it another shot tonight and let you know how it ends up tomorrow 
2018-03-28 21:02:43	ajshryoc	Okay, I will take a look at it too 
2018-03-28 21:24:44	Jesse	@Jesse uploaded a file: https://plm18.slack.com/files/U8N7VJU30/F9Z06TD0X/fsm.py (fsm) 
2018-03-28 21:24:51	Jesse	does that look like a good start? 
2018-03-28 21:32:03	Jesse	I really like the idea of passing in lambda bodies to abstract functions... that solved some of my 'why' questions earlier.. but its still kinda confusin  
2018-03-28 21:32:17	ajshryoc	Yeah, I think so. For the lambdas you pass in, you should just be able to pass in a function that performs the 'move' operation  (edited)
2018-03-28 21:32:36	ajshryoc	But, yeah I agree it is a little confusing 
2018-03-28 21:59:24	Jesse	nevermind, this whole thing seems stupid again... its like we're just making 4 methods for the sake of calling the same methods we would have initially. We pass the functions into some abstract class which just calls those methods in the abstract class... why not just call the functions? 
2018-03-28 22:04:45	Jesse	This whole process isn't saving us any lines of code... and as far as run-time and memory goes, this is more inefficient than what we've coded. It's even more unreadable too since theres more files for future programmers to go through. 
2018-03-28 23:14:21	ajshryoc	I'm working through a test version of crazy eights using an FSM, so hopefully that will help clear things up (if it works) 
2018-04-02 16:59:46	Jesse	Would either of you be free tonight to work on the plm stuff? or at least be free to instruct me on how I can help with the plm stuff? (since I haven't been very helpful so far) 
2018-04-02 17:32:35	ajshryoc	I am not free tonight to meet, but I should be able to push a working version of Crazy Eights with the FSM. Hopefully that will clear things up on how to implement the games with an FSM. Do you have ideas on things to change other than re-implementing the games with an FSM? 
2018-04-02 17:53:32	Jesse	not really, but we also have a paper we have to write. If I cannot find any improvements to the code, I'll try to get started on that.

2018-04-02 18:49:50	ajshryoc	I committed what I have so far to the other branch. You're welcome to take a look at it and continue developing it if that interests you. My approach so far has been to shove as much of what we already had as possible into the FSM. When I get back later, I will probably start rebuilding some of the functions passed into the FSM from the ground up to get rid of any issues I am just completely overlooking from our first iteration  (edited)
2018-04-02 19:10:11	Jesse	I think I'm going to get all of the non-fsm stuff into the CrazyEights.py file so it can be a lil more organized.

2018-04-02 20:17:07	ajshryoc	I like that idea. I was originally going to just have two versions of Crazy Eights until I got the FSM one working and then copy that over into CrazyEights.py, but I like your separation of logic here. I think at the very least we could label the FSM specification as the "domain specific language" he's looking for especially now that it's separated. 
2018-04-02 20:17:52	ajshryoc	Like I said before, I'm going to try re-writing the game logic to make it better-suited to the FSM to hopefully get rid of the bugs 
2018-04-02 20:18:24	Jesse	ok. im makin some changes now so don't do anything big :P 
2018-04-02 20:19:16	ajshryoc	Okay, no problem. Anything specific you are looking at or I should avoid? 
2018-04-02 20:20:56	Jesse	im trying to have everything output to a log file. it's just annoying because of how python handles inheritance 
2018-04-02 20:29:47	Jesse	the stupidly annoying thing about the log file is that every object needs one, and I can't open the same file multiple times without problems I don't think. 
2018-04-02 20:35:00	Jesse	i just undid my changes. You're free to edit it 
2018-04-02 20:35:22	ajshryoc	I'm unfamiliar with logs in python. Is there a specific package for it that giving you trouble or just using file i/o? 
2018-04-02 20:35:46	Jesse	I tried both  
2018-04-02 20:37:07	Jesse	either way, it would make us have a ton of duplicated code if we tried to put it in there.  
2018-04-02 20:54:54	Jesse	im gonna try to implement the solitaire stuff like you have with the fsms 
2018-04-02 20:56:14	ajshryoc	Okay, how do you want to get the FSM code? I could merge to master or you could branch off of crazy-eights-fsm 
2018-04-02 20:57:07	Jesse	ill just branch off crazy-eights-fsm 
2018-04-02 21:59:48	Jesse	it doesn't look like the guards are being called. 
2018-04-02 21:59:50	Jesse	are they? 
2018-04-02 22:50:13	Jesse	theres some bugs in the solitaire fsm but its pretty much there. 
2018-04-02 23:14:14	Jesse	let me know if you guys are wanting to do the "bonus projects" that menzies just listed a couple hours ago. 
2018-04-02 23:51:15	ajshryoc	Yeah, they're being called for me. I accidentally was calling them in the state object declaration for awhile though because I had the syntax wrong 
2018-04-02 23:51:27	ajshryoc	I'll look more into the bonus projects tomorrow

2018-04-06 15:23:12	Jesse	hey guys, what other changes were you guys wanting to add to the project. I might be able to get something done now, but I'd need to know what. 
2018-04-06 15:31:34	ajshryoc	Crazy eights could use some more refactoring if you're up for that. I think pulling out the UI components to another module would clean things up. I also think we should consider ways to get rid of the payload params for transitions and states. Maybe define a generic environment  (Game) that that state machine passes around and the guards/state functions all know about. Not sure how hard that would be to implement 
2018-04-06 16:08:02	Jesse	Sorry I'm getting distracted playing with my raspberry pi. I'll try to work on that a lil later today. 
2018-04-06 16:28:15	ajshryoc	No problem. Was just a suggestion for where to go from here 
2018-04-07 10:17:49	Jesse	passing around the game environment would be a little bit of a pain, but I think it's doable. I'll see if I can refactor crazy eights a bit more before I try to do the environment thing. 
2018-04-07 10:26:08	Jesse	why does crazy eights have a makeMove FSM? 
2018-04-07 10:26:15	Jesse	it seems redundant 
2018-04-07 10:31:20	Jesse	also it looks like someone was trying to undo my Logger.log methods and just put the string in input(). we cannot do this because then that input string will not be in our log.txt

2018-04-07 16:57:26	Jesse	I tried converting a lot of the Transition statements and State creation methods into a for loop, but to be honest, it didn't save me many lines of code, and had bugs that I couldn't figure out why it was happening. 
2018-04-07 16:58:54	Jesse	It seemed like it would've been a good idea since it's repetitive code, but it made it much harder to read. 
2018-04-07 17:00:51	Jesse	I've looked a lil into passing around a game object, but we would need to have a bunch of variables keeping track of who the current player is and who the next player is... the whole process seemed like it would defeat the purpose of the FSM andrew made.  
2018-04-10 12:05:22	Jesse	Hey Joseph, have you pushed the changes you were talking to me about on the bus? 
2018-04-10 12:07:47	Jesse	Also, I'll be available up until and after class to work on this if anyone wants to join me.

2018-02-22 22:08:38	ajshryoc	Added what I have for crazy eights. I think the only major feature missing is the suit change when playing an 8. I also intend to clean up the code and little bit to get rid of redundancy.  (edited)
2018-02-22 22:12:02	Jesse	great!! I'll probably take a look some time this weekend

2018-02-24 12:28:32	Jesse	Do you guys understand python decorators? I haven't been able to reproduce a function that demonstrates the difference with/without the decorator. 
2018-02-25 20:28:31	ajshryoc	Sorry, intended to respond, then totally forgot about this. My understanding of python decorators is it's just another form of syntax for calling functions; however, it sort of ties two functions together and modifies the function being decorated. Here's an article I found that gives a good explanation on the subject: http://python-3-patterns-idioms-test.readthedocs.io/en/latest/PythonDecorators.html

2018-02-25 22:39:22	ajshryoc	Just pushed the finished version of Crazy Eights. It's kinda a mess, so I'll probably do some refactoring of it at some point. I also modified cards.py to print out the unicode symbol corresponding to the card's suit. I was curious about how to do it and it turned out to be really easy, so I added it. I think it makes it much easier to see the cards 
2018-02-25 22:41:04	Jesse	oh nice!!! let me know if theres anything youd like me to change.  
2018-02-26 13:50:38	Jesse	I played both crazy eights and solitaire and I haven't noticed any bugs. winning looks good as well. 
2018-02-26 13:52:31	Jesse	we may be able to polish a few things up but honestly, it doesn't matter too much because we'll be taking parts of our code out and re implementing stuff for the second submission. I think what we have is gold. If there's anything you guys want me to change, just let me know. 
2018-02-26 17:12:29	ajshryoc	Glad you liked it! I think they both play pretty well

2018-03-12 13:11:03	Jesse	Do you guys have the transcript of the 2 games? if not I can make them. 
2018-03-12 13:12:50	ajshryoc	I don't have a transcript. You should be able to use the tee command to output to a file and stdout 
2018-03-12 13:13:04	Jesse	I was just gonna use script 
2018-03-12 13:13:18	Jesse	it automatically outputs the log to a file

2018-03-16 10:06:54	Jesse	I'm gonna take a look now about what we can do to our project for submission 3. 
2018-03-16 10:13:12	Jesse	Nobody but me used cardsTest.py right? would you guys mind if I deleted that file? 
2018-03-16 10:17:46	Jesse	We may want to ask the professor about this... I worry our games are too different. 
2018-03-17 00:11:58	ajshryoc	You can delete cardsTest.py if no one is using it. I would probably make a new directory in the git repo called 'project3' or something so that we have a record of both of our submissions. As for the issues with the games, if you want to ask him, go ahead. I think we could make it work but I'm sure he could provide some insight. <--- Sorry typed this up about 14 hours ago and never hit send 
2018-03-19 14:19:24	Jesse	We got a 90% it seems on what we submitted for the project. He said he liked our nouns/verbs but was disappointed that we didn't make an FSM. He also linked "Derive Interfaces from Constraints of Data" as if its some reading on moodle or github. 
2018-03-19 14:19:57	Jesse	... I checked both, and I'm not sure what he's talking about 
2018-03-19 14:36:38	ajshryoc	I'm also unsure what he meant by that. Our design did get a shoutout in #proj2_mar1 though so that's pretty cool 
2018-03-19 14:38:04	Jesse	i didn't see that. that is pretty cool 
2018-03-19 14:38:44	ajshryoc	Also, just realized the section the he references is also in that Google doc with the feedback 
2018-03-19 15:03:59	jwstanl3	Even after looking at that section, I'm still not sure what he wants us to get from that. The lines he references are where the suits are printed in Crazy Eights to allow the user to select which suit to change to. I don't get how that could be changed. 
2018-03-19 16:30:23	ajshryoc	It could definitely be made better. I think the whole system, crazy eights especially, could benefit from state machines. I intended to cleanup some of that code, but I decided to just wait until this upcoming submission. I'll take a better look at the comments later 
2018-03-19 17:59:01	Jesse	I'm not sure I know how the system could be improved with FSMs. But if you know what you'd like to change, I could definitely help out with that. The issue I see with FSMs is that only crazy eights would use it... and it would just be wasted code for solitaire. 
2018-03-19 19:10:58	ajshryoc	I'm sure he'll provide more context tomorrow. I'll review their comments too and we can go from there 
2018-03-20 10:11:37	Jesse	Hey guys, I was checking out a few other peoples code, and i found one where they built the FSM setup stuff, and didn't call it anywhere in their code xD. I wonder if the graders caught it.

2018-03-28 20:46:28	Jesse	I get what you mean, and I tried coding that up last night, but I'm struggling with what should be classes vs methods vs variables, and how should all of these things be linked up together?   
2018-03-28 20:49:16	Jesse	I guess the obvious answer would be to have all states and transitions be their own classes... but it also doesn't make sense for them to be their own classes when they might only have one variable or one method... and if the method just says pass, it doesn't really make sense to even have that method... 
2018-03-28 20:50:07	Jesse	And so you take the approach of having strings be states and methods being transitions... which is exactly how our code is now.. 
2018-03-28 20:50:32	Jesse	That's where my confusion with this project is. 
2018-03-28 20:52:56	ajshryoc	Yes, you're right and I'm not 100% sure how this implementation would work either. But, a lot of that I think could be solved by how it's implemented. For example, the State class could have a default implementation of each of its methods that is just "pass", that way, if you don't need the method, you don't worry about it. 
2018-03-28 20:55:40	ajshryoc	I think that Start, Play, Goal, and Fail could each be subclasses of State. When, as an example, Crazy Eights goes to instantiate a Start state, it should just have to pass in a lambda body that sets up the game. So, it wouldn't even need to subclass a new Start state (although it could). I think that it would look something like this: 
2018-03-28 20:55:45	ajshryoc	`start = new StartState(onEntry=setupCrazyEights)` 
2018-03-28 20:56:46	ajshryoc	`game.fsm = new FSM(start=start, play=runGame, end=endGame)` 
2018-03-28 20:57:07	ajshryoc	Or something like that. I may be oversimplifying things but I think it's doable 
2018-03-28 21:01:18	Jesse	I'll give it another shot tonight and let you know how it ends up tomorrow 
2018-03-28 21:02:43	ajshryoc	Okay, I will take a look at it too 
2018-03-28 21:24:44	Jesse	@Jesse uploaded a file: https://plm18.slack.com/files/U8N7VJU30/F9Z06TD0X/fsm.py (fsm) 
2018-03-28 21:24:51	Jesse	does that look like a good start? 
2018-03-28 21:32:03	Jesse	I really like the idea of passing in lambda bodies to abstract functions... that solved some of my 'why' questions earlier.. but its still kinda confusin  
2018-03-28 21:32:17	ajshryoc	Yeah, I think so. For the lambdas you pass in, you should just be able to pass in a function that performs the 'move' operation  (edited)
2018-03-28 21:32:36	ajshryoc	But, yeah I agree it is a little confusing 
2018-03-28 21:59:24	Jesse	nevermind, this whole thing seems stupid again... its like we're just making 4 methods for the sake of calling the same methods we would have initially. We pass the functions into some abstract class which just calls those methods in the abstract class... why not just call the functions? 
2018-03-28 22:04:45	Jesse	This whole process isn't saving us any lines of code... and as far as run-time and memory goes, this is more inefficient than what we've coded. It's even more unreadable too since theres more files for future programmers to go through. 
2018-03-28 23:14:21	ajshryoc	I'm working through a test version of crazy eights using an FSM, so hopefully that will help clear things up (if it works) 
2018-04-02 16:59:46	Jesse	Would either of you be free tonight to work on the plm stuff? or at least be free to instruct me on how I can help with the plm stuff? (since I haven't been very helpful so far) 
2018-04-02 17:32:35	ajshryoc	I am not free tonight to meet, but I should be able to push a working version of Crazy Eights with the FSM. Hopefully that will clear things up on how to implement the games with an FSM. Do you have ideas on things to change other than re-implementing the games with an FSM? 
2018-04-02 17:53:32	Jesse	not really, but we also have a paper we have to write. If I cannot find any improvements to the code, I'll try to get started on that.

2018-04-02 18:49:50	ajshryoc	I committed what I have so far to the other branch. You're welcome to take a look at it and continue developing it if that interests you. My approach so far has been to shove as much of what we already had as possible into the FSM. When I get back later, I will probably start rebuilding some of the functions passed into the FSM from the ground up to get rid of any issues I am just completely overlooking from our first iteration  (edited)
2018-04-02 19:10:11	Jesse	I think I'm going to get all of the non-fsm stuff into the CrazyEights.py file so it can be a lil more organized.

2018-04-02 20:17:07	ajshryoc	I like that idea. I was originally going to just have two versions of Crazy Eights until I got the FSM one working and then copy that over into CrazyEights.py, but I like your separation of logic here. I think at the very least we could label the FSM specification as the "domain specific language" he's looking for especially now that it's separated. 
2018-04-02 20:17:52	ajshryoc	Like I said before, I'm going to try re-writing the game logic to make it better-suited to the FSM to hopefully get rid of the bugs 
2018-04-02 20:18:24	Jesse	ok. im makin some changes now so don't do anything big :P 
2018-04-02 20:19:16	ajshryoc	Okay, no problem. Anything specific you are looking at or I should avoid? 
2018-04-02 20:20:56	Jesse	im trying to have everything output to a log file. it's just annoying because of how python handles inheritance 
2018-04-02 20:29:47	Jesse	the stupidly annoying thing about the log file is that every object needs one, and I can't open the same file multiple times without problems I don't think. 
2018-04-02 20:35:00	Jesse	i just undid my changes. You're free to edit it 
2018-04-02 20:35:22	ajshryoc	I'm unfamiliar with logs in python. Is there a specific package for it that giving you trouble or just using file i/o? 
2018-04-02 20:35:46	Jesse	I tried both  
2018-04-02 20:37:07	Jesse	either way, it would make us have a ton of duplicated code if we tried to put it in there.  
2018-04-02 20:54:54	Jesse	im gonna try to implement the solitaire stuff like you have with the fsms 
2018-04-02 20:56:14	ajshryoc	Okay, how do you want to get the FSM code? I could merge to master or you could branch off of crazy-eights-fsm 
2018-04-02 20:57:07	Jesse	ill just branch off crazy-eights-fsm 
2018-04-02 21:59:48	Jesse	it doesn't look like the guards are being called. 
2018-04-02 21:59:50	Jesse	are they? 
2018-04-02 22:50:13	Jesse	theres some bugs in the solitaire fsm but its pretty much there. 
2018-04-02 23:14:14	Jesse	let me know if you guys are wanting to do the "bonus projects" that menzies just listed a couple hours ago. 
2018-04-02 23:51:15	ajshryoc	Yeah, they're being called for me. I accidentally was calling them in the state object declaration for awhile though because I had the syntax wrong 
2018-04-02 23:51:27	ajshryoc	I'll look more into the bonus projects tomorrow

2018-04-05 19:13:21	Jesse	but it has an issue with the logger I made. 
2018-04-05 19:16:27	Jesse	got it workin 
2018-04-05 19:21:18	ajshryoc	Okay, good. Sorry about the issues

2018-04-06 15:23:12	Jesse	hey guys, what other changes were you guys wanting to add to the project. I might be able to get something done now, but I'd need to know what. 
2018-04-06 15:31:34	ajshryoc	Crazy eights could use some more refactoring if you're up for that. I think pulling out the UI components to another module would clean things up. I also think we should consider ways to get rid of the payload params for transitions and states. Maybe define a generic environment  (Game) that that state machine passes around and the guards/state functions all know about. Not sure how hard that would be to implement 
2018-04-06 16:08:02	Jesse	Sorry I'm getting distracted playing with my raspberry pi. I'll try to work on that a lil later today. 
2018-04-06 16:28:15	ajshryoc	No problem. Was just a suggestion for where to go from here 
2018-04-07 10:17:49	Jesse	passing around the game environment would be a little bit of a pain, but I think it's doable. I'll see if I can refactor crazy eights a bit more before I try to do the environment thing. 
2018-04-07 10:26:08	Jesse	why does crazy eights have a makeMove FSM? 
2018-04-07 10:26:15	Jesse	it seems redundant 
2018-04-07 10:31:20	Jesse	also it looks like someone was trying to undo my Logger.log methods and just put the string in input(). we cannot do this because then that input string will not be in our log.txt

2018-04-07 16:57:26	Jesse	I tried converting a lot of the Transition statements and State creation methods into a for loop, but to be honest, it didn't save me many lines of code, and had bugs that I couldn't figure out why it was happening. 
2018-04-07 16:58:54	Jesse	It seemed like it would've been a good idea since it's repetitive code, but it made it much harder to read. 
2018-04-07 17:00:51	Jesse	I've looked a lil into passing around a game object, but we would need to have a bunch of variables keeping track of who the current player is and who the next player is... the whole process seemed like it would defeat the purpose of the FSM andrew made.  
2018-04-10 12:05:22	Jesse	Hey Joseph, have you pushed the changes you were talking to me about on the bus? 
2018-04-10 12:07:47	Jesse	Also, I'll be available up until and after class to work on this if anyone wants to join me.

2018-04-10 12:32:44	jwstanl3	I pushed my work so far. I'm still working through the cards file to see what I can make concrete between the two games and what needs to be abstracted to subclasses. 
2018-04-10 12:34:29	Jesse	Thanks, I'm trying to make unit tests. 
2018-04-10 12:34:41	Jesse	although the import statements are a huge pain. 
2018-04-10 12:36:54	Jesse	I hate that python cares about what directory you're in whenever you start the program. 
2018-04-10 13:16:15	Jesse	I found a way to make all of our imports absolute rather than relative. We just have to make a virtual environment and give the users instructions to set it up.

2018-02-24 12:28:32	Jesse	Do you guys understand python decorators? I haven't been able to reproduce a function that demonstrates the difference with/without the decorator. 
2018-02-25 20:28:31	ajshryoc	Sorry, intended to respond, then totally forgot about this. My understanding of python decorators is it's just another form of syntax for calling functions; however, it sort of ties two functions together and modifies the function being decorated. Here's an article I found that gives a good explanation on the subject: http://python-3-patterns-idioms-test.readthedocs.io/en/latest/PythonDecorators.html

2018-02-25 22:39:22	ajshryoc	Just pushed the finished version of Crazy Eights. It's kinda a mess, so I'll probably do some refactoring of it at some point. I also modified cards.py to print out the unicode symbol corresponding to the card's suit. I was curious about how to do it and it turned out to be really easy, so I added it. I think it makes it much easier to see the cards 
2018-02-25 22:41:04	Jesse	oh nice!!! let me know if theres anything youd like me to change.  
2018-02-26 13:50:38	Jesse	I played both crazy eights and solitaire and I haven't noticed any bugs. winning looks good as well. 
2018-02-26 13:52:31	Jesse	we may be able to polish a few things up but honestly, it doesn't matter too much because we'll be taking parts of our code out and re implementing stuff for the second submission. I think what we have is gold. If there's anything you guys want me to change, just let me know. 
2018-02-26 17:12:29	ajshryoc	Glad you liked it! I think they both play pretty well

2018-03-12 13:12:50	ajshryoc	I don't have a transcript. You should be able to use the tee command to output to a file and stdout 
2018-03-12 13:13:04	Jesse	I was just gonna use script 
2018-03-12 13:13:18	Jesse	it automatically outputs the log to a file

2018-03-16 10:06:54	Jesse	I'm gonna take a look now about what we can do to our project for submission 3. 
2018-03-16 10:13:12	Jesse	Nobody but me used cardsTest.py right? would you guys mind if I deleted that file? 
2018-03-16 10:17:46	Jesse	We may want to ask the professor about this... I worry our games are too different. 
2018-03-17 00:11:58	ajshryoc	You can delete cardsTest.py if no one is using it. I would probably make a new directory in the git repo called 'project3' or something so that we have a record of both of our submissions. As for the issues with the games, if you want to ask him, go ahead. I think we could make it work but I'm sure he could provide some insight. <--- Sorry typed this up about 14 hours ago and never hit send 
2018-03-19 14:19:24	Jesse	We got a 90% it seems on what we submitted for the project. He said he liked our nouns/verbs but was disappointed that we didn't make an FSM. He also linked "Derive Interfaces from Constraints of Data" as if its some reading on moodle or github. 
2018-03-19 14:19:57	Jesse	... I checked both, and I'm not sure what he's talking about 
2018-03-19 14:36:38	ajshryoc	I'm also unsure what he meant by that. Our design did get a shoutout in #proj2_mar1 though so that's pretty cool 
2018-03-19 14:38:04	Jesse	i didn't see that. that is pretty cool 
2018-03-19 14:38:44	ajshryoc	Also, just realized the section the he references is also in that Google doc with the feedback 
2018-03-19 15:03:59	jwstanl3	Even after looking at that section, I'm still not sure what he wants us to get from that. The lines he references are where the suits are printed in Crazy Eights to allow the user to select which suit to change to. I don't get how that could be changed. 
2018-03-19 16:30:23	ajshryoc	It could definitely be made better. I think the whole system, crazy eights especially, could benefit from state machines. I intended to cleanup some of that code, but I decided to just wait until this upcoming submission. I'll take a better look at the comments later 
2018-03-19 17:59:01	Jesse	I'm not sure I know how the system could be improved with FSMs. But if you know what you'd like to change, I could definitely help out with that. The issue I see with FSMs is that only crazy eights would use it... and it would just be wasted code for solitaire. 
2018-03-19 19:10:58	ajshryoc	I'm sure he'll provide more context tomorrow. I'll review their comments too and we can go from there 
2018-03-20 10:11:37	Jesse	Hey guys, I was checking out a few other peoples code, and i found one where they built the FSM setup stuff, and didn't call it anywhere in their code xD. I wonder if the graders caught it.

2018-03-28 20:46:28	Jesse	I get what you mean, and I tried coding that up last night, but I'm struggling with what should be classes vs methods vs variables, and how should all of these things be linked up together?   
2018-03-28 20:49:16	Jesse	I guess the obvious answer would be to have all states and transitions be their own classes... but it also doesn't make sense for them to be their own classes when they might only have one variable or one method... and if the method just says pass, it doesn't really make sense to even have that method... 
2018-03-28 20:50:07	Jesse	And so you take the approach of having strings be states and methods being transitions... which is exactly how our code is now.. 
2018-03-28 20:50:32	Jesse	That's where my confusion with this project is. 
2018-03-28 20:52:56	ajshryoc	Yes, you're right and I'm not 100% sure how this implementation would work either. But, a lot of that I think could be solved by how it's implemented. For example, the State class could have a default implementation of each of its methods that is just "pass", that way, if you don't need the method, you don't worry about it. 
2018-03-28 20:55:40	ajshryoc	I think that Start, Play, Goal, and Fail could each be subclasses of State. When, as an example, Crazy Eights goes to instantiate a Start state, it should just have to pass in a lambda body that sets up the game. So, it wouldn't even need to subclass a new Start state (although it could). I think that it would look something like this: 
2018-03-28 20:55:45	ajshryoc	`start = new StartState(onEntry=setupCrazyEights)` 
2018-03-28 20:56:46	ajshryoc	`game.fsm = new FSM(start=start, play=runGame, end=endGame)` 
2018-03-28 20:57:07	ajshryoc	Or something like that. I may be oversimplifying things but I think it's doable 
2018-03-28 21:01:18	Jesse	I'll give it another shot tonight and let you know how it ends up tomorrow 
2018-03-28 21:02:43	ajshryoc	Okay, I will take a look at it too 
2018-03-28 21:24:44	Jesse	@Jesse uploaded a file: https://plm18.slack.com/files/U8N7VJU30/F9Z06TD0X/fsm.py (fsm) 
2018-03-28 21:24:51	Jesse	does that look like a good start? 
2018-03-28 21:32:03	Jesse	I really like the idea of passing in lambda bodies to abstract functions... that solved some of my 'why' questions earlier.. but its still kinda confusin  
2018-03-28 21:32:17	ajshryoc	Yeah, I think so. For the lambdas you pass in, you should just be able to pass in a function that performs the 'move' operation  (edited)
2018-03-28 21:32:36	ajshryoc	But, yeah I agree it is a little confusing 
2018-03-28 21:59:24	Jesse	nevermind, this whole thing seems stupid again... its like we're just making 4 methods for the sake of calling the same methods we would have initially. We pass the functions into some abstract class which just calls those methods in the abstract class... why not just call the functions? 
2018-03-28 22:04:45	Jesse	This whole process isn't saving us any lines of code... and as far as run-time and memory goes, this is more inefficient than what we've coded. It's even more unreadable too since theres more files for future programmers to go through. 
2018-03-28 23:14:21	ajshryoc	I'm working through a test version of crazy eights using an FSM, so hopefully that will help clear things up (if it works) 
2018-04-02 16:59:46	Jesse	Would either of you be free tonight to work on the plm stuff? or at least be free to instruct me on how I can help with the plm stuff? (since I haven't been very helpful so far) 
2018-04-02 17:32:35	ajshryoc	I am not free tonight to meet, but I should be able to push a working version of Crazy Eights with the FSM. Hopefully that will clear things up on how to implement the games with an FSM. Do you have ideas on things to change other than re-implementing the games with an FSM? 
2018-04-02 17:53:32	Jesse	not really, but we also have a paper we have to write. If I cannot find any improvements to the code, I'll try to get started on that.

2018-04-02 18:49:50	ajshryoc	I committed what I have so far to the other branch. You're welcome to take a look at it and continue developing it if that interests you. My approach so far has been to shove as much of what we already had as possible into the FSM. When I get back later, I will probably start rebuilding some of the functions passed into the FSM from the ground up to get rid of any issues I am just completely overlooking from our first iteration  (edited)
2018-04-02 19:10:11	Jesse	I think I'm going to get all of the non-fsm stuff into the CrazyEights.py file so it can be a lil more organized.

2018-04-02 20:17:07	ajshryoc	I like that idea. I was originally going to just have two versions of Crazy Eights until I got the FSM one working and then copy that over into CrazyEights.py, but I like your separation of logic here. I think at the very least we could label the FSM specification as the "domain specific language" he's looking for especially now that it's separated. 
2018-04-02 20:17:52	ajshryoc	Like I said before, I'm going to try re-writing the game logic to make it better-suited to the FSM to hopefully get rid of the bugs 
2018-04-02 20:18:24	Jesse	ok. im makin some changes now so don't do anything big :P 
2018-04-02 20:19:16	ajshryoc	Okay, no problem. Anything specific you are looking at or I should avoid? 
2018-04-02 20:20:56	Jesse	im trying to have everything output to a log file. it's just annoying because of how python handles inheritance 
2018-04-02 20:29:47	Jesse	the stupidly annoying thing about the log file is that every object needs one, and I can't open the same file multiple times without problems I don't think. 
2018-04-02 20:35:00	Jesse	i just undid my changes. You're free to edit it 
2018-04-02 20:35:22	ajshryoc	I'm unfamiliar with logs in python. Is there a specific package for it that giving you trouble or just using file i/o? 
2018-04-02 20:35:46	Jesse	I tried both  
2018-04-02 20:37:07	Jesse	either way, it would make us have a ton of duplicated code if we tried to put it in there.  
2018-04-02 20:54:54	Jesse	im gonna try to implement the solitaire stuff like you have with the fsms 
2018-04-02 20:56:14	ajshryoc	Okay, how do you want to get the FSM code? I could merge to master or you could branch off of crazy-eights-fsm 
2018-04-02 20:57:07	Jesse	ill just branch off crazy-eights-fsm 
2018-04-02 21:59:48	Jesse	it doesn't look like the guards are being called. 
2018-04-02 21:59:50	Jesse	are they? 
2018-04-02 22:50:13	Jesse	theres some bugs in the solitaire fsm but its pretty much there. 
2018-04-02 23:14:14	Jesse	let me know if you guys are wanting to do the "bonus projects" that menzies just listed a couple hours ago. 
2018-04-02 23:51:15	ajshryoc	Yeah, they're being called for me. I accidentally was calling them in the state object declaration for awhile though because I had the syntax wrong 
2018-04-02 23:51:27	ajshryoc	I'll look more into the bonus projects tomorrow

2018-04-05 19:11:31	Jesse	if I run the game from the __main__ method then it doesn't give me that error. 
2018-04-05 19:13:21	Jesse	but it has an issue with the logger I made. 
2018-04-05 19:16:27	Jesse	got it workin 
2018-04-05 19:21:18	ajshryoc	Okay, good. Sorry about the issues 
2018-04-05 19:21:45	Jesse	it's fine. The logger is working to one file. [:+1:1]

2018-04-06 15:23:12	Jesse	hey guys, what other changes were you guys wanting to add to the project. I might be able to get something done now, but I'd need to know what. 
2018-04-06 15:31:34	ajshryoc	Crazy eights could use some more refactoring if you're up for that. I think pulling out the UI components to another module would clean things up. I also think we should consider ways to get rid of the payload params for transitions and states. Maybe define a generic environment  (Game) that that state machine passes around and the guards/state functions all know about. Not sure how hard that would be to implement 
2018-04-06 16:08:02	Jesse	Sorry I'm getting distracted playing with my raspberry pi. I'll try to work on that a lil later today. 
2018-04-06 16:28:15	ajshryoc	No problem. Was just a suggestion for where to go from here 
2018-04-07 10:17:49	Jesse	passing around the game environment would be a little bit of a pain, but I think it's doable. I'll see if I can refactor crazy eights a bit more before I try to do the environment thing. 
2018-04-07 10:26:08	Jesse	why does crazy eights have a makeMove FSM? 
2018-04-07 10:26:15	Jesse	it seems redundant 
2018-04-07 10:31:20	Jesse	also it looks like someone was trying to undo my Logger.log methods and just put the string in input(). we cannot do this because then that input string will not be in our log.txt

2018-04-07 16:57:26	Jesse	I tried converting a lot of the Transition statements and State creation methods into a for loop, but to be honest, it didn't save me many lines of code, and had bugs that I couldn't figure out why it was happening. 
2018-04-07 16:58:54	Jesse	It seemed like it would've been a good idea since it's repetitive code, but it made it much harder to read. 
2018-04-07 17:00:51	Jesse	I've looked a lil into passing around a game object, but we would need to have a bunch of variables keeping track of who the current player is and who the next player is... the whole process seemed like it would defeat the purpose of the FSM andrew made.  
2018-04-10 12:05:22	Jesse	Hey Joseph, have you pushed the changes you were talking to me about on the bus? 
2018-04-10 12:07:47	Jesse	Also, I'll be available up until and after class to work on this if anyone wants to join me.

2018-04-10 12:32:44	jwstanl3	I pushed my work so far. I'm still working through the cards file to see what I can make concrete between the two games and what needs to be abstracted to subclasses. 
2018-04-10 12:34:29	Jesse	Thanks, I'm trying to make unit tests. 
2018-04-10 12:34:41	Jesse	although the import statements are a huge pain. 
2018-04-10 12:36:54	Jesse	I hate that python cares about what directory you're in whenever you start the program. 
2018-04-10 13:16:15	Jesse	I found a way to make all of our imports absolute rather than relative. We just have to make a virtual environment and give the users instructions to set it up.

2018-02-24 12:28:32	Jesse	Do you guys understand python decorators? I haven't been able to reproduce a function that demonstrates the difference with/without the decorator. 
2018-02-25 20:28:31	ajshryoc	Sorry, intended to respond, then totally forgot about this. My understanding of python decorators is it's just another form of syntax for calling functions; however, it sort of ties two functions together and modifies the function being decorated. Here's an article I found that gives a good explanation on the subject: http://python-3-patterns-idioms-test.readthedocs.io/en/latest/PythonDecorators.html

2018-02-25 22:39:22	ajshryoc	Just pushed the finished version of Crazy Eights. It's kinda a mess, so I'll probably do some refactoring of it at some point. I also modified cards.py to print out the unicode symbol corresponding to the card's suit. I was curious about how to do it and it turned out to be really easy, so I added it. I think it makes it much easier to see the cards 
2018-02-25 22:41:04	Jesse	oh nice!!! let me know if theres anything youd like me to change.  
2018-02-26 13:50:38	Jesse	I played both crazy eights and solitaire and I haven't noticed any bugs. winning looks good as well. 
2018-02-26 13:52:31	Jesse	we may be able to polish a few things up but honestly, it doesn't matter too much because we'll be taking parts of our code out and re implementing stuff for the second submission. I think what we have is gold. If there's anything you guys want me to change, just let me know. 
2018-02-26 17:12:29	ajshryoc	Glad you liked it! I think they both play pretty well

2018-03-12 13:11:03	Jesse	Do you guys have the transcript of the 2 games? if not I can make them. 
2018-03-12 13:12:50	ajshryoc	I don't have a transcript. You should be able to use the tee command to output to a file and stdout 
2018-03-12 13:13:04	Jesse	I was just gonna use script 
2018-03-12 13:13:18	Jesse	it automatically outputs the log to a file

2018-03-16 10:06:54	Jesse	I'm gonna take a look now about what we can do to our project for submission 3. 
2018-03-16 10:13:12	Jesse	Nobody but me used cardsTest.py right? would you guys mind if I deleted that file? 
2018-03-16 10:17:46	Jesse	We may want to ask the professor about this... I worry our games are too different. 
2018-03-17 00:11:58	ajshryoc	You can delete cardsTest.py if no one is using it. I would probably make a new directory in the git repo called 'project3' or something so that we have a record of both of our submissions. As for the issues with the games, if you want to ask him, go ahead. I think we could make it work but I'm sure he could provide some insight. <--- Sorry typed this up about 14 hours ago and never hit send 
2018-03-19 14:19:24	Jesse	We got a 90% it seems on what we submitted for the project. He said he liked our nouns/verbs but was disappointed that we didn't make an FSM. He also linked "Derive Interfaces from Constraints of Data" as if its some reading on moodle or github. 
2018-03-19 14:19:57	Jesse	... I checked both, and I'm not sure what he's talking about 
2018-03-19 14:36:38	ajshryoc	I'm also unsure what he meant by that. Our design did get a shoutout in #proj2_mar1 though so that's pretty cool 
2018-03-19 14:38:04	Jesse	i didn't see that. that is pretty cool 
2018-03-19 14:38:44	ajshryoc	Also, just realized the section the he references is also in that Google doc with the feedback 
2018-03-19 15:03:59	jwstanl3	Even after looking at that section, I'm still not sure what he wants us to get from that. The lines he references are where the suits are printed in Crazy Eights to allow the user to select which suit to change to. I don't get how that could be changed. 
2018-03-19 16:30:23	ajshryoc	It could definitely be made better. I think the whole system, crazy eights especially, could benefit from state machines. I intended to cleanup some of that code, but I decided to just wait until this upcoming submission. I'll take a better look at the comments later 
2018-03-19 17:59:01	Jesse	I'm not sure I know how the system could be improved with FSMs. But if you know what you'd like to change, I could definitely help out with that. The issue I see with FSMs is that only crazy eights would use it... and it would just be wasted code for solitaire. 
2018-03-19 19:10:58	ajshryoc	I'm sure he'll provide more context tomorrow. I'll review their comments too and we can go from there 
2018-03-20 10:11:37	Jesse	Hey guys, I was checking out a few other peoples code, and i found one where they built the FSM setup stuff, and didn't call it anywhere in their code xD. I wonder if the graders caught it.

2018-03-28 20:46:28	Jesse	I get what you mean, and I tried coding that up last night, but I'm struggling with what should be classes vs methods vs variables, and how should all of these things be linked up together?   
2018-03-28 20:49:16	Jesse	I guess the obvious answer would be to have all states and transitions be their own classes... but it also doesn't make sense for them to be their own classes when they might only have one variable or one method... and if the method just says pass, it doesn't really make sense to even have that method... 
2018-03-28 20:50:07	Jesse	And so you take the approach of having strings be states and methods being transitions... which is exactly how our code is now.. 
2018-03-28 20:50:32	Jesse	That's where my confusion with this project is. 
2018-03-28 20:52:56	ajshryoc	Yes, you're right and I'm not 100% sure how this implementation would work either. But, a lot of that I think could be solved by how it's implemented. For example, the State class could have a default implementation of each of its methods that is just "pass", that way, if you don't need the method, you don't worry about it. 
2018-03-28 20:55:40	ajshryoc	I think that Start, Play, Goal, and Fail could each be subclasses of State. When, as an example, Crazy Eights goes to instantiate a Start state, it should just have to pass in a lambda body that sets up the game. So, it wouldn't even need to subclass a new Start state (although it could). I think that it would look something like this: 
2018-03-28 20:55:45	ajshryoc	`start = new StartState(onEntry=setupCrazyEights)` 
2018-03-28 20:56:46	ajshryoc	`game.fsm = new FSM(start=start, play=runGame, end=endGame)` 
2018-03-28 20:57:07	ajshryoc	Or something like that. I may be oversimplifying things but I think it's doable 
2018-03-28 21:01:18	Jesse	I'll give it another shot tonight and let you know how it ends up tomorrow 
2018-03-28 21:02:43	ajshryoc	Okay, I will take a look at it too 
2018-03-28 21:24:44	Jesse	@Jesse uploaded a file: https://plm18.slack.com/files/U8N7VJU30/F9Z06TD0X/fsm.py (fsm) 
2018-03-28 21:24:51	Jesse	does that look like a good start? 
2018-03-28 21:32:03	Jesse	I really like the idea of passing in lambda bodies to abstract functions... that solved some of my 'why' questions earlier.. but its still kinda confusin  
2018-03-28 21:32:17	ajshryoc	Yeah, I think so. For the lambdas you pass in, you should just be able to pass in a function that performs the 'move' operation  (edited)
2018-03-28 21:32:36	ajshryoc	But, yeah I agree it is a little confusing 
2018-03-28 21:59:24	Jesse	nevermind, this whole thing seems stupid again... its like we're just making 4 methods for the sake of calling the same methods we would have initially. We pass the functions into some abstract class which just calls those methods in the abstract class... why not just call the functions? 
2018-03-28 22:04:45	Jesse	This whole process isn't saving us any lines of code... and as far as run-time and memory goes, this is more inefficient than what we've coded. It's even more unreadable too since theres more files for future programmers to go through. 
2018-03-28 23:14:21	ajshryoc	I'm working through a test version of crazy eights using an FSM, so hopefully that will help clear things up (if it works) 
2018-04-02 16:59:46	Jesse	Would either of you be free tonight to work on the plm stuff? or at least be free to instruct me on how I can help with the plm stuff? (since I haven't been very helpful so far) 
2018-04-02 17:32:35	ajshryoc	I am not free tonight to meet, but I should be able to push a working version of Crazy Eights with the FSM. Hopefully that will clear things up on how to implement the games with an FSM. Do you have ideas on things to change other than re-implementing the games with an FSM? 
2018-04-02 17:53:32	Jesse	not really, but we also have a paper we have to write. If I cannot find any improvements to the code, I'll try to get started on that.

2018-04-02 18:49:50	ajshryoc	I committed what I have so far to the other branch. You're welcome to take a look at it and continue developing it if that interests you. My approach so far has been to shove as much of what we already had as possible into the FSM. When I get back later, I will probably start rebuilding some of the functions passed into the FSM from the ground up to get rid of any issues I am just completely overlooking from our first iteration  (edited)
2018-04-02 19:10:11	Jesse	I think I'm going to get all of the non-fsm stuff into the CrazyEights.py file so it can be a lil more organized.

2018-04-02 20:17:07	ajshryoc	I like that idea. I was originally going to just have two versions of Crazy Eights until I got the FSM one working and then copy that over into CrazyEights.py, but I like your separation of logic here. I think at the very least we could label the FSM specification as the "domain specific language" he's looking for especially now that it's separated. 
2018-04-02 20:17:52	ajshryoc	Like I said before, I'm going to try re-writing the game logic to make it better-suited to the FSM to hopefully get rid of the bugs 
2018-04-02 20:18:24	Jesse	ok. im makin some changes now so don't do anything big :P 
2018-04-02 20:19:16	ajshryoc	Okay, no problem. Anything specific you are looking at or I should avoid? 
2018-04-02 20:20:56	Jesse	im trying to have everything output to a log file. it's just annoying because of how python handles inheritance 
2018-04-02 20:29:47	Jesse	the stupidly annoying thing about the log file is that every object needs one, and I can't open the same file multiple times without problems I don't think. 
2018-04-02 20:35:00	Jesse	i just undid my changes. You're free to edit it 
2018-04-02 20:35:22	ajshryoc	I'm unfamiliar with logs in python. Is there a specific package for it that giving you trouble or just using file i/o? 
2018-04-02 20:35:46	Jesse	I tried both  
2018-04-02 20:37:07	Jesse	either way, it would make us have a ton of duplicated code if we tried to put it in there.  
2018-04-02 20:54:54	Jesse	im gonna try to implement the solitaire stuff like you have with the fsms 
2018-04-02 20:56:14	ajshryoc	Okay, how do you want to get the FSM code? I could merge to master or you could branch off of crazy-eights-fsm 
2018-04-02 20:57:07	Jesse	ill just branch off crazy-eights-fsm 
2018-04-02 21:59:48	Jesse	it doesn't look like the guards are being called. 
2018-04-02 21:59:50	Jesse	are they? 
2018-04-02 22:50:13	Jesse	theres some bugs in the solitaire fsm but its pretty much there. 
2018-04-02 23:14:14	Jesse	let me know if you guys are wanting to do the "bonus projects" that menzies just listed a couple hours ago. 
2018-04-02 23:51:15	ajshryoc	Yeah, they're being called for me. I accidentally was calling them in the state object declaration for awhile though because I had the syntax wrong 
2018-04-02 23:51:27	ajshryoc	I'll look more into the bonus projects tomorrow

2018-04-05 19:00:29	Jesse	:( 
2018-04-05 19:00:40	ajshryoc	Are you running python3 or just python? I know Joseph had an issue with that 
2018-04-05 19:00:53	Jesse	3 
2018-04-05 19:01:15	ajshryoc	What's the error it gives you? 
2018-04-05 19:08:39	Jesse	no module found 
2018-04-05 19:11:31	Jesse	if I run the game from the __main__ method then it doesn't give me that error. 
2018-04-05 19:13:21	Jesse	but it has an issue with the logger I made. 
2018-04-05 19:16:27	Jesse	got it workin 
2018-04-05 19:21:18	ajshryoc	Okay, good. Sorry about the issues 
2018-04-05 19:21:45	Jesse	it's fine. The logger is working to one file. [:+1:1]

2018-04-06 15:23:12	Jesse	hey guys, what other changes were you guys wanting to add to the project. I might be able to get something done now, but I'd need to know what. 
2018-04-06 15:31:34	ajshryoc	Crazy eights could use some more refactoring if you're up for that. I think pulling out the UI components to another module would clean things up. I also think we should consider ways to get rid of the payload params for transitions and states. Maybe define a generic environment  (Game) that that state machine passes around and the guards/state functions all know about. Not sure how hard that would be to implement 
2018-04-06 16:08:02	Jesse	Sorry I'm getting distracted playing with my raspberry pi. I'll try to work on that a lil later today. 
2018-04-06 16:28:15	ajshryoc	No problem. Was just a suggestion for where to go from here 
2018-04-07 10:17:49	Jesse	passing around the game environment would be a little bit of a pain, but I think it's doable. I'll see if I can refactor crazy eights a bit more before I try to do the environment thing. 
2018-04-07 10:26:08	Jesse	why does crazy eights have a makeMove FSM? 
2018-04-07 10:26:15	Jesse	it seems redundant 
2018-04-07 10:31:20	Jesse	also it looks like someone was trying to undo my Logger.log methods and just put the string in input(). we cannot do this because then that input string will not be in our log.txt

2018-04-07 16:57:26	Jesse	I tried converting a lot of the Transition statements and State creation methods into a for loop, but to be honest, it didn't save me many lines of code, and had bugs that I couldn't figure out why it was happening. 
2018-04-07 16:58:54	Jesse	It seemed like it would've been a good idea since it's repetitive code, but it made it much harder to read. 
2018-04-07 17:00:51	Jesse	I've looked a lil into passing around a game object, but we would need to have a bunch of variables keeping track of who the current player is and who the next player is... the whole process seemed like it would defeat the purpose of the FSM andrew made.  
2018-04-10 12:05:22	Jesse	Hey Joseph, have you pushed the changes you were talking to me about on the bus? 
2018-04-10 12:07:47	Jesse	Also, I'll be available up until and after class to work on this if anyone wants to join me.

2018-04-10 12:32:44	jwstanl3	I pushed my work so far. I'm still working through the cards file to see what I can make concrete between the two games and what needs to be abstracted to subclasses. 
2018-04-10 12:34:29	Jesse	Thanks, I'm trying to make unit tests. 
2018-04-10 12:34:41	Jesse	although the import statements are a huge pain. 
2018-04-10 12:36:54	Jesse	I hate that python cares about what directory you're in whenever you start the program. 
2018-04-10 13:16:15	Jesse	I found a way to make all of our imports absolute rather than relative. We just have to make a virtual environment and give the users instructions to set it up.

2018-02-26 13:50:38	Jesse	I played both crazy eights and solitaire and I haven't noticed any bugs. winning looks good as well. 
2018-02-26 13:52:31	Jesse	we may be able to polish a few things up but honestly, it doesn't matter too much because we'll be taking parts of our code out and re implementing stuff for the second submission. I think what we have is gold. If there's anything you guys want me to change, just let me know. 
2018-02-26 17:12:29	ajshryoc	Glad you liked it! I think they both play pretty well 
2018-03-12 13:07:36	Jesse	Hey guys, we need to figure out what we need to submit and submit it before class tomorrow. 
2018-03-12 13:11:03	Jesse	Do you guys have the transcript of the 2 games? if not I can make them. 
2018-03-12 13:12:50	ajshryoc	I don't have a transcript. You should be able to use the tee command to output to a file and stdout 
2018-03-12 13:13:04	Jesse	I was just gonna use script 
2018-03-12 13:13:18	Jesse	it automatically outputs the log to a file

2018-03-16 10:06:54	Jesse	I'm gonna take a look now about what we can do to our project for submission 3. 
2018-03-16 10:13:12	Jesse	Nobody but me used cardsTest.py right? would you guys mind if I deleted that file? 
2018-03-16 10:17:46	Jesse	We may want to ask the professor about this... I worry our games are too different. 
2018-03-17 00:11:58	ajshryoc	You can delete cardsTest.py if no one is using it. I would probably make a new directory in the git repo called 'project3' or something so that we have a record of both of our submissions. As for the issues with the games, if you want to ask him, go ahead. I think we could make it work but I'm sure he could provide some insight. <--- Sorry typed this up about 14 hours ago and never hit send 
2018-03-19 14:19:24	Jesse	We got a 90% it seems on what we submitted for the project. He said he liked our nouns/verbs but was disappointed that we didn't make an FSM. He also linked "Derive Interfaces from Constraints of Data" as if its some reading on moodle or github. 
2018-03-19 14:19:57	Jesse	... I checked both, and I'm not sure what he's talking about 
2018-03-19 14:36:38	ajshryoc	I'm also unsure what he meant by that. Our design did get a shoutout in #proj2_mar1 though so that's pretty cool 
2018-03-19 14:38:04	Jesse	i didn't see that. that is pretty cool 
2018-03-19 14:38:44	ajshryoc	Also, just realized the section the he references is also in that Google doc with the feedback 
2018-03-19 15:03:59	jwstanl3	Even after looking at that section, I'm still not sure what he wants us to get from that. The lines he references are where the suits are printed in Crazy Eights to allow the user to select which suit to change to. I don't get how that could be changed. 
2018-03-19 16:30:23	ajshryoc	It could definitely be made better. I think the whole system, crazy eights especially, could benefit from state machines. I intended to cleanup some of that code, but I decided to just wait until this upcoming submission. I'll take a better look at the comments later 
2018-03-19 17:59:01	Jesse	I'm not sure I know how the system could be improved with FSMs. But if you know what you'd like to change, I could definitely help out with that. The issue I see with FSMs is that only crazy eights would use it... and it would just be wasted code for solitaire. 
2018-03-19 19:10:58	ajshryoc	I'm sure he'll provide more context tomorrow. I'll review their comments too and we can go from there 
2018-03-20 10:11:37	Jesse	Hey guys, I was checking out a few other peoples code, and i found one where they built the FSM setup stuff, and didn't call it anywhere in their code xD. I wonder if the graders caught it.

2018-03-28 20:46:28	Jesse	I get what you mean, and I tried coding that up last night, but I'm struggling with what should be classes vs methods vs variables, and how should all of these things be linked up together?   
2018-03-28 20:49:16	Jesse	I guess the obvious answer would be to have all states and transitions be their own classes... but it also doesn't make sense for them to be their own classes when they might only have one variable or one method... and if the method just says pass, it doesn't really make sense to even have that method... 
2018-03-28 20:50:07	Jesse	And so you take the approach of having strings be states and methods being transitions... which is exactly how our code is now.. 
2018-03-28 20:50:32	Jesse	That's where my confusion with this project is. 
2018-03-28 20:52:56	ajshryoc	Yes, you're right and I'm not 100% sure how this implementation would work either. But, a lot of that I think could be solved by how it's implemented. For example, the State class could have a default implementation of each of its methods that is just "pass", that way, if you don't need the method, you don't worry about it. 
2018-03-28 20:55:40	ajshryoc	I think that Start, Play, Goal, and Fail could each be subclasses of State. When, as an example, Crazy Eights goes to instantiate a Start state, it should just have to pass in a lambda body that sets up the game. So, it wouldn't even need to subclass a new Start state (although it could). I think that it would look something like this: 
2018-03-28 20:55:45	ajshryoc	`start = new StartState(onEntry=setupCrazyEights)` 
2018-03-28 20:56:46	ajshryoc	`game.fsm = new FSM(start=start, play=runGame, end=endGame)` 
2018-03-28 20:57:07	ajshryoc	Or something like that. I may be oversimplifying things but I think it's doable 
2018-03-28 21:01:18	Jesse	I'll give it another shot tonight and let you know how it ends up tomorrow 
2018-03-28 21:02:43	ajshryoc	Okay, I will take a look at it too 
2018-03-28 21:24:44	Jesse	@Jesse uploaded a file: https://plm18.slack.com/files/U8N7VJU30/F9Z06TD0X/fsm.py (fsm) 
2018-03-28 21:24:51	Jesse	does that look like a good start? 
2018-03-28 21:32:03	Jesse	I really like the idea of passing in lambda bodies to abstract functions... that solved some of my 'why' questions earlier.. but its still kinda confusin  
2018-03-28 21:32:17	ajshryoc	Yeah, I think so. For the lambdas you pass in, you should just be able to pass in a function that performs the 'move' operation  (edited)
2018-03-28 21:32:36	ajshryoc	But, yeah I agree it is a little confusing 
2018-03-28 21:59:24	Jesse	nevermind, this whole thing seems stupid again... its like we're just making 4 methods for the sake of calling the same methods we would have initially. We pass the functions into some abstract class which just calls those methods in the abstract class... why not just call the functions? 
2018-03-28 22:04:45	Jesse	This whole process isn't saving us any lines of code... and as far as run-time and memory goes, this is more inefficient than what we've coded. It's even more unreadable too since theres more files for future programmers to go through. 
2018-03-28 23:14:21	ajshryoc	I'm working through a test version of crazy eights using an FSM, so hopefully that will help clear things up (if it works) 
2018-04-02 16:59:46	Jesse	Would either of you be free tonight to work on the plm stuff? or at least be free to instruct me on how I can help with the plm stuff? (since I haven't been very helpful so far) 
2018-04-02 17:32:35	ajshryoc	I am not free tonight to meet, but I should be able to push a working version of Crazy Eights with the FSM. Hopefully that will clear things up on how to implement the games with an FSM. Do you have ideas on things to change other than re-implementing the games with an FSM? 
2018-04-02 17:53:32	Jesse	not really, but we also have a paper we have to write. If I cannot find any improvements to the code, I'll try to get started on that.

2018-04-02 18:49:50	ajshryoc	I committed what I have so far to the other branch. You're welcome to take a look at it and continue developing it if that interests you. My approach so far has been to shove as much of what we already had as possible into the FSM. When I get back later, I will probably start rebuilding some of the functions passed into the FSM from the ground up to get rid of any issues I am just completely overlooking from our first iteration  (edited)
2018-04-02 19:10:11	Jesse	I think I'm going to get all of the non-fsm stuff into the CrazyEights.py file so it can be a lil more organized.

2018-04-02 20:17:07	ajshryoc	I like that idea. I was originally going to just have two versions of Crazy Eights until I got the FSM one working and then copy that over into CrazyEights.py, but I like your separation of logic here. I think at the very least we could label the FSM specification as the "domain specific language" he's looking for especially now that it's separated. 
2018-04-02 20:17:52	ajshryoc	Like I said before, I'm going to try re-writing the game logic to make it better-suited to the FSM to hopefully get rid of the bugs 
2018-04-02 20:18:24	Jesse	ok. im makin some changes now so don't do anything big :P 
2018-04-02 20:19:16	ajshryoc	Okay, no problem. Anything specific you are looking at or I should avoid? 
2018-04-02 20:20:56	Jesse	im trying to have everything output to a log file. it's just annoying because of how python handles inheritance 
2018-04-02 20:29:47	Jesse	the stupidly annoying thing about the log file is that every object needs one, and I can't open the same file multiple times without problems I don't think. 
2018-04-02 20:35:00	Jesse	i just undid my changes. You're free to edit it 
2018-04-02 20:35:22	ajshryoc	I'm unfamiliar with logs in python. Is there a specific package for it that giving you trouble or just using file i/o? 
2018-04-02 20:35:46	Jesse	I tried both  
2018-04-02 20:37:07	Jesse	either way, it would make us have a ton of duplicated code if we tried to put it in there.  
2018-04-02 20:54:54	Jesse	im gonna try to implement the solitaire stuff like you have with the fsms 
2018-04-02 20:56:14	ajshryoc	Okay, how do you want to get the FSM code? I could merge to master or you could branch off of crazy-eights-fsm 
2018-04-02 20:57:07	Jesse	ill just branch off crazy-eights-fsm 
2018-04-02 21:59:48	Jesse	it doesn't look like the guards are being called. 
2018-04-02 21:59:50	Jesse	are they? 
2018-04-02 22:50:13	Jesse	theres some bugs in the solitaire fsm but its pretty much there. 
2018-04-02 23:14:14	Jesse	let me know if you guys are wanting to do the "bonus projects" that menzies just listed a couple hours ago. 
2018-04-02 23:51:15	ajshryoc	Yeah, they're being called for me. I accidentally was calling them in the state object declaration for awhile though because I had the syntax wrong 
2018-04-02 23:51:27	ajshryoc	I'll look more into the bonus projects tomorrow

2018-04-05 19:01:15	ajshryoc	What's the error it gives you? 
2018-04-05 19:08:39	Jesse	no module found 
2018-04-05 19:11:31	Jesse	if I run the game from the __main__ method then it doesn't give me that error. 
2018-04-05 19:13:21	Jesse	but it has an issue with the logger I made. 
2018-04-05 19:16:27	Jesse	got it workin 
2018-04-05 19:21:18	ajshryoc	Okay, good. Sorry about the issues 
2018-04-05 19:21:45	Jesse	it's fine. The logger is working to one file. [:+1:1]

2018-04-06 15:23:12	Jesse	hey guys, what other changes were you guys wanting to add to the project. I might be able to get something done now, but I'd need to know what. 
2018-04-06 15:31:34	ajshryoc	Crazy eights could use some more refactoring if you're up for that. I think pulling out the UI components to another module would clean things up. I also think we should consider ways to get rid of the payload params for transitions and states. Maybe define a generic environment  (Game) that that state machine passes around and the guards/state functions all know about. Not sure how hard that would be to implement 
2018-04-06 16:08:02	Jesse	Sorry I'm getting distracted playing with my raspberry pi. I'll try to work on that a lil later today. 
2018-04-06 16:28:15	ajshryoc	No problem. Was just a suggestion for where to go from here 
2018-04-07 10:17:49	Jesse	passing around the game environment would be a little bit of a pain, but I think it's doable. I'll see if I can refactor crazy eights a bit more before I try to do the environment thing. 
2018-04-07 10:26:08	Jesse	why does crazy eights have a makeMove FSM? 
2018-04-07 10:26:15	Jesse	it seems redundant 
2018-04-07 10:31:20	Jesse	also it looks like someone was trying to undo my Logger.log methods and just put the string in input(). we cannot do this because then that input string will not be in our log.txt

2018-04-07 16:57:26	Jesse	I tried converting a lot of the Transition statements and State creation methods into a for loop, but to be honest, it didn't save me many lines of code, and had bugs that I couldn't figure out why it was happening. 
2018-04-07 16:58:54	Jesse	It seemed like it would've been a good idea since it's repetitive code, but it made it much harder to read. 
2018-04-07 17:00:51	Jesse	I've looked a lil into passing around a game object, but we would need to have a bunch of variables keeping track of who the current player is and who the next player is... the whole process seemed like it would defeat the purpose of the FSM andrew made.  
2018-04-10 12:05:22	Jesse	Hey Joseph, have you pushed the changes you were talking to me about on the bus? 
2018-04-10 12:07:47	Jesse	Also, I'll be available up until and after class to work on this if anyone wants to join me.

2018-04-10 12:32:44	jwstanl3	I pushed my work so far. I'm still working through the cards file to see what I can make concrete between the two games and what needs to be abstracted to subclasses. 
2018-04-10 12:34:29	Jesse	Thanks, I'm trying to make unit tests. 
2018-04-10 12:34:41	Jesse	although the import statements are a huge pain. 
2018-04-10 12:36:54	Jesse	I hate that python cares about what directory you're in whenever you start the program. 
2018-04-10 13:16:15	Jesse	I found a way to make all of our imports absolute rather than relative. We just have to make a virtual environment and give the users instructions to set it up.

2018-04-14 20:08:30	jwstanl3	I just pushed everything I've done so far. All of the FSM and game classes (e.g., machine, state, card, pile, deck) seem to be finished; I just want to test them a little more. I've implemented Solitaire with these classes and it seems to run fine. You can run it with test.py in the src folder. I'll move this into the main file later. I also need to move the Crazy Eights code into a new game class and then clean everything up. 
2018-04-14 20:24:44	ajshryoc	Cool. Just wanted to make sure we got your stuff in there before continuing to work on other parts of the project. Outside of the stuff you're working on, is there anything else you think we need to do before the submission? 
2018-04-14 23:22:57	Jesse	dont forget about the two logs per game. sorry ive been ignoring the past few messages, Ive been finishing up ENG 331. I should be coming back to raleigh some time tomorrow so let me know if you guys want to meet or anything. 
2018-04-16 08:09:05	Jesse	The project is due today. Let me know if you guys want me to do anything to help. We also need to remember to have a top-level directory called proj3 and have the 2 text transcripts of the games.. (which we could probably get away with using the ones we made last time.) 
2018-04-16 16:33:23		getting channel history...
2018-03-12 13:12:50	ajshryoc	I don't have a transcript. You should be able to use the tee command to output to a file and stdout 
2018-03-12 13:13:04	Jesse	I was just gonna use script 
2018-03-12 13:13:18	Jesse	it automatically outputs the log to a file

2018-03-16 10:06:54	Jesse	I'm gonna take a look now about what we can do to our project for submission 3. 
2018-03-16 10:13:12	Jesse	Nobody but me used cardsTest.py right? would you guys mind if I deleted that file? 
2018-03-16 10:17:46	Jesse	We may want to ask the professor about this... I worry our games are too different. 
2018-03-17 00:11:58	ajshryoc	You can delete cardsTest.py if no one is using it. I would probably make a new directory in the git repo called 'project3' or something so that we have a record of both of our submissions. As for the issues with the games, if you want to ask him, go ahead. I think we could make it work but I'm sure he could provide some insight. <--- Sorry typed this up about 14 hours ago and never hit send 
2018-03-19 14:19:24	Jesse	We got a 90% it seems on what we submitted for the project. He said he liked our nouns/verbs but was disappointed that we didn't make an FSM. He also linked "Derive Interfaces from Constraints of Data" as if its some reading on moodle or github. 
2018-03-19 14:19:57	Jesse	... I checked both, and I'm not sure what he's talking about 
2018-03-19 14:36:38	ajshryoc	I'm also unsure what he meant by that. Our design did get a shoutout in #proj2_mar1 though so that's pretty cool 
2018-03-19 14:38:04	Jesse	i didn't see that. that is pretty cool 
2018-03-19 14:38:44	ajshryoc	Also, just realized the section the he references is also in that Google doc with the feedback 
2018-03-19 15:03:59	jwstanl3	Even after looking at that section, I'm still not sure what he wants us to get from that. The lines he references are where the suits are printed in Crazy Eights to allow the user to select which suit to change to. I don't get how that could be changed. 
2018-03-19 16:30:23	ajshryoc	It could definitely be made better. I think the whole system, crazy eights especially, could benefit from state machines. I intended to cleanup some of that code, but I decided to just wait until this upcoming submission. I'll take a better look at the comments later 
2018-03-19 17:59:01	Jesse	I'm not sure I know how the system could be improved with FSMs. But if you know what you'd like to change, I could definitely help out with that. The issue I see with FSMs is that only crazy eights would use it... and it would just be wasted code for solitaire. 
2018-03-19 19:10:58	ajshryoc	I'm sure he'll provide more context tomorrow. I'll review their comments too and we can go from there 
2018-03-20 10:11:37	Jesse	Hey guys, I was checking out a few other peoples code, and i found one where they built the FSM setup stuff, and didn't call it anywhere in their code xD. I wonder if the graders caught it.

2018-03-28 20:46:28	Jesse	I get what you mean, and I tried coding that up last night, but I'm struggling with what should be classes vs methods vs variables, and how should all of these things be linked up together?   
2018-03-28 20:49:16	Jesse	I guess the obvious answer would be to have all states and transitions be their own classes... but it also doesn't make sense for them to be their own classes when they might only have one variable or one method... and if the method just says pass, it doesn't really make sense to even have that method... 
2018-03-28 20:50:07	Jesse	And so you take the approach of having strings be states and methods being transitions... which is exactly how our code is now.. 
2018-03-28 20:50:32	Jesse	That's where my confusion with this project is. 
2018-03-28 20:52:56	ajshryoc	Yes, you're right and I'm not 100% sure how this implementation would work either. But, a lot of that I think could be solved by how it's implemented. For example, the State class could have a default implementation of each of its methods that is just "pass", that way, if you don't need the method, you don't worry about it. 
2018-03-28 20:55:40	ajshryoc	I think that Start, Play, Goal, and Fail could each be subclasses of State. When, as an example, Crazy Eights goes to instantiate a Start state, it should just have to pass in a lambda body that sets up the game. So, it wouldn't even need to subclass a new Start state (although it could). I think that it would look something like this: 
2018-03-28 20:55:45	ajshryoc	`start = new StartState(onEntry=setupCrazyEights)` 
2018-03-28 20:56:46	ajshryoc	`game.fsm = new FSM(start=start, play=runGame, end=endGame)` 
2018-03-28 20:57:07	ajshryoc	Or something like that. I may be oversimplifying things but I think it's doable 
2018-03-28 21:01:18	Jesse	I'll give it another shot tonight and let you know how it ends up tomorrow 
2018-03-28 21:02:43	ajshryoc	Okay, I will take a look at it too 
2018-03-28 21:24:44	Jesse	@Jesse uploaded a file: https://plm18.slack.com/files/U8N7VJU30/F9Z06TD0X/fsm.py (fsm) 
2018-03-28 21:24:51	Jesse	does that look like a good start? 
2018-03-28 21:32:03	Jesse	I really like the idea of passing in lambda bodies to abstract functions... that solved some of my 'why' questions earlier.. but its still kinda confusin  
2018-03-28 21:32:17	ajshryoc	Yeah, I think so. For the lambdas you pass in, you should just be able to pass in a function that performs the 'move' operation  (edited)
2018-03-28 21:32:36	ajshryoc	But, yeah I agree it is a little confusing 
2018-03-28 21:59:24	Jesse	nevermind, this whole thing seems stupid again... its like we're just making 4 methods for the sake of calling the same methods we would have initially. We pass the functions into some abstract class which just calls those methods in the abstract class... why not just call the functions? 
2018-03-28 22:04:45	Jesse	This whole process isn't saving us any lines of code... and as far as run-time and memory goes, this is more inefficient than what we've coded. It's even more unreadable too since theres more files for future programmers to go through. 
2018-03-28 23:14:21	ajshryoc	I'm working through a test version of crazy eights using an FSM, so hopefully that will help clear things up (if it works) 
2018-04-02 16:59:46	Jesse	Would either of you be free tonight to work on the plm stuff? or at least be free to instruct me on how I can help with the plm stuff? (since I haven't been very helpful so far) 
2018-04-02 17:32:35	ajshryoc	I am not free tonight to meet, but I should be able to push a working version of Crazy Eights with the FSM. Hopefully that will clear things up on how to implement the games with an FSM. Do you have ideas on things to change other than re-implementing the games with an FSM? 
2018-04-02 17:53:32	Jesse	not really, but we also have a paper we have to write. If I cannot find any improvements to the code, I'll try to get started on that.

2018-04-02 18:49:50	ajshryoc	I committed what I have so far to the other branch. You're welcome to take a look at it and continue developing it if that interests you. My approach so far has been to shove as much of what we already had as possible into the FSM. When I get back later, I will probably start rebuilding some of the functions passed into the FSM from the ground up to get rid of any issues I am just completely overlooking from our first iteration  (edited)
2018-04-02 19:10:11	Jesse	I think I'm going to get all of the non-fsm stuff into the CrazyEights.py file so it can be a lil more organized.

2018-04-02 20:17:07	ajshryoc	I like that idea. I was originally going to just have two versions of Crazy Eights until I got the FSM one working and then copy that over into CrazyEights.py, but I like your separation of logic here. I think at the very least we could label the FSM specification as the "domain specific language" he's looking for especially now that it's separated. 
2018-04-02 20:17:52	ajshryoc	Like I said before, I'm going to try re-writing the game logic to make it better-suited to the FSM to hopefully get rid of the bugs 
2018-04-02 20:18:24	Jesse	ok. im makin some changes now so don't do anything big :P 
2018-04-02 20:19:16	ajshryoc	Okay, no problem. Anything specific you are looking at or I should avoid? 
2018-04-02 20:20:56	Jesse	im trying to have everything output to a log file. it's just annoying because of how python handles inheritance 
2018-04-02 20:29:47	Jesse	the stupidly annoying thing about the log file is that every object needs one, and I can't open the same file multiple times without problems I don't think. 
2018-04-02 20:35:00	Jesse	i just undid my changes. You're free to edit it 
2018-04-02 20:35:22	ajshryoc	I'm unfamiliar with logs in python. Is there a specific package for it that giving you trouble or just using file i/o? 
2018-04-02 20:35:46	Jesse	I tried both  
2018-04-02 20:37:07	Jesse	either way, it would make us have a ton of duplicated code if we tried to put it in there.  
2018-04-02 20:54:54	Jesse	im gonna try to implement the solitaire stuff like you have with the fsms 
2018-04-02 20:56:14	ajshryoc	Okay, how do you want to get the FSM code? I could merge to master or you could branch off of crazy-eights-fsm 
2018-04-02 20:57:07	Jesse	ill just branch off crazy-eights-fsm 
2018-04-02 21:59:48	Jesse	it doesn't look like the guards are being called. 
2018-04-02 21:59:50	Jesse	are they? 
2018-04-02 22:50:13	Jesse	theres some bugs in the solitaire fsm but its pretty much there. 
2018-04-02 23:14:14	Jesse	let me know if you guys are wanting to do the "bonus projects" that menzies just listed a couple hours ago. 
2018-04-02 23:51:15	ajshryoc	Yeah, they're being called for me. I accidentally was calling them in the state object declaration for awhile though because I had the syntax wrong 
2018-04-02 23:51:27	ajshryoc	I'll look more into the bonus projects tomorrow

2018-04-05 18:39:14	ajshryoc	Dang I didn't realize that would effect it 
2018-04-05 19:00:01	ajshryoc	I just tried deleting all the __pycache__ directories and everything still runs fine for me 
2018-04-05 19:00:29	Jesse	:( 
2018-04-05 19:00:40	ajshryoc	Are you running python3 or just python? I know Joseph had an issue with that 
2018-04-05 19:00:53	Jesse	3 
2018-04-05 19:01:15	ajshryoc	What's the error it gives you? 
2018-04-05 19:08:39	Jesse	no module found 
2018-04-05 19:11:31	Jesse	if I run the game from the __main__ method then it doesn't give me that error. 
2018-04-05 19:13:21	Jesse	but it has an issue with the logger I made. 
2018-04-05 19:16:27	Jesse	got it workin 
2018-04-05 19:21:18	ajshryoc	Okay, good. Sorry about the issues 
2018-04-05 19:21:45	Jesse	it's fine. The logger is working to one file. [:+1:1]

2018-04-06 15:23:12	Jesse	hey guys, what other changes were you guys wanting to add to the project. I might be able to get something done now, but I'd need to know what. 
2018-04-06 15:31:34	ajshryoc	Crazy eights could use some more refactoring if you're up for that. I think pulling out the UI components to another module would clean things up. I also think we should consider ways to get rid of the payload params for transitions and states. Maybe define a generic environment  (Game) that that state machine passes around and the guards/state functions all know about. Not sure how hard that would be to implement 
2018-04-06 16:08:02	Jesse	Sorry I'm getting distracted playing with my raspberry pi. I'll try to work on that a lil later today. 
2018-04-06 16:28:15	ajshryoc	No problem. Was just a suggestion for where to go from here 
2018-04-07 10:17:49	Jesse	passing around the game environment would be a little bit of a pain, but I think it's doable. I'll see if I can refactor crazy eights a bit more before I try to do the environment thing. 
2018-04-07 10:26:08	Jesse	why does crazy eights have a makeMove FSM? 
2018-04-07 10:26:15	Jesse	it seems redundant 
2018-04-07 10:31:20	Jesse	also it looks like someone was trying to undo my Logger.log methods and just put the string in input(). we cannot do this because then that input string will not be in our log.txt

2018-04-07 16:57:26	Jesse	I tried converting a lot of the Transition statements and State creation methods into a for loop, but to be honest, it didn't save me many lines of code, and had bugs that I couldn't figure out why it was happening. 
2018-04-07 16:58:54	Jesse	It seemed like it would've been a good idea since it's repetitive code, but it made it much harder to read. 
2018-04-07 17:00:51	Jesse	I've looked a lil into passing around a game object, but we would need to have a bunch of variables keeping track of who the current player is and who the next player is... the whole process seemed like it would defeat the purpose of the FSM andrew made.  
2018-04-10 12:05:22	Jesse	Hey Joseph, have you pushed the changes you were talking to me about on the bus? 
2018-04-10 12:07:47	Jesse	Also, I'll be available up until and after class to work on this if anyone wants to join me.

2018-04-10 12:32:44	jwstanl3	I pushed my work so far. I'm still working through the cards file to see what I can make concrete between the two games and what needs to be abstracted to subclasses. 
2018-04-10 12:34:29	Jesse	Thanks, I'm trying to make unit tests. 
2018-04-10 12:34:41	Jesse	although the import statements are a huge pain. 
2018-04-10 12:36:54	Jesse	I hate that python cares about what directory you're in whenever you start the program. 
2018-04-10 13:16:15	Jesse	I found a way to make all of our imports absolute rather than relative. We just have to make a virtual environment and give the users instructions to set it up.

2018-04-14 20:08:30	jwstanl3	I just pushed everything I've done so far. All of the FSM and game classes (e.g., machine, state, card, pile, deck) seem to be finished; I just want to test them a little more. I've implemented Solitaire with these classes and it seems to run fine. You can run it with test.py in the src folder. I'll move this into the main file later. I also need to move the Crazy Eights code into a new game class and then clean everything up. 
2018-04-14 20:24:44	ajshryoc	Cool. Just wanted to make sure we got your stuff in there before continuing to work on other parts of the project. Outside of the stuff you're working on, is there anything else you think we need to do before the submission? 
2018-04-14 23:22:57	Jesse	dont forget about the two logs per game. sorry ive been ignoring the past few messages, Ive been finishing up ENG 331. I should be coming back to raleigh some time tomorrow so let me know if you guys want to meet or anything. 
2018-04-16 08:09:05	Jesse	The project is due today. Let me know if you guys want me to do anything to help. We also need to remember to have a top-level directory called proj3 and have the 2 text transcripts of the games.. (which we could probably get away with using the ones we made last time.)

2018-04-16 14:35:53	Jesse	well dang. awesome dude!! Ill test it out after my next class, and I'll be willing to meet, but I dont think its entirely necessary unless there are problems. 
2018-04-16 14:47:40	ajshryoc	Yeah, i will test it out as well after class. I'm not super free tonight---could meet at around 430 to finish things up but that's about it

2018-03-16 10:06:54	Jesse	I'm gonna take a look now about what we can do to our project for submission 3. 
2018-03-16 10:13:12	Jesse	Nobody but me used cardsTest.py right? would you guys mind if I deleted that file? 
2018-03-16 10:17:46	Jesse	We may want to ask the professor about this... I worry our games are too different. 
2018-03-17 00:11:58	ajshryoc	You can delete cardsTest.py if no one is using it. I would probably make a new directory in the git repo called 'project3' or something so that we have a record of both of our submissions. As for the issues with the games, if you want to ask him, go ahead. I think we could make it work but I'm sure he could provide some insight. <--- Sorry typed this up about 14 hours ago and never hit send 
2018-03-19 14:19:24	Jesse	We got a 90% it seems on what we submitted for the project. He said he liked our nouns/verbs but was disappointed that we didn't make an FSM. He also linked "Derive Interfaces from Constraints of Data" as if its some reading on moodle or github. 
2018-03-19 14:19:57	Jesse	... I checked both, and I'm not sure what he's talking about 
2018-03-19 14:36:38	ajshryoc	I'm also unsure what he meant by that. Our design did get a shoutout in #proj2_mar1 though so that's pretty cool 
2018-03-19 14:38:04	Jesse	i didn't see that. that is pretty cool 
2018-03-19 14:38:44	ajshryoc	Also, just realized the section the he references is also in that Google doc with the feedback 
2018-03-19 15:03:59	jwstanl3	Even after looking at that section, I'm still not sure what he wants us to get from that. The lines he references are where the suits are printed in Crazy Eights to allow the user to select which suit to change to. I don't get how that could be changed. 
2018-03-19 16:30:23	ajshryoc	It could definitely be made better. I think the whole system, crazy eights especially, could benefit from state machines. I intended to cleanup some of that code, but I decided to just wait until this upcoming submission. I'll take a better look at the comments later 
2018-03-19 17:59:01	Jesse	I'm not sure I know how the system could be improved with FSMs. But if you know what you'd like to change, I could definitely help out with that. The issue I see with FSMs is that only crazy eights would use it... and it would just be wasted code for solitaire. 
2018-03-19 19:10:58	ajshryoc	I'm sure he'll provide more context tomorrow. I'll review their comments too and we can go from there 
2018-03-20 10:11:37	Jesse	Hey guys, I was checking out a few other peoples code, and i found one where they built the FSM setup stuff, and didn't call it anywhere in their code xD. I wonder if the graders caught it.

2018-03-28 20:46:28	Jesse	I get what you mean, and I tried coding that up last night, but I'm struggling with what should be classes vs methods vs variables, and how should all of these things be linked up together?   
2018-03-28 20:49:16	Jesse	I guess the obvious answer would be to have all states and transitions be their own classes... but it also doesn't make sense for them to be their own classes when they might only have one variable or one method... and if the method just says pass, it doesn't really make sense to even have that method... 
2018-03-28 20:50:07	Jesse	And so you take the approach of having strings be states and methods being transitions... which is exactly how our code is now.. 
2018-03-28 20:50:32	Jesse	That's where my confusion with this project is. 
2018-03-28 20:52:56	ajshryoc	Yes, you're right and I'm not 100% sure how this implementation would work either. But, a lot of that I think could be solved by how it's implemented. For example, the State class could have a default implementation of each of its methods that is just "pass", that way, if you don't need the method, you don't worry about it. 
2018-03-28 20:55:40	ajshryoc	I think that Start, Play, Goal, and Fail could each be subclasses of State. When, as an example, Crazy Eights goes to instantiate a Start state, it should just have to pass in a lambda body that sets up the game. So, it wouldn't even need to subclass a new Start state (although it could). I think that it would look something like this: 
2018-03-28 20:55:45	ajshryoc	`start = new StartState(onEntry=setupCrazyEights)` 
2018-03-28 20:56:46	ajshryoc	`game.fsm = new FSM(start=start, play=runGame, end=endGame)` 
2018-03-28 20:57:07	ajshryoc	Or something like that. I may be oversimplifying things but I think it's doable 
2018-03-28 21:01:18	Jesse	I'll give it another shot tonight and let you know how it ends up tomorrow 
2018-03-28 21:02:43	ajshryoc	Okay, I will take a look at it too 
2018-03-28 21:24:44	Jesse	@Jesse uploaded a file: https://plm18.slack.com/files/U8N7VJU30/F9Z06TD0X/fsm.py (fsm) 
2018-03-28 21:24:51	Jesse	does that look like a good start? 
2018-03-28 21:32:03	Jesse	I really like the idea of passing in lambda bodies to abstract functions... that solved some of my 'why' questions earlier.. but its still kinda confusin  
2018-03-28 21:32:17	ajshryoc	Yeah, I think so. For the lambdas you pass in, you should just be able to pass in a function that performs the 'move' operation  (edited)
2018-03-28 21:32:36	ajshryoc	But, yeah I agree it is a little confusing 
2018-03-28 21:59:24	Jesse	nevermind, this whole thing seems stupid again... its like we're just making 4 methods for the sake of calling the same methods we would have initially. We pass the functions into some abstract class which just calls those methods in the abstract class... why not just call the functions? 
2018-03-28 22:04:45	Jesse	This whole process isn't saving us any lines of code... and as far as run-time and memory goes, this is more inefficient than what we've coded. It's even more unreadable too since theres more files for future programmers to go through. 
2018-03-28 23:14:21	ajshryoc	I'm working through a test version of crazy eights using an FSM, so hopefully that will help clear things up (if it works) 
2018-04-02 16:59:46	Jesse	Would either of you be free tonight to work on the plm stuff? or at least be free to instruct me on how I can help with the plm stuff? (since I haven't been very helpful so far) 
2018-04-02 17:32:35	ajshryoc	I am not free tonight to meet, but I should be able to push a working version of Crazy Eights with the FSM. Hopefully that will clear things up on how to implement the games with an FSM. Do you have ideas on things to change other than re-implementing the games with an FSM? 
2018-04-02 17:53:32	Jesse	not really, but we also have a paper we have to write. If I cannot find any improvements to the code, I'll try to get started on that.

2018-04-02 18:49:50	ajshryoc	I committed what I have so far to the other branch. You're welcome to take a look at it and continue developing it if that interests you. My approach so far has been to shove as much of what we already had as possible into the FSM. When I get back later, I will probably start rebuilding some of the functions passed into the FSM from the ground up to get rid of any issues I am just completely overlooking from our first iteration  (edited)
2018-04-02 19:10:11	Jesse	I think I'm going to get all of the non-fsm stuff into the CrazyEights.py file so it can be a lil more organized.

2018-04-02 20:17:07	ajshryoc	I like that idea. I was originally going to just have two versions of Crazy Eights until I got the FSM one working and then copy that over into CrazyEights.py, but I like your separation of logic here. I think at the very least we could label the FSM specification as the "domain specific language" he's looking for especially now that it's separated. 
2018-04-02 20:17:52	ajshryoc	Like I said before, I'm going to try re-writing the game logic to make it better-suited to the FSM to hopefully get rid of the bugs 
2018-04-02 20:18:24	Jesse	ok. im makin some changes now so don't do anything big :P 
2018-04-02 20:19:16	ajshryoc	Okay, no problem. Anything specific you are looking at or I should avoid? 
2018-04-02 20:20:56	Jesse	im trying to have everything output to a log file. it's just annoying because of how python handles inheritance 
2018-04-02 20:29:47	Jesse	the stupidly annoying thing about the log file is that every object needs one, and I can't open the same file multiple times without problems I don't think. 
2018-04-02 20:35:00	Jesse	i just undid my changes. You're free to edit it 
2018-04-02 20:35:22	ajshryoc	I'm unfamiliar with logs in python. Is there a specific package for it that giving you trouble or just using file i/o? 
2018-04-02 20:35:46	Jesse	I tried both  
2018-04-02 20:37:07	Jesse	either way, it would make us have a ton of duplicated code if we tried to put it in there.  
2018-04-02 20:54:54	Jesse	im gonna try to implement the solitaire stuff like you have with the fsms 
2018-04-02 20:56:14	ajshryoc	Okay, how do you want to get the FSM code? I could merge to master or you could branch off of crazy-eights-fsm 
2018-04-02 20:57:07	Jesse	ill just branch off crazy-eights-fsm 
2018-04-02 21:59:48	Jesse	it doesn't look like the guards are being called. 
2018-04-02 21:59:50	Jesse	are they? 
2018-04-02 22:50:13	Jesse	theres some bugs in the solitaire fsm but its pretty much there. 
2018-04-02 23:14:14	Jesse	let me know if you guys are wanting to do the "bonus projects" that menzies just listed a couple hours ago. 
2018-04-02 23:51:15	ajshryoc	Yeah, they're being called for me. I accidentally was calling them in the state object declaration for awhile though because I had the syntax wrong 
2018-04-02 23:51:27	ajshryoc	I'll look more into the bonus projects tomorrow

2018-04-05 18:11:41	Jesse	some of the package paths aren't working quite right on my system just pulling what you pushed from master 
2018-04-05 18:11:45	Jesse	I'll try to fix it. 
2018-04-05 18:21:58	ajshryoc	Sorry about that. Seemed to work for me

2018-04-05 18:37:19	ajshryoc	Yeah, it worked totally fine. Where's it tripping up? 
2018-04-05 18:37:57	Jesse	I would bet if you removed your __pycache__ directories, yours will be screwed up too 
2018-04-05 18:39:14	ajshryoc	Dang I didn't realize that would effect it 
2018-04-05 19:00:01	ajshryoc	I just tried deleting all the __pycache__ directories and everything still runs fine for me 
2018-04-05 19:00:29	Jesse	:(

2018-04-05 19:08:39	Jesse	no module found 
2018-04-05 19:11:31	Jesse	if I run the game from the __main__ method then it doesn't give me that error. 
2018-04-05 19:13:21	Jesse	but it has an issue with the logger I made. 
2018-04-05 19:16:27	Jesse	got it workin

2018-04-06 15:23:12	Jesse	hey guys, what other changes were you guys wanting to add to the project. I might be able to get something done now, but I'd need to know what. 
2018-04-06 15:31:34	ajshryoc	Crazy eights could use some more refactoring if you're up for that. I think pulling out the UI components to another module would clean things up. I also think we should consider ways to get rid of the payload params for transitions and states. Maybe define a generic environment  (Game) that that state machine passes around and the guards/state functions all know about. Not sure how hard that would be to implement 
2018-04-06 16:08:02	Jesse	Sorry I'm getting distracted playing with my raspberry pi. I'll try to work on that a lil later today. 
2018-04-06 16:28:15	ajshryoc	No problem. Was just a suggestion for where to go from here 
2018-04-07 10:17:49	Jesse	passing around the game environment would be a little bit of a pain, but I think it's doable. I'll see if I can refactor crazy eights a bit more before I try to do the environment thing. 
2018-04-07 10:26:08	Jesse	why does crazy eights have a makeMove FSM? 
2018-04-07 10:26:15	Jesse	it seems redundant 
2018-04-07 10:31:20	Jesse	also it looks like someone was trying to undo my Logger.log methods and just put the string in input(). we cannot do this because then that input string will not be in our log.txt

2018-04-07 16:57:26	Jesse	I tried converting a lot of the Transition statements and State creation methods into a for loop, but to be honest, it didn't save me many lines of code, and had bugs that I couldn't figure out why it was happening. 
2018-04-07 16:58:54	Jesse	It seemed like it would've been a good idea since it's repetitive code, but it made it much harder to read. 
2018-04-07 17:00:51	Jesse	I've looked a lil into passing around a game object, but we would need to have a bunch of variables keeping track of who the current player is and who the next player is... the whole process seemed like it would defeat the purpose of the FSM andrew made.  
2018-04-10 12:05:22	Jesse	Hey Joseph, have you pushed the changes you were talking to me about on the bus? 
2018-04-10 12:07:47	Jesse	Also, I'll be available up until and after class to work on this if anyone wants to join me.

2018-04-10 12:32:44	jwstanl3	I pushed my work so far. I'm still working through the cards file to see what I can make concrete between the two games and what needs to be abstracted to subclasses. 
2018-04-10 12:34:29	Jesse	Thanks, I'm trying to make unit tests. 
2018-04-10 12:34:41	Jesse	although the import statements are a huge pain. 
2018-04-10 12:36:54	Jesse	I hate that python cares about what directory you're in whenever you start the program. 
2018-04-10 13:16:15	Jesse	I found a way to make all of our imports absolute rather than relative. We just have to make a virtual environment and give the users instructions to set it up.

2018-04-14 20:08:30	jwstanl3	I just pushed everything I've done so far. All of the FSM and game classes (e.g., machine, state, card, pile, deck) seem to be finished; I just want to test them a little more. I've implemented Solitaire with these classes and it seems to run fine. You can run it with test.py in the src folder. I'll move this into the main file later. I also need to move the Crazy Eights code into a new game class and then clean everything up. 
2018-04-14 20:24:44	ajshryoc	Cool. Just wanted to make sure we got your stuff in there before continuing to work on other parts of the project. Outside of the stuff you're working on, is there anything else you think we need to do before the submission? 
2018-04-14 23:22:57	Jesse	dont forget about the two logs per game. sorry ive been ignoring the past few messages, Ive been finishing up ENG 331. I should be coming back to raleigh some time tomorrow so let me know if you guys want to meet or anything. 
2018-04-16 08:09:05	Jesse	The project is due today. Let me know if you guys want me to do anything to help. We also need to remember to have a top-level directory called proj3 and have the 2 text transcripts of the games.. (which we could probably get away with using the ones we made last time.)

2018-04-16 14:35:53	Jesse	well dang. awesome dude!! Ill test it out after my next class, and I'll be willing to meet, but I dont think its entirely necessary unless there are problems. 
2018-04-16 14:47:40	ajshryoc	Yeah, i will test it out as well after class. I'm not super free tonight---could meet at around 430 to finish things up but that's about it 
2018-04-16 16:33:47	Jesse	Everything seems to work fine. 
2018-04-16 16:35:23	Jesse	I don't think the front end changed since last time, so do you guys think we'll need to redo the logs? 
2018-04-16 16:35:51	Jesse	Also, I'm gonna make a dir called proj3 and put everything in it.

2018-03-16 10:06:54	Jesse	I'm gonna take a look now about what we can do to our project for submission 3. 
2018-03-16 10:13:12	Jesse	Nobody but me used cardsTest.py right? would you guys mind if I deleted that file? 
2018-03-16 10:17:46	Jesse	We may want to ask the professor about this... I worry our games are too different. 
2018-03-17 00:11:58	ajshryoc	You can delete cardsTest.py if no one is using it. I would probably make a new directory in the git repo called 'project3' or something so that we have a record of both of our submissions. As for the issues with the games, if you want to ask him, go ahead. I think we could make it work but I'm sure he could provide some insight. <--- Sorry typed this up about 14 hours ago and never hit send 
2018-03-19 14:19:24	Jesse	We got a 90% it seems on what we submitted for the project. He said he liked our nouns/verbs but was disappointed that we didn't make an FSM. He also linked "Derive Interfaces from Constraints of Data" as if its some reading on moodle or github. 
2018-03-19 14:19:57	Jesse	... I checked both, and I'm not sure what he's talking about 
2018-03-19 14:36:38	ajshryoc	I'm also unsure what he meant by that. Our design did get a shoutout in #proj2_mar1 though so that's pretty cool 
2018-03-19 14:38:04	Jesse	i didn't see that. that is pretty cool 
2018-03-19 14:38:44	ajshryoc	Also, just realized the section the he references is also in that Google doc with the feedback 
2018-03-19 15:03:59	jwstanl3	Even after looking at that section, I'm still not sure what he wants us to get from that. The lines he references are where the suits are printed in Crazy Eights to allow the user to select which suit to change to. I don't get how that could be changed. 
2018-03-19 16:30:23	ajshryoc	It could definitely be made better. I think the whole system, crazy eights especially, could benefit from state machines. I intended to cleanup some of that code, but I decided to just wait until this upcoming submission. I'll take a better look at the comments later 
2018-03-19 17:59:01	Jesse	I'm not sure I know how the system could be improved with FSMs. But if you know what you'd like to change, I could definitely help out with that. The issue I see with FSMs is that only crazy eights would use it... and it would just be wasted code for solitaire. 
2018-03-19 19:10:58	ajshryoc	I'm sure he'll provide more context tomorrow. I'll review their comments too and we can go from there 
2018-03-20 10:11:37	Jesse	Hey guys, I was checking out a few other peoples code, and i found one where they built the FSM setup stuff, and didn't call it anywhere in their code xD. I wonder if the graders caught it.

2018-03-28 20:46:28	Jesse	I get what you mean, and I tried coding that up last night, but I'm struggling with what should be classes vs methods vs variables, and how should all of these things be linked up together?   
2018-03-28 20:49:16	Jesse	I guess the obvious answer would be to have all states and transitions be their own classes... but it also doesn't make sense for them to be their own classes when they might only have one variable or one method... and if the method just says pass, it doesn't really make sense to even have that method... 
2018-03-28 20:50:07	Jesse	And so you take the approach of having strings be states and methods being transitions... which is exactly how our code is now.. 
2018-03-28 20:50:32	Jesse	That's where my confusion with this project is. 
2018-03-28 20:52:56	ajshryoc	Yes, you're right and I'm not 100% sure how this implementation would work either. But, a lot of that I think could be solved by how it's implemented. For example, the State class could have a default implementation of each of its methods that is just "pass", that way, if you don't need the method, you don't worry about it. 
2018-03-28 20:55:40	ajshryoc	I think that Start, Play, Goal, and Fail could each be subclasses of State. When, as an example, Crazy Eights goes to instantiate a Start state, it should just have to pass in a lambda body that sets up the game. So, it wouldn't even need to subclass a new Start state (although it could). I think that it would look something like this: 
2018-03-28 20:55:45	ajshryoc	`start = new StartState(onEntry=setupCrazyEights)` 
2018-03-28 20:56:46	ajshryoc	`game.fsm = new FSM(start=start, play=runGame, end=endGame)` 
2018-03-28 20:57:07	ajshryoc	Or something like that. I may be oversimplifying things but I think it's doable 
2018-03-28 21:01:18	Jesse	I'll give it another shot tonight and let you know how it ends up tomorrow 
2018-03-28 21:02:43	ajshryoc	Okay, I will take a look at it too 
2018-03-28 21:24:44	Jesse	@Jesse uploaded a file: https://plm18.slack.com/files/U8N7VJU30/F9Z06TD0X/fsm.py (fsm) 
2018-03-28 21:24:51	Jesse	does that look like a good start? 
2018-03-28 21:32:03	Jesse	I really like the idea of passing in lambda bodies to abstract functions... that solved some of my 'why' questions earlier.. but its still kinda confusin  
2018-03-28 21:32:17	ajshryoc	Yeah, I think so. For the lambdas you pass in, you should just be able to pass in a function that performs the 'move' operation  (edited)
2018-03-28 21:32:36	ajshryoc	But, yeah I agree it is a little confusing 
2018-03-28 21:59:24	Jesse	nevermind, this whole thing seems stupid again... its like we're just making 4 methods for the sake of calling the same methods we would have initially. We pass the functions into some abstract class which just calls those methods in the abstract class... why not just call the functions? 
2018-03-28 22:04:45	Jesse	This whole process isn't saving us any lines of code... and as far as run-time and memory goes, this is more inefficient than what we've coded. It's even more unreadable too since theres more files for future programmers to go through. 
2018-03-28 23:14:21	ajshryoc	I'm working through a test version of crazy eights using an FSM, so hopefully that will help clear things up (if it works) 
2018-04-02 16:59:46	Jesse	Would either of you be free tonight to work on the plm stuff? or at least be free to instruct me on how I can help with the plm stuff? (since I haven't been very helpful so far) 
2018-04-02 17:32:35	ajshryoc	I am not free tonight to meet, but I should be able to push a working version of Crazy Eights with the FSM. Hopefully that will clear things up on how to implement the games with an FSM. Do you have ideas on things to change other than re-implementing the games with an FSM? 
2018-04-02 17:53:32	Jesse	not really, but we also have a paper we have to write. If I cannot find any improvements to the code, I'll try to get started on that.

2018-04-02 18:49:50	ajshryoc	I committed what I have so far to the other branch. You're welcome to take a look at it and continue developing it if that interests you. My approach so far has been to shove as much of what we already had as possible into the FSM. When I get back later, I will probably start rebuilding some of the functions passed into the FSM from the ground up to get rid of any issues I am just completely overlooking from our first iteration  (edited)
2018-04-02 19:10:11	Jesse	I think I'm going to get all of the non-fsm stuff into the CrazyEights.py file so it can be a lil more organized.

2018-04-02 20:17:07	ajshryoc	I like that idea. I was originally going to just have two versions of Crazy Eights until I got the FSM one working and then copy that over into CrazyEights.py, but I like your separation of logic here. I think at the very least we could label the FSM specification as the "domain specific language" he's looking for especially now that it's separated. 
2018-04-02 20:17:52	ajshryoc	Like I said before, I'm going to try re-writing the game logic to make it better-suited to the FSM to hopefully get rid of the bugs 
2018-04-02 20:18:24	Jesse	ok. im makin some changes now so don't do anything big :P 
2018-04-02 20:19:16	ajshryoc	Okay, no problem. Anything specific you are looking at or I should avoid? 
2018-04-02 20:20:56	Jesse	im trying to have everything output to a log file. it's just annoying because of how python handles inheritance 
2018-04-02 20:29:47	Jesse	the stupidly annoying thing about the log file is that every object needs one, and I can't open the same file multiple times without problems I don't think. 
2018-04-02 20:35:00	Jesse	i just undid my changes. You're free to edit it 
2018-04-02 20:35:22	ajshryoc	I'm unfamiliar with logs in python. Is there a specific package for it that giving you trouble or just using file i/o? 
2018-04-02 20:35:46	Jesse	I tried both  
2018-04-02 20:37:07	Jesse	either way, it would make us have a ton of duplicated code if we tried to put it in there.  
2018-04-02 20:54:54	Jesse	im gonna try to implement the solitaire stuff like you have with the fsms 
2018-04-02 20:56:14	ajshryoc	Okay, how do you want to get the FSM code? I could merge to master or you could branch off of crazy-eights-fsm 
2018-04-02 20:57:07	Jesse	ill just branch off crazy-eights-fsm 
2018-04-02 21:59:48	Jesse	it doesn't look like the guards are being called. 
2018-04-02 21:59:50	Jesse	are they? 
2018-04-02 22:50:13	Jesse	theres some bugs in the solitaire fsm but its pretty much there.

2018-04-06 15:23:12	Jesse	hey guys, what other changes were you guys wanting to add to the project. I might be able to get something done now, but I'd need to know what. 
2018-04-06 15:31:34	ajshryoc	Crazy eights could use some more refactoring if you're up for that. I think pulling out the UI components to another module would clean things up. I also think we should consider ways to get rid of the payload params for transitions and states. Maybe define a generic environment  (Game) that that state machine passes around and the guards/state functions all know about. Not sure how hard that would be to implement 
2018-04-06 16:08:02	Jesse	Sorry I'm getting distracted playing with my raspberry pi. I'll try to work on that a lil later today. 
2018-04-06 16:28:15	ajshryoc	No problem. Was just a suggestion for where to go from here 
2018-04-07 10:17:49	Jesse	passing around the game environment would be a little bit of a pain, but I think it's doable. I'll see if I can refactor crazy eights a bit more before I try to do the environment thing. 
2018-04-07 10:26:08	Jesse	why does crazy eights have a makeMove FSM? 
2018-04-07 10:26:15	Jesse	it seems redundant 
2018-04-07 10:31:20	Jesse	also it looks like someone was trying to undo my Logger.log methods and just put the string in input(). we cannot do this because then that input string will not be in our log.txt

2018-04-07 16:57:26	Jesse	I tried converting a lot of the Transition statements and State creation methods into a for loop, but to be honest, it didn't save me many lines of code, and had bugs that I couldn't figure out why it was happening. 
2018-04-07 16:58:54	Jesse	It seemed like it would've been a good idea since it's repetitive code, but it made it much harder to read. 
2018-04-07 17:00:51	Jesse	I've looked a lil into passing around a game object, but we would need to have a bunch of variables keeping track of who the current player is and who the next player is... the whole process seemed like it would defeat the purpose of the FSM andrew made.  
2018-04-10 12:05:22	Jesse	Hey Joseph, have you pushed the changes you were talking to me about on the bus? 
2018-04-10 12:07:47	Jesse	Also, I'll be available up until and after class to work on this if anyone wants to join me.

2018-04-10 12:32:44	jwstanl3	I pushed my work so far. I'm still working through the cards file to see what I can make concrete between the two games and what needs to be abstracted to subclasses.

2018-04-10 12:34:41	Jesse	although the import statements are a huge pain. 
2018-04-10 12:36:54	Jesse	I hate that python cares about what directory you're in whenever you start the program. 
2018-04-10 13:16:15	Jesse	I found a way to make all of our imports absolute rather than relative. We just have to make a virtual environment and give the users instructions to set it up.

2018-04-14 20:08:30	jwstanl3	I just pushed everything I've done so far. All of the FSM and game classes (e.g., machine, state, card, pile, deck) seem to be finished; I just want to test them a little more. I've implemented Solitaire with these classes and it seems to run fine. You can run it with test.py in the src folder. I'll move this into the main file later. I also need to move the Crazy Eights code into a new game class and then clean everything up. 
2018-04-14 20:24:44	ajshryoc	Cool. Just wanted to make sure we got your stuff in there before continuing to work on other parts of the project. Outside of the stuff you're working on, is there anything else you think we need to do before the submission? 
2018-04-14 23:22:57	Jesse	dont forget about the two logs per game. sorry ive been ignoring the past few messages, Ive been finishing up ENG 331. I should be coming back to raleigh some time tomorrow so let me know if you guys want to meet or anything. 
2018-04-16 08:09:05	Jesse	The project is due today. Let me know if you guys want me to do anything to help. We also need to remember to have a top-level directory called proj3 and have the 2 text transcripts of the games.. (which we could probably get away with using the ones we made last time.)

2018-04-16 14:35:53	Jesse	well dang. awesome dude!! Ill test it out after my next class, and I'll be willing to meet, but I dont think its entirely necessary unless there are problems. 
2018-04-16 14:47:40	ajshryoc	Yeah, i will test it out as well after class. I'm not super free tonight---could meet at around 430 to finish things up but that's about it 
2018-04-16 16:33:47	Jesse	Everything seems to work fine.

I would probably make a new directory in the git repo called 'project3' or something so that we have a record of both of our submissions.

2018-03-19 14:19:57	Jesse	... I checked both, and I'm not sure what he's talking about 
2018-03-19 14:36:38	ajshryoc	I'm also unsure what he meant by that. Our design did get a shoutout in #proj2_mar1 though so that's pretty cool 
2018-03-19 14:38:04	Jesse	i didn't see that. that is pretty cool 
2018-03-19 14:38:44	ajshryoc	Also, just realized the section the he references is also in that Google doc with the feedback 
2018-03-19 15:03:59	jwstanl3	Even after looking at that section, I'm still not sure what he wants us to get from that. The lines he references are where the suits are printed in Crazy Eights to allow the user to select which suit to change to. I don't get how that could be changed. 
2018-03-19 16:30:23	ajshryoc	It could definitely be made better. I think the whole system, crazy eights especially, could benefit from state machines. I intended to cleanup some of that code, but I decided to just wait until this upcoming submission. I'll take a better look at the comments later 
2018-03-19 17:59:01	Jesse	I'm not sure I know how the system could be improved with FSMs. But if you know what you'd like to change, I could definitely help out with that. The issue I see with FSMs is that only crazy eights would use it... and it would just be wasted code for solitaire. 
2018-03-19 19:10:58	ajshryoc	I'm sure he'll provide more context tomorrow. I'll review their comments too and we can go from there 
2018-03-20 10:11:37	Jesse	Hey guys, I was checking out a few other peoples code, and i found one where they built the FSM setup stuff, and didn't call it anywhere in their code xD. I wonder if the graders caught it.

2018-03-28 20:46:28	Jesse	I get what you mean, and I tried coding that up last night, but I'm struggling with what should be classes vs methods vs variables, and how should all of these things be linked up together?   
2018-03-28 20:49:16	Jesse	I guess the obvious answer would be to have all states and transitions be their own classes... but it also doesn't make sense for them to be their own classes when they might only have one variable or one method... and if the method just says pass, it doesn't really make sense to even have that method... 
2018-03-28 20:50:07	Jesse	And so you take the approach of having strings be states and methods being transitions... which is exactly how our code is now.. 
2018-03-28 20:50:32	Jesse	That's where my confusion with this project is. 
2018-03-28 20:52:56	ajshryoc	Yes, you're right and I'm not 100% sure how this implementation would work either. But, a lot of that I think could be solved by how it's implemented. For example, the State class could have a default implementation of each of its methods that is just "pass", that way, if you don't need the method, you don't worry about it. 
2018-03-28 20:55:40	ajshryoc	I think that Start, Play, Goal, and Fail could each be subclasses of State. When, as an example, Crazy Eights goes to instantiate a Start state, it should just have to pass in a lambda body that sets up the game. So, it wouldn't even need to subclass a new Start state (although it could). I think that it would look something like this: 
2018-03-28 20:55:45	ajshryoc	`start = new StartState(onEntry=setupCrazyEights)` 
2018-03-28 20:56:46	ajshryoc	`game.fsm = new FSM(start=start, play=runGame, end=endGame)` 
2018-03-28 20:57:07	ajshryoc	Or something like that. I may be oversimplifying things but I think it's doable 
2018-03-28 21:01:18	Jesse	I'll give it another shot tonight and let you know how it ends up tomorrow 
2018-03-28 21:02:43	ajshryoc	Okay, I will take a look at it too 
2018-03-28 21:24:44	Jesse	@Jesse uploaded a file: https://plm18.slack.com/files/U8N7VJU30/F9Z06TD0X/fsm.py (fsm) 
2018-03-28 21:24:51	Jesse	does that look like a good start? 
2018-03-28 21:32:03	Jesse	I really like the idea of passing in lambda bodies to abstract functions... that solved some of my 'why' questions earlier.. but its still kinda confusin  
2018-03-28 21:32:17	ajshryoc	Yeah, I think so. For the lambdas you pass in, you should just be able to pass in a function that performs the 'move' operation  (edited)
2018-03-28 21:32:36	ajshryoc	But, yeah I agree it is a little confusing 
2018-03-28 21:59:24	Jesse	nevermind, this whole thing seems stupid again... its like we're just making 4 methods for the sake of calling the same methods we would have initially. We pass the functions into some abstract class which just calls those methods in the abstract class... why not just call the functions? 
2018-03-28 22:04:45	Jesse	This whole process isn't saving us any lines of code... and as far as run-time and memory goes, this is more inefficient than what we've coded. It's even more unreadable too since theres more files for future programmers to go through. 
2018-03-28 23:14:21	ajshryoc	I'm working through a test version of crazy eights using an FSM, so hopefully that will help clear things up (if it works) 
2018-04-02 16:59:46	Jesse	Would either of you be free tonight to work on the plm stuff? or at least be free to instruct me on how I can help with the plm stuff? (since I haven't been very helpful so far) 
2018-04-02 17:32:35	ajshryoc	I am not free tonight to meet, but I should be able to push a working version of Crazy Eights with the FSM. Hopefully that will clear things up on how to implement the games with an FSM. Do you have ideas on things to change other than re-implementing the games with an FSM? 
2018-04-02 17:53:32	Jesse	not really, but we also have a paper we have to write. If I cannot find any improvements to the code, I'll try to get started on that.

2018-04-02 18:49:50	ajshryoc	I committed what I have so far to the other branch. You're welcome to take a look at it and continue developing it if that interests you. My approach so far has been to shove as much of what we already had as possible into the FSM. When I get back later, I will probably start rebuilding some of the functions passed into the FSM from the ground up to get rid of any issues I am just completely overlooking from our first iteration  (edited)
2018-04-02 19:10:11	Jesse	I think I'm going to get all of the non-fsm stuff into the CrazyEights.py file so it can be a lil more organized.

2018-04-02 20:17:07	ajshryoc	I like that idea. I was originally going to just have two versions of Crazy Eights until I got the FSM one working and then copy that over into CrazyEights.py, but I like your separation of logic here. I think at the very least we could label the FSM specification as the "domain specific language" he's looking for especially now that it's separated. 
2018-04-02 20:17:52	ajshryoc	Like I said before, I'm going to try re-writing the game logic to make it better-suited to the FSM to hopefully get rid of the bugs 
2018-04-02 20:18:24	Jesse	ok. im makin some changes now so don't do anything big :P

2018-04-02 20:20:56	Jesse	im trying to have everything output to a log file. it's just annoying because of how python handles inheritance 
2018-04-02 20:29:47	Jesse	the stupidly annoying thing about the log file is that every object needs one, and I can't open the same file multiple times without problems I don't think. 
2018-04-02 20:35:00	Jesse	i just undid my changes. You're free to edit it 
2018-04-02 20:35:22	ajshryoc	I'm unfamiliar with logs in python. Is there a specific package for it that giving you trouble or just using file i/o? 
2018-04-02 20:35:46	Jesse	I tried both  
2018-04-02 20:37:07	Jesse	either way, it would make us have a ton of duplicated code if we tried to put it in there.

2018-04-02 20:56:14	ajshryoc	Okay, how do you want to get the FSM code? I could merge to master or you could branch off of crazy-eights-fsm 
2018-04-02 20:57:07	Jesse	ill just branch off crazy-eights-fsm

2018-04-06 15:23:12	Jesse	hey guys, what other changes were you guys wanting to add to the project. I might be able to get something done now, but I'd need to know what. 
2018-04-06 15:31:34	ajshryoc	Crazy eights could use some more refactoring if you're up for that. I think pulling out the UI components to another module would clean things up. I also think we should consider ways to get rid of the payload params for transitions and states. Maybe define a generic environment  (Game) that that state machine passes around and the guards/state functions all know about. Not sure how hard that would be to implement 
2018-04-06 16:08:02	Jesse	Sorry I'm getting distracted playing with my raspberry pi. I'll try to work on that a lil later today. 
2018-04-06 16:28:15	ajshryoc	No problem. Was just a suggestion for where to go from here 
2018-04-07 10:17:49	Jesse	passing around the game environment would be a little bit of a pain, but I think it's doable. I'll see if I can refactor crazy eights a bit more before I try to do the environment thing. 
2018-04-07 10:26:08	Jesse	why does crazy eights have a makeMove FSM? 
2018-04-07 10:26:15	Jesse	it seems redundant 
2018-04-07 10:31:20	Jesse	also it looks like someone was trying to undo my Logger.log methods and just put the string in input(). we cannot do this because then that input string will not be in our log.txt

2018-04-07 16:57:26	Jesse	I tried converting a lot of the Transition statements and State creation methods into a for loop, but to be honest, it didn't save me many lines of code, and had bugs that I couldn't figure out why it was happening. 
2018-04-07 16:58:54	Jesse	It seemed like it would've been a good idea since it's repetitive code, but it made it much harder to read. 
2018-04-07 17:00:51	Jesse	I've looked a lil into passing around a game object, but we would need to have a bunch of variables keeping track of who the current player is and who the next player is... the whole process seemed like it would defeat the purpose of the FSM andrew made.  
2018-04-10 12:05:22	Jesse	Hey Joseph, have you pushed the changes you were talking to me about on the bus? 
2018-04-10 12:07:47	Jesse	Also, I'll be available up until and after class to work on this if anyone wants to join me.

2018-04-10 12:32:44	jwstanl3	I pushed my work so far. I'm still working through the cards file to see what I can make concrete between the two games and what needs to be abstracted to subclasses. 
2018-04-10 12:34:29	Jesse	Thanks, I'm trying to make unit tests. 
2018-04-10 12:34:41	Jesse	although the import statements are a huge pain. 
2018-04-10 12:36:54	Jesse	I hate that python cares about what directory you're in whenever you start the program. 
2018-04-10 13:16:15	Jesse	I found a way to make all of our imports absolute rather than relative. We just have to make a virtual environment and give the users instructions to set it up.

2018-04-14 20:08:30	jwstanl3	I just pushed everything I've done so far. All of the FSM and game classes (e.g., machine, state, card, pile, deck) seem to be finished; I just want to test them a little more. I've implemented Solitaire with these classes and it seems to run fine. You can run it with test.py in the src folder. I'll move this into the main file later. I also need to move the Crazy Eights code into a new game class and then clean everything up. 
2018-04-14 20:24:44	ajshryoc	Cool. Just wanted to make sure we got your stuff in there before continuing to work on other parts of the project. Outside of the stuff you're working on, is there anything else you think we need to do before the submission? 
2018-04-14 23:22:57	Jesse	dont forget about the two logs per game. sorry ive been ignoring the past few messages, Ive been finishing up ENG 331. I should be coming back to raleigh some time tomorrow so let me know if you guys want to meet or anything. 
2018-04-16 08:09:05	Jesse	The project is due today. Let me know if you guys want me to do anything to help. We also need to remember to have a top-level directory called proj3 and have the 2 text transcripts of the games.. (which we could probably get away with using the ones we made last time.)

2018-04-16 14:35:53	Jesse	well dang. awesome dude!! Ill test it out after my next class, and I'll be willing to meet, but I dont think its entirely necessary unless there are problems. 
2018-04-16 14:47:40	ajshryoc	Yeah, i will test it out as well after class. I'm not super free tonight---could meet at around 430 to finish things up but that's about it 
2018-04-16 16:33:47	Jesse	Everything seems to work fine. 
2018-04-16 16:35:23	Jesse	I don't think the front end changed since last time, so do you guys think we'll need to redo the logs?

2018-04-16 17:14:42	ajshryoc	Looks good. Thanks for finishing that up. Someone asked in #proj3_apr13 about a google doc and the TA said we just need to submit on moodle a text file with instructions on the git repo

2018-04-16 20:47:03	Jesse	good catch! 
2018-04-17 11:51:27		getting channel history...
2018-03-19 14:19:57	Jesse	... I checked both, and I'm not sure what he's talking about 
2018-03-19 14:36:38	ajshryoc	I'm also unsure what he meant by that. Our design did get a shoutout in #proj2_mar1 though so that's pretty cool 
2018-03-19 14:38:04	Jesse	i didn't see that. that is pretty cool 
2018-03-19 14:38:44	ajshryoc	Also, just realized the section the he references is also in that Google doc with the feedback 
2018-03-19 15:03:59	jwstanl3	Even after looking at that section, I'm still not sure what he wants us to get from that. The lines he references are where the suits are printed in Crazy Eights to allow the user to select which suit to change to. I don't get how that could be changed. 
2018-03-19 16:30:23	ajshryoc	It could definitely be made better. I think the whole system, crazy eights especially, could benefit from state machines. I intended to cleanup some of that code, but I decided to just wait until this upcoming submission. I'll take a better look at the comments later 
2018-03-19 17:59:01	Jesse	I'm not sure I know how the system could be improved with FSMs. But if you know what you'd like to change, I could definitely help out with that. The issue I see with FSMs is that only crazy eights would use it... and it would just be wasted code for solitaire. 
2018-03-19 19:10:58	ajshryoc	I'm sure he'll provide more context tomorrow. I'll review their comments too and we can go from there 
2018-03-20 10:11:37	Jesse	Hey guys, I was checking out a few other peoples code, and i found one where they built the FSM setup stuff, and didn't call it anywhere in their code xD. I wonder if the graders caught it.

2018-03-28 20:46:28	Jesse	I get what you mean, and I tried coding that up last night, but I'm struggling with what should be classes vs methods vs variables, and how should all of these things be linked up together?   
2018-03-28 20:49:16	Jesse	I guess the obvious answer would be to have all states and transitions be their own classes... but it also doesn't make sense for them to be their own classes when they might only have one variable or one method... and if the method just says pass, it doesn't really make sense to even have that method... 
2018-03-28 20:50:07	Jesse	And so you take the approach of having strings be states and methods being transitions... which is exactly how our code is now.. 
2018-03-28 20:50:32	Jesse	That's where my confusion with this project is. 
2018-03-28 20:52:56	ajshryoc	Yes, you're right and I'm not 100% sure how this implementation would work either. But, a lot of that I think could be solved by how it's implemented. For example, the State class could have a default implementation of each of its methods that is just "pass", that way, if you don't need the method, you don't worry about it. 
2018-03-28 20:55:40	ajshryoc	I think that Start, Play, Goal, and Fail could each be subclasses of State. When, as an example, Crazy Eights goes to instantiate a Start state, it should just have to pass in a lambda body that sets up the game. So, it wouldn't even need to subclass a new Start state (although it could). I think that it would look something like this: 
2018-03-28 20:55:45	ajshryoc	`start = new StartState(onEntry=setupCrazyEights)` 
2018-03-28 20:56:46	ajshryoc	`game.fsm = new FSM(start=start, play=runGame, end=endGame)` 
2018-03-28 20:57:07	ajshryoc	Or something like that. I may be oversimplifying things but I think it's doable 
2018-03-28 21:01:18	Jesse	I'll give it another shot tonight and let you know how it ends up tomorrow 
2018-03-28 21:02:43	ajshryoc	Okay, I will take a look at it too 
2018-03-28 21:24:44	Jesse	@Jesse uploaded a file: https://plm18.slack.com/files/U8N7VJU30/F9Z06TD0X/fsm.py (fsm) 
2018-03-28 21:24:51	Jesse	does that look like a good start? 
2018-03-28 21:32:03	Jesse	I really like the idea of passing in lambda bodies to abstract functions... that solved some of my 'why' questions earlier.. but its still kinda confusin  
2018-03-28 21:32:17	ajshryoc	Yeah, I think so. For the lambdas you pass in, you should just be able to pass in a function that performs the 'move' operation  (edited)
2018-03-28 21:32:36	ajshryoc	But, yeah I agree it is a little confusing 
2018-03-28 21:59:24	Jesse	nevermind, this whole thing seems stupid again... its like we're just making 4 methods for the sake of calling the same methods we would have initially. We pass the functions into some abstract class which just calls those methods in the abstract class... why not just call the functions? 
2018-03-28 22:04:45	Jesse	This whole process isn't saving us any lines of code... and as far as run-time and memory goes, this is more inefficient than what we've coded. It's even more unreadable too since theres more files for future programmers to go through. 
2018-03-28 23:14:21	ajshryoc	I'm working through a test version of crazy eights using an FSM, so hopefully that will help clear things up (if it works) 
2018-04-02 16:59:46	Jesse	Would either of you be free tonight to work on the plm stuff? or at least be free to instruct me on how I can help with the plm stuff? (since I haven't been very helpful so far) 
2018-04-02 17:32:35	ajshryoc	I am not free tonight to meet, but I should be able to push a working version of Crazy Eights with the FSM. Hopefully that will clear things up on how to implement the games with an FSM. Do you have ideas on things to change other than re-implementing the games with an FSM? 
2018-04-02 17:53:32	Jesse	not really, but we also have a paper we have to write. If I cannot find any improvements to the code, I'll try to get started on that.

2018-04-02 18:49:50	ajshryoc	I committed what I have so far to the other branch. You're welcome to take a look at it and continue developing it if that interests you. My approach so far has been to shove as much of what we already had as possible into the FSM. When I get back later, I will probably start rebuilding some of the functions passed into the FSM from the ground up to get rid of any issues I am just completely overlooking from our first iteration  (edited)
2018-04-02 19:10:11	Jesse	I think I'm going to get all of the non-fsm stuff into the CrazyEights.py file so it can be a lil more organized.

2018-04-02 20:17:07	ajshryoc	I like that idea. I was originally going to just have two versions of Crazy Eights until I got the FSM one working and then copy that over into CrazyEights.py, but I like your separation of logic here. I think at the very least we could label the FSM specification as the "domain specific language" he's looking for especially now that it's separated. 
2018-04-02 20:17:52	ajshryoc	Like I said before, I'm going to try re-writing the game logic to make it better-suited to the FSM to hopefully get rid of the bugs 
2018-04-02 20:18:24	Jesse	ok. im makin some changes now so don't do anything big :P 
2018-04-02 20:19:16	ajshryoc	Okay, no problem. Anything specific you are looking at or I should avoid? 
2018-04-02 20:20:56	Jesse	im trying to have everything output to a log file. it's just annoying because of how python handles inheritance 
2018-04-02 20:29:47	Jesse	the stupidly annoying thing about the log file is that every object needs one, and I can't open the same file multiple times without problems I don't think. 
2018-04-02 20:35:00	Jesse	i just undid my changes. You're free to edit it 
2018-04-02 20:35:22	ajshryoc	I'm unfamiliar with logs in python. Is there a specific package for it that giving you trouble or just using file i/o? 
2018-04-02 20:35:46	Jesse	I tried both  
2018-04-02 20:37:07	Jesse	either way, it would make us have a ton of duplicated code if we tried to put it in there.  
2018-04-02 20:54:54	Jesse	im gonna try to implement the solitaire stuff like you have with the fsms 
2018-04-02 20:56:14	ajshryoc	Okay, how do you want to get the FSM code? I could merge to master or you could branch off of crazy-eights-fsm 
2018-04-02 20:57:07	Jesse	ill just branch off crazy-eights-fsm 
2018-04-02 21:59:48	Jesse	it doesn't look like the guards are being called. 
2018-04-02 21:59:50	Jesse	are they? 
2018-04-02 22:50:13	Jesse	theres some bugs in the solitaire fsm but its pretty much there.

2018-04-05 18:37:57	Jesse	I would bet if you removed your __pycache__ directories, yours will be screwed up too

2018-04-06 15:23:12	Jesse	hey guys, what other changes were you guys wanting to add to the project. I might be able to get something done now, but I'd need to know what. 
2018-04-06 15:31:34	ajshryoc	Crazy eights could use some more refactoring if you're up for that. I think pulling out the UI components to another module would clean things up. I also think we should consider ways to get rid of the payload params for transitions and states. Maybe define a generic environment  (Game) that that state machine passes around and the guards/state functions all know about. Not sure how hard that would be to implement 
2018-04-06 16:08:02	Jesse	Sorry I'm getting distracted playing with my raspberry pi. I'll try to work on that a lil later today. 
2018-04-06 16:28:15	ajshryoc	No problem. Was just a suggestion for where to go from here 
2018-04-07 10:17:49	Jesse	passing around the game environment would be a little bit of a pain, but I think it's doable. I'll see if I can refactor crazy eights a bit more before I try to do the environment thing. 
2018-04-07 10:26:08	Jesse	why does crazy eights have a makeMove FSM? 
2018-04-07 10:26:15	Jesse	it seems redundant 
2018-04-07 10:31:20	Jesse	also it looks like someone was trying to undo my Logger.log methods and just put the string in input(). we cannot do this because then that input string will not be in our log.txt

2018-04-07 16:57:26	Jesse	I tried converting a lot of the Transition statements and State creation methods into a for loop, but to be honest, it didn't save me many lines of code, and had bugs that I couldn't figure out why it was happening. 
2018-04-07 16:58:54	Jesse	It seemed like it would've been a good idea since it's repetitive code, but it made it much harder to read. 
2018-04-07 17:00:51	Jesse	I've looked a lil into passing around a game object, but we would need to have a bunch of variables keeping track of who the current player is and who the next player is... the whole process seemed like it would defeat the purpose of the FSM andrew made.  
2018-04-10 12:05:22	Jesse	Hey Joseph, have you pushed the changes you were talking to me about on the bus? 
2018-04-10 12:07:47	Jesse	Also, I'll be available up until and after class to work on this if anyone wants to join me.

2018-04-10 12:32:44	jwstanl3	I pushed my work so far. I'm still working through the cards file to see what I can make concrete between the two games and what needs to be abstracted to subclasses. 
2018-04-10 12:34:29	Jesse	Thanks, I'm trying to make unit tests. 
2018-04-10 12:34:41	Jesse	although the import statements are a huge pain. 
2018-04-10 12:36:54	Jesse	I hate that python cares about what directory you're in whenever you start the program. 
2018-04-10 13:16:15	Jesse	I found a way to make all of our imports absolute rather than relative. We just have to make a virtual environment and give the users instructions to set it up.

2018-04-14 20:08:30	jwstanl3	I just pushed everything I've done so far. All of the FSM and game classes (e.g., machine, state, card, pile, deck) seem to be finished; I just want to test them a little more. I've implemented Solitaire with these classes and it seems to run fine. You can run it with test.py in the src folder. I'll move this into the main file later. I also need to move the Crazy Eights code into a new game class and then clean everything up. 
2018-04-14 20:24:44	ajshryoc	Cool. Just wanted to make sure we got your stuff in there before continuing to work on other parts of the project. Outside of the stuff you're working on, is there anything else you think we need to do before the submission? 
2018-04-14 23:22:57	Jesse	dont forget about the two logs per game. sorry ive been ignoring the past few messages, Ive been finishing up ENG 331. I should be coming back to raleigh some time tomorrow so let me know if you guys want to meet or anything. 
2018-04-16 08:09:05	Jesse	The project is due today. Let me know if you guys want me to do anything to help. We also need to remember to have a top-level directory called proj3 and have the 2 text transcripts of the games.. (which we could probably get away with using the ones we made last time.)

2018-04-16 14:35:53	Jesse	well dang. awesome dude!! Ill test it out after my next class, and I'll be willing to meet, but I dont think its entirely necessary unless there are problems. 
2018-04-16 14:47:40	ajshryoc	Yeah, i will test it out as well after class. I'm not super free tonight---could meet at around 430 to finish things up but that's about it 
2018-04-16 16:33:47	Jesse	Everything seems to work fine.

2018-04-16 23:01:47	jwstanl3	I think that's the final commit that I'll do. I added documentation for the machine and game files. I didn't add any for the specific game files themselves because they build off the other classes and are easier to read through. I'm still going to look through them a little bit since I found a few minor mistakes in the other files. 
2018-04-16 23:03:22	Jesse	that's fine. thanks for doing as much as you have Joseph. 
2018-04-16 23:04:18	Jesse	same for you Andrew! 
2018-04-17 11:31:32	Jesse	did someone submit a link on moodle to our repo? 
2018-04-17 11:34:55	ajshryoc	Yeah, I submitted the readme 
2018-04-17 11:51:46	Jesse	sweet.  I was getting worried for a moment 
2018-04-18 15:57:08		getting channel history...
2018-03-19 14:36:38	ajshryoc	I'm also unsure what he meant by that. Our design did get a shoutout in #proj2_mar1 though so that's pretty cool 
2018-03-19 14:38:04	Jesse	i didn't see that. that is pretty cool 
2018-03-19 14:38:44	ajshryoc	Also, just realized the section the he references is also in that Google doc with the feedback 
2018-03-19 15:03:59	jwstanl3	Even after looking at that section, I'm still not sure what he wants us to get from that. The lines he references are where the suits are printed in Crazy Eights to allow the user to select which suit to change to. I don't get how that could be changed. 
2018-03-19 16:30:23	ajshryoc	It could definitely be made better. I think the whole system, crazy eights especially, could benefit from state machines. I intended to cleanup some of that code, but I decided to just wait until this upcoming submission. I'll take a better look at the comments later 
2018-03-19 17:59:01	Jesse	I'm not sure I know how the system could be improved with FSMs. But if you know what you'd like to change, I could definitely help out with that. The issue I see with FSMs is that only crazy eights would use it... and it would just be wasted code for solitaire. 
2018-03-19 19:10:58	ajshryoc	I'm sure he'll provide more context tomorrow. I'll review their comments too and we can go from there 
2018-03-20 10:11:37	Jesse	Hey guys, I was checking out a few other peoples code, and i found one where they built the FSM setup stuff, and didn't call it anywhere in their code xD. I wonder if the graders caught it.

2018-03-28 20:46:28	Jesse	I get what you mean, and I tried coding that up last night, but I'm struggling with what should be classes vs methods vs variables, and how should all of these things be linked up together?   
2018-03-28 20:49:16	Jesse	I guess the obvious answer would be to have all states and transitions be their own classes... but it also doesn't make sense for them to be their own classes when they might only have one variable or one method... and if the method just says pass, it doesn't really make sense to even have that method... 
2018-03-28 20:50:07	Jesse	And so you take the approach of having strings be states and methods being transitions... which is exactly how our code is now.. 
2018-03-28 20:50:32	Jesse	That's where my confusion with this project is. 
2018-03-28 20:52:56	ajshryoc	Yes, you're right and I'm not 100% sure how this implementation would work either. But, a lot of that I think could be solved by how it's implemented. For example, the State class could have a default implementation of each of its methods that is just "pass", that way, if you don't need the method, you don't worry about it. 
2018-03-28 20:55:40	ajshryoc	I think that Start, Play, Goal, and Fail could each be subclasses of State. When, as an example, Crazy Eights goes to instantiate a Start state, it should just have to pass in a lambda body that sets up the game. So, it wouldn't even need to subclass a new Start state (although it could). I think that it would look something like this: 
2018-03-28 20:55:45	ajshryoc	`start = new StartState(onEntry=setupCrazyEights)` 
2018-03-28 20:56:46	ajshryoc	`game.fsm = new FSM(start=start, play=runGame, end=endGame)` 
2018-03-28 20:57:07	ajshryoc	Or something like that. I may be oversimplifying things but I think it's doable 
2018-03-28 21:01:18	Jesse	I'll give it another shot tonight and let you know how it ends up tomorrow 
2018-03-28 21:02:43	ajshryoc	Okay, I will take a look at it too 
2018-03-28 21:24:44	Jesse	@Jesse uploaded a file: https://plm18.slack.com/files/U8N7VJU30/F9Z06TD0X/fsm.py (fsm) 
2018-03-28 21:24:51	Jesse	does that look like a good start? 
2018-03-28 21:32:03	Jesse	I really like the idea of passing in lambda bodies to abstract functions... that solved some of my 'why' questions earlier.. but its still kinda confusin  
2018-03-28 21:32:17	ajshryoc	Yeah, I think so. For the lambdas you pass in, you should just be able to pass in a function that performs the 'move' operation  (edited)
2018-03-28 21:32:36	ajshryoc	But, yeah I agree it is a little confusing 
2018-03-28 21:59:24	Jesse	nevermind, this whole thing seems stupid again... its like we're just making 4 methods for the sake of calling the same methods we would have initially. We pass the functions into some abstract class which just calls those methods in the abstract class... why not just call the functions? 
2018-03-28 22:04:45	Jesse	This whole process isn't saving us any lines of code... and as far as run-time and memory goes, this is more inefficient than what we've coded. It's even more unreadable too since theres more files for future programmers to go through. 
2018-03-28 23:14:21	ajshryoc	I'm working through a test version of crazy eights using an FSM, so hopefully that will help clear things up (if it works) 
2018-04-02 16:59:46	Jesse	Would either of you be free tonight to work on the plm stuff? or at least be free to instruct me on how I can help with the plm stuff? (since I haven't been very helpful so far) 
2018-04-02 17:32:35	ajshryoc	I am not free tonight to meet, but I should be able to push a working version of Crazy Eights with the FSM. Hopefully that will clear things up on how to implement the games with an FSM. Do you have ideas on things to change other than re-implementing the games with an FSM? 
2018-04-02 17:53:32	Jesse	not really, but we also have a paper we have to write. If I cannot find any improvements to the code, I'll try to get started on that.

2018-04-02 18:49:50	ajshryoc	I committed what I have so far to the other branch. You're welcome to take a look at it and continue developing it if that interests you. My approach so far has been to shove as much of what we already had as possible into the FSM. When I get back later, I will probably start rebuilding some of the functions passed into the FSM from the ground up to get rid of any issues I am just completely overlooking from our first iteration  (edited)
2018-04-02 19:10:11	Jesse	I think I'm going to get all of the non-fsm stuff into the CrazyEights.py file so it can be a lil more organized.

2018-04-02 20:17:07	ajshryoc	I like that idea. I was originally going to just have two versions of Crazy Eights until I got the FSM one working and then copy that over into CrazyEights.py, but I like your separation of logic here. I think at the very least we could label the FSM specification as the "domain specific language" he's looking for especially now that it's separated. 
2018-04-02 20:17:52	ajshryoc	Like I said before, I'm going to try re-writing the game logic to make it better-suited to the FSM to hopefully get rid of the bugs

2018-04-02 20:20:56	Jesse	im trying to have everything output to a log file. it's just annoying because of how python handles inheritance 
2018-04-02 20:29:47	Jesse	the stupidly annoying thing about the log file is that every object needs one, and I can't open the same file multiple times without problems I don't think. 
2018-04-02 20:35:00	Jesse	i just undid my changes. You're free to edit it 
2018-04-02 20:35:22	ajshryoc	I'm unfamiliar with logs in python. Is there a specific package for it that giving you trouble or just using file i/o? 
2018-04-02 20:35:46	Jesse	I tried both  
2018-04-02 20:37:07	Jesse	either way, it would make us have a ton of duplicated code if we tried to put it in there.

2018-04-02 20:56:14	ajshryoc	Okay, how do you want to get the FSM code? I could merge to master or you could branch off of crazy-eights-fsm 
2018-04-02 20:57:07	Jesse	ill just branch off crazy-eights-fsm

2018-04-03 20:35:10	Jesse	I'm going to try to get started on making the FSM code smaller like we discussed andrew. 
2018-04-03 20:39:49	ajshryoc	Okay, let me merge my changes and push what I have so that we're working with the same codebase 
2018-04-03 20:40:19	Jesse	ok. sorry if I merged the PR too soon 
2018-04-03 20:47:53	ajshryoc	Nah, you're all good  (edited)
2018-04-03 20:50:13	ajshryoc	I'll merge locally and push that 
2018-04-03 20:50:25	Jesse	cool 
2018-04-03 20:54:48	ajshryoc	I was actually wrong---I had pushed all my changes before class and your pull request merged everything. So, crazy-eights-fsm is up to date. I will merge that into master and we can work from there

2018-04-03 21:06:37	Jesse	sounds good 
2018-04-03 21:10:12	ajshryoc	Got it working for crazy eights. Do you want me to make the changes to solitaire too, or just push what I've got? Me making the changes might result in merge conflicts. All you should have to do is remove your "unused" parameters from any function that takes one 
2018-04-03 21:11:06	Jesse	you can make the changes to solitaire. I'm working out some changes that I'll probably need to revert anyway.

2018-04-06 15:23:12	Jesse	hey guys, what other changes were you guys wanting to add to the project. I might be able to get something done now, but I'd need to know what. 
2018-04-06 15:31:34	ajshryoc	Crazy eights could use some more refactoring if you're up for that. I think pulling out the UI components to another module would clean things up. I also think we should consider ways to get rid of the payload params for transitions and states. Maybe define a generic environment  (Game) that that state machine passes around and the guards/state functions all know about. Not sure how hard that would be to implement 
2018-04-06 16:08:02	Jesse	Sorry I'm getting distracted playing with my raspberry pi. I'll try to work on that a lil later today. 
2018-04-06 16:28:15	ajshryoc	No problem. Was just a suggestion for where to go from here 
2018-04-07 10:17:49	Jesse	passing around the game environment would be a little bit of a pain, but I think it's doable. I'll see if I can refactor crazy eights a bit more before I try to do the environment thing. 
2018-04-07 10:26:08	Jesse	why does crazy eights have a makeMove FSM? 
2018-04-07 10:26:15	Jesse	it seems redundant 
2018-04-07 10:31:20	Jesse	also it looks like someone was trying to undo my Logger.log methods and just put the string in input(). we cannot do this because then that input string will not be in our log.txt

2018-04-07 16:57:26	Jesse	I tried converting a lot of the Transition statements and State creation methods into a for loop, but to be honest, it didn't save me many lines of code, and had bugs that I couldn't figure out why it was happening. 
2018-04-07 16:58:54	Jesse	It seemed like it would've been a good idea since it's repetitive code, but it made it much harder to read. 
2018-04-07 17:00:51	Jesse	I've looked a lil into passing around a game object, but we would need to have a bunch of variables keeping track of who the current player is and who the next player is... the whole process seemed like it would defeat the purpose of the FSM andrew made.

2018-04-14 20:08:30	jwstanl3	I just pushed everything I've done so far. All of the FSM and game classes (e.g., machine, state, card, pile, deck) seem to be finished; I just want to test them a little more. I've implemented Solitaire with these classes and it seems to run fine. You can run it with test.py in the src folder. I'll move this into the main file later. I also need to move the Crazy Eights code into a new game class and then clean everything up. 
2018-04-14 20:24:44	ajshryoc	Cool. Just wanted to make sure we got your stuff in there before continuing to work on other parts of the project. Outside of the stuff you're working on, is there anything else you think we need to do before the submission? 
2018-04-14 23:22:57	Jesse	dont forget about the two logs per game. sorry ive been ignoring the past few messages, Ive been finishing up ENG 331. I should be coming back to raleigh some time tomorrow so let me know if you guys want to meet or anything. 
2018-04-16 08:09:05	Jesse	The project is due today. Let me know if you guys want me to do anything to help. We also need to remember to have a top-level directory called proj3 and have the 2 text transcripts of the games.. (which we could probably get away with using the ones we made last time.)

2018-04-16 14:19:17	jwstanl3	Both the games are finished. Try to play them and see if anything is wrong or formatted weird. I'm going to go back later and document some of the classes and methods. If you guys want to meet up later, we can go through the code and make sure everything is okay. 
2018-04-16 14:35:53	Jesse	well dang. awesome dude!! Ill test it out after my next class, and I'll be willing to meet, but I dont think its entirely necessary unless there are problems. 
2018-04-16 14:47:40	ajshryoc	Yeah, i will test it out as well after class. I'm not super free tonight---could meet at around 430 to finish things up but that's about it 
2018-04-16 16:33:47	Jesse	Everything seems to work fine. 
2018-04-16 16:35:23	Jesse	I don't think the front end changed since last time, so do you guys think we'll need to redo the logs? 
2018-04-16 16:35:51	Jesse	Also, I'm gonna make a dir called proj3 and put everything in it. 
2018-04-16 16:36:39	jwstanl3	I put new logs in the results folder

2018-04-16 23:01:47	jwstanl3	I think that's the final commit that I'll do. I added documentation for the machine and game files. I didn't add any for the specific game files themselves because they build off the other classes and are easier to read through. I'm still going to look through them a little bit since I found a few minor mistakes in the other files.

2018-03-28 20:46:28	Jesse	I get what you mean, and I tried coding that up last night, but I'm struggling with what should be classes vs methods vs variables, and how should all of these things be linked up together?   
2018-03-28 20:49:16	Jesse	I guess the obvious answer would be to have all states and transitions be their own classes... but it also doesn't make sense for them to be their own classes when they might only have one variable or one method... and if the method just says pass, it doesn't really make sense to even have that method... 
2018-03-28 20:50:07	Jesse	And so you take the approach of having strings be states and methods being transitions... which is exactly how our code is now.. 
2018-03-28 20:50:32	Jesse	That's where my confusion with this project is. 
2018-03-28 20:52:56	ajshryoc	Yes, you're right and I'm not 100% sure how this implementation would work either. But, a lot of that I think could be solved by how it's implemented. For example, the State class could have a default implementation of each of its methods that is just "pass", that way, if you don't need the method, you don't worry about it. 
2018-03-28 20:55:40	ajshryoc	I think that Start, Play, Goal, and Fail could each be subclasses of State. When, as an example, Crazy Eights goes to instantiate a Start state, it should just have to pass in a lambda body that sets up the game. So, it wouldn't even need to subclass a new Start state (although it could). I think that it would look something like this: 
2018-03-28 20:55:45	ajshryoc	`start = new StartState(onEntry=setupCrazyEights)` 
2018-03-28 20:56:46	ajshryoc	`game.fsm = new FSM(start=start, play=runGame, end=endGame)` 
2018-03-28 20:57:07	ajshryoc	Or something like that. I may be oversimplifying things but I think it's doable 
2018-03-28 21:01:18	Jesse	I'll give it another shot tonight and let you know how it ends up tomorrow 
2018-03-28 21:02:43	ajshryoc	Okay, I will take a look at it too 
2018-03-28 21:24:44	Jesse	@Jesse uploaded a file: https://plm18.slack.com/files/U8N7VJU30/F9Z06TD0X/fsm.py (fsm) 
2018-03-28 21:24:51	Jesse	does that look like a good start? 
2018-03-28 21:32:03	Jesse	I really like the idea of passing in lambda bodies to abstract functions... that solved some of my 'why' questions earlier.. but its still kinda confusin  
2018-03-28 21:32:17	ajshryoc	Yeah, I think so. For the lambdas you pass in, you should just be able to pass in a function that performs the 'move' operation  (edited)
2018-03-28 21:32:36	ajshryoc	But, yeah I agree it is a little confusing 
2018-03-28 21:59:24	Jesse	nevermind, this whole thing seems stupid again... its like we're just making 4 methods for the sake of calling the same methods we would have initially. We pass the functions into some abstract class which just calls those methods in the abstract class... why not just call the functions? 
2018-03-28 22:04:45	Jesse	This whole process isn't saving us any lines of code... and as far as run-time and memory goes, this is more inefficient than what we've coded. It's even more unreadable too since theres more files for future programmers to go through. 
2018-03-28 23:14:21	ajshryoc	I'm working through a test version of crazy eights using an FSM, so hopefully that will help clear things up (if it works) 
2018-04-02 16:59:46	Jesse	Would either of you be free tonight to work on the plm stuff? or at least be free to instruct me on how I can help with the plm stuff? (since I haven't been very helpful so far) 
2018-04-02 17:32:35	ajshryoc	I am not free tonight to meet, but I should be able to push a working version of Crazy Eights with the FSM. Hopefully that will clear things up on how to implement the games with an FSM. Do you have ideas on things to change other than re-implementing the games with an FSM? 
2018-04-02 17:53:32	Jesse	not really, but we also have a paper we have to write. If I cannot find any improvements to the code, I'll try to get started on that.

2018-04-02 18:49:50	ajshryoc	I committed what I have so far to the other branch. You're welcome to take a look at it and continue developing it if that interests you. My approach so far has been to shove as much of what we already had as possible into the FSM. When I get back later, I will probably start rebuilding some of the functions passed into the FSM from the ground up to get rid of any issues I am just completely overlooking from our first iteration  (edited)

2018-04-02 20:17:07	ajshryoc	I like that idea. I was originally going to just have two versions of Crazy Eights until I got the FSM one working and then copy that over into CrazyEights.py, but I like your separation of logic here. I think at the very least we could label the FSM specification as the "domain specific language" he's looking for especially now that it's separated. 
2018-04-02 20:17:52	ajshryoc	Like I said before, I'm going to try re-writing the game logic to make it better-suited to the FSM to hopefully get rid of the bugs

2018-04-02 20:20:56	Jesse	im trying to have everything output to a log file. it's just annoying because of how python handles inheritance 
2018-04-02 20:29:47	Jesse	the stupidly annoying thing about the log file is that every object needs one, and I can't open the same file multiple times without problems I don't think. 
2018-04-02 20:35:00	Jesse	i just undid my changes. You're free to edit it 
2018-04-02 20:35:22	ajshryoc	I'm unfamiliar with logs in python. Is there a specific package for it that giving you trouble or just using file i/o? 
2018-04-02 20:35:46	Jesse	I tried both  
2018-04-02 20:37:07	Jesse	either way, it would make us have a ton of duplicated code if we tried to put it in there.

2018-04-03 20:35:10	Jesse	I'm going to try to get started on making the FSM code smaller like we discussed andrew. 
2018-04-03 20:39:49	ajshryoc	Okay, let me merge my changes and push what I have so that we're working with the same codebase 
2018-04-03 20:40:19	Jesse	ok. sorry if I merged the PR too soon 
2018-04-03 20:47:53	ajshryoc	Nah, you're all good  (edited)

2018-04-03 20:54:48	ajshryoc	I was actually wrong---I had pushed all my changes before class and your pull request merged everything. So, crazy-eights-fsm is up to date. I will merge that into master and we can work from there

2018-04-03 21:11:06	Jesse	you can make the changes to solitaire. I'm working out some changes that I'll probably need to revert anyway.

2018-04-06 15:23:12	Jesse	hey guys, what other changes were you guys wanting to add to the project. I might be able to get something done now, but I'd need to know what. 
2018-04-06 15:31:34	ajshryoc	Crazy eights could use some more refactoring if you're up for that. I think pulling out the UI components to another module would clean things up. I also think we should consider ways to get rid of the payload params for transitions and states. Maybe define a generic environment  (Game) that that state machine passes around and the guards/state functions all know about. Not sure how hard that would be to implement 
2018-04-06 16:08:02	Jesse	Sorry I'm getting distracted playing with my raspberry pi. I'll try to work on that a lil later today. 
2018-04-06 16:28:15	ajshryoc	No problem. Was just a suggestion for where to go from here 
2018-04-07 10:17:49	Jesse	passing around the game environment would be a little bit of a pain, but I think it's doable. I'll see if I can refactor crazy eights a bit more before I try to do the environment thing. 
2018-04-07 10:26:08	Jesse	why does crazy eights have a makeMove FSM? 
2018-04-07 10:26:15	Jesse	it seems redundant 
2018-04-07 10:31:20	Jesse	also it looks like someone was trying to undo my Logger.log methods and just put the string in input(). we cannot do this because then that input string will not be in our log.txt

2018-04-07 16:57:26	Jesse	I tried converting a lot of the Transition statements and State creation methods into a for loop, but to be honest, it didn't save me many lines of code, and had bugs that I couldn't figure out why it was happening. 
2018-04-07 16:58:54	Jesse	It seemed like it would've been a good idea since it's repetitive code, but it made it much harder to read. 
2018-04-07 17:00:51	Jesse	I've looked a lil into passing around a game object, but we would need to have a bunch of variables keeping track of who the current player is and who the next player is... the whole process seemed like it would defeat the purpose of the FSM andrew made.

2018-04-10 12:36:54	Jesse	I hate that python cares about what directory you're in whenever you start the program. 
2018-04-10 13:16:15	Jesse	I found a way to make all of our imports absolute rather than relative. We just have to make a virtual environment and give the users instructions to set it up.

2018-04-14 20:08:30	jwstanl3	I just pushed everything I've done so far. All of the FSM and game classes (e.g., machine, state, card, pile, deck) seem to be finished; I just want to test them a little more. I've implemented Solitaire with these classes and it seems to run fine. You can run it with test.py in the src folder. I'll move this into the main file later. I also need to move the Crazy Eights code into a new game class and then clean everything up. 
2018-04-14 20:24:44	ajshryoc	Cool. Just wanted to make sure we got your stuff in there before continuing to work on other parts of the project. Outside of the stuff you're working on, is there anything else you think we need to do before the submission? 
2018-04-14 23:22:57	Jesse	dont forget about the two logs per game. sorry ive been ignoring the past few messages, Ive been finishing up ENG 331. I should be coming back to raleigh some time tomorrow so let me know if you guys want to meet or anything. 
2018-04-16 08:09:05	Jesse	The project is due today. Let me know if you guys want me to do anything to help. We also need to remember to have a top-level directory called proj3 and have the 2 text transcripts of the games.. (which we could probably get away with using the ones we made last time.)

2018-04-16 14:19:17	jwstanl3	Both the games are finished. Try to play them and see if anything is wrong or formatted weird. I'm going to go back later and document some of the classes and methods. If you guys want to meet up later, we can go through the code and make sure everything is okay. 
2018-04-16 14:35:53	Jesse	well dang. awesome dude!! Ill test it out after my next class, and I'll be willing to meet, but I dont think its entirely necessary unless there are problems. 
2018-04-16 14:47:40	ajshryoc	Yeah, i will test it out as well after class. I'm not super free tonight---could meet at around 430 to finish things up but that's about it 
2018-04-16 16:33:47	Jesse	Everything seems to work fine. 
2018-04-16 16:35:23	Jesse	I don't think the front end changed since last time, so do you guys think we'll need to redo the logs? 
2018-04-16 16:35:51	Jesse	Also, I'm gonna make a dir called proj3 and put everything in it. 
2018-04-16 16:36:39	jwstanl3	I put new logs in the results folder

2018-04-16 23:01:47	jwstanl3	I think that's the final commit that I'll do. I added documentation for the machine and game files. I didn't add any for the specific game files themselves because they build off the other classes and are easier to read through. I'm still going to look through them a little bit since I found a few minor mistakes in the other files. 
2018-04-16 23:03:22	Jesse	that's fine. thanks for doing as much as you have Joseph. 
2018-04-16 23:04:18	Jesse	same for you Andrew!

2018-04-17 11:34:55	ajshryoc	Yeah, I submitted the readme 
2018-04-17 11:51:46	Jesse	sweet.  I was getting worried for a moment 
2018-04-18 16:34:10	ajshryoc	@Jesse so I guess you were right about the whole due date over exams thing because they pushed everything back farther to May 10th 
2018-04-18 16:35:09	Jesse	yeah. Im still not completely satisfied though, since may 10th is still on an exam week.
2018-04-18 16:35:09		I guess im glad we got the extension. 
2018-04-18 16:43:40	ajshryoc	True. More time is better. Although, I'd (personally) like to be done with it before then since graduation is the 10th 
2018-04-18 16:46:34	Jesse	i agree. although I still feel like having the project due date on may 10th is unethical and a violation of that rule. 
2018-04-18 17:24:06	ajshryoc	It definitely is but the only other solution would be to cancel the project lol 
2018-04-18 17:24:24	ajshryoc	Not even really sure how the dates got so off track 
2018-04-18 17:24:36	ajshryoc	We never even remotely had an issue hitting them 
2018-04-18 17:25:01	Jesse	yeah. I updated adams, but if shes cool with the new due date, I wont complain. [:+1:1] 
2018-04-19 11:59:39	Jesse	She was cool with the new due date, so I no longer have an issue. 
2018-04-20 10:49:56		getting channel history...
2018-03-26 20:45:46	Jesse	hey guys, wanna meet up tomorrow to work on the plm project?

2018-03-26 21:59:18	Jesse	yeah

2018-03-28 20:46:28	Jesse	I get what you mean, and I tried coding that up last night, but I'm struggling with what should be classes vs methods vs variables, and how should all of these things be linked up together?   
2018-03-28 20:49:16	Jesse	I guess the obvious answer would be to have all states and transitions be their own classes... but it also doesn't make sense for them to be their own classes when they might only have one variable or one method... and if the method just says pass, it doesn't really make sense to even have that method... 
2018-03-28 20:50:07	Jesse	And so you take the approach of having strings be states and methods being transitions... which is exactly how our code is now.. 
2018-03-28 20:50:32	Jesse	That's where my confusion with this project is. 
2018-03-28 20:52:56	ajshryoc	Yes, you're right and I'm not 100% sure how this implementation would work either. But, a lot of that I think could be solved by how it's implemented. For example, the State class could have a default implementation of each of its methods that is just "pass", that way, if you don't need the method, you don't worry about it. 
2018-03-28 20:55:40	ajshryoc	I think that Start, Play, Goal, and Fail could each be subclasses of State. When, as an example, Crazy Eights goes to instantiate a Start state, it should just have to pass in a lambda body that sets up the game. So, it wouldn't even need to subclass a new Start state (although it could). I think that it would look something like this: 
2018-03-28 20:55:45	ajshryoc	`start = new StartState(onEntry=setupCrazyEights)` 
2018-03-28 20:56:46	ajshryoc	`game.fsm = new FSM(start=start, play=runGame, end=endGame)` 
2018-03-28 20:57:07	ajshryoc	Or something like that. I may be oversimplifying things but I think it's doable 
2018-03-28 21:01:18	Jesse	I'll give it another shot tonight and let you know how it ends up tomorrow 
2018-03-28 21:02:43	ajshryoc	Okay, I will take a look at it too 
2018-03-28 21:24:44	Jesse	@Jesse uploaded a file: https://plm18.slack.com/files/U8N7VJU30/F9Z06TD0X/fsm.py (fsm) 
2018-03-28 21:24:51	Jesse	does that look like a good start? 
2018-03-28 21:32:03	Jesse	I really like the idea of passing in lambda bodies to abstract functions... that solved some of my 'why' questions earlier.. but its still kinda confusin  
2018-03-28 21:32:17	ajshryoc	Yeah, I think so. For the lambdas you pass in, you should just be able to pass in a function that performs the 'move' operation  (edited)
2018-03-28 21:32:36	ajshryoc	But, yeah I agree it is a little confusing 
2018-03-28 21:59:24	Jesse	nevermind, this whole thing seems stupid again... its like we're just making 4 methods for the sake of calling the same methods we would have initially. We pass the functions into some abstract class which just calls those methods in the abstract class... why not just call the functions? 
2018-03-28 22:04:45	Jesse	This whole process isn't saving us any lines of code... and as far as run-time and memory goes, this is more inefficient than what we've coded. It's even more unreadable too since theres more files for future programmers to go through. 
2018-03-28 23:14:21	ajshryoc	I'm working through a test version of crazy eights using an FSM, so hopefully that will help clear things up (if it works) 
2018-04-02 16:59:46	Jesse	Would either of you be free tonight to work on the plm stuff? or at least be free to instruct me on how I can help with the plm stuff? (since I haven't been very helpful so far) 
2018-04-02 17:32:35	ajshryoc	I am not free tonight to meet, but I should be able to push a working version of Crazy Eights with the FSM. Hopefully that will clear things up on how to implement the games with an FSM. Do you have ideas on things to change other than re-implementing the games with an FSM? 
2018-04-02 17:53:32	Jesse	not really, but we also have a paper we have to write. If I cannot find any improvements to the code, I'll try to get started on that.

2018-04-02 18:49:50	ajshryoc	I committed what I have so far to the other branch. You're welcome to take a look at it and continue developing it if that interests you. My approach so far has been to shove as much of what we already had as possible into the FSM. When I get back later, I will probably start rebuilding some of the functions passed into the FSM from the ground up to get rid of any issues I am just completely overlooking from our first iteration  (edited)
2018-04-02 19:10:11	Jesse	I think I'm going to get all of the non-fsm stuff into the CrazyEights.py file so it can be a lil more organized.

2018-04-02 20:17:07	ajshryoc	I like that idea. I was originally going to just have two versions of Crazy Eights until I got the FSM one working and then copy that over into CrazyEights.py, but I like your separation of logic here. I think at the very least we could label the FSM specification as the "domain specific language" he's looking for especially now that it's separated. 
2018-04-02 20:17:52	ajshryoc	Like I said before, I'm going to try re-writing the game logic to make it better-suited to the FSM to hopefully get rid of the bugs

2018-04-02 20:19:16	ajshryoc	Okay, no problem. Anything specific you are looking at or I should avoid? 
2018-04-02 20:20:56	Jesse	im trying to have everything output to a log file. it's just annoying because of how python handles inheritance 
2018-04-02 20:29:47	Jesse	the stupidly annoying thing about the log file is that every object needs one, and I can't open the same file multiple times without problems I don't think. 
2018-04-02 20:35:00	Jesse	i just undid my changes. You're free to edit it 
2018-04-02 20:35:22	ajshryoc	I'm unfamiliar with logs in python. Is there a specific package for it that giving you trouble or just using file i/o? 
2018-04-02 20:35:46	Jesse	I tried both  
2018-04-02 20:37:07	Jesse	either way, it would make us have a ton of duplicated code if we tried to put it in there.

2018-04-02 20:56:14	ajshryoc	Okay, how do you want to get the FSM code? I could merge to master or you could branch off of crazy-eights-fsm 
2018-04-02 20:57:07	Jesse	ill just branch off crazy-eights-fsm

2018-04-03 20:35:10	Jesse	I'm going to try to get started on making the FSM code smaller like we discussed andrew. 
2018-04-03 20:39:49	ajshryoc	Okay, let me merge my changes and push what I have so that we're working with the same codebase 
2018-04-03 20:40:19	Jesse	ok. sorry if I merged the PR too soon 
2018-04-03 20:47:53	ajshryoc	Nah, you're all good  (edited)
2018-04-03 20:50:13	ajshryoc	I'll merge locally and push that 
2018-04-03 20:50:25	Jesse	cool 
2018-04-03 20:54:48	ajshryoc	I was actually wrong---I had pushed all my changes before class and your pull request merged everything. So, crazy-eights-fsm is up to date. I will merge that into master and we can work from there

2018-04-03 21:11:06	Jesse	you can make the changes to solitaire. I'm working out some changes that I'll probably need to revert anyway.

2018-04-06 15:23:12	Jesse	hey guys, what other changes were you guys wanting to add to the project. I might be able to get something done now, but I'd need to know what. 
2018-04-06 15:31:34	ajshryoc	Crazy eights could use some more refactoring if you're up for that. I think pulling out the UI components to another module would clean things up. I also think we should consider ways to get rid of the payload params for transitions and states. Maybe define a generic environment  (Game) that that state machine passes around and the guards/state functions all know about. Not sure how hard that would be to implement 
2018-04-06 16:08:02	Jesse	Sorry I'm getting distracted playing with my raspberry pi. I'll try to work on that a lil later today. 
2018-04-06 16:28:15	ajshryoc	No problem. Was just a suggestion for where to go from here 
2018-04-07 10:17:49	Jesse	passing around the game environment would be a little bit of a pain, but I think it's doable. I'll see if I can refactor crazy eights a bit more before I try to do the environment thing. 
2018-04-07 10:26:08	Jesse	why does crazy eights have a makeMove FSM? 
2018-04-07 10:26:15	Jesse	it seems redundant 
2018-04-07 10:31:20	Jesse	also it looks like someone was trying to undo my Logger.log methods and just put the string in input(). we cannot do this because then that input string will not be in our log.txt

2018-04-07 16:57:26	Jesse	I tried converting a lot of the Transition statements and State creation methods into a for loop, but to be honest, it didn't save me many lines of code, and had bugs that I couldn't figure out why it was happening. 
2018-04-07 16:58:54	Jesse	It seemed like it would've been a good idea since it's repetitive code, but it made it much harder to read. 
2018-04-07 17:00:51	Jesse	I've looked a lil into passing around a game object, but we would need to have a bunch of variables keeping track of who the current player is and who the next player is... the whole process seemed like it would defeat the purpose of the FSM andrew made.

2018-04-10 13:16:15	Jesse	I found a way to make all of our imports absolute rather than relative. We just have to make a virtual environment and give the users instructions to set it up.

2018-04-14 20:08:30	jwstanl3	I just pushed everything I've done so far. All of the FSM and game classes (e.g., machine, state, card, pile, deck) seem to be finished; I just want to test them a little more. I've implemented Solitaire with these classes and it seems to run fine. You can run it with test.py in the src folder. I'll move this into the main file later. I also need to move the Crazy Eights code into a new game class and then clean everything up. 
2018-04-14 20:24:44	ajshryoc	Cool. Just wanted to make sure we got your stuff in there before continuing to work on other parts of the project. Outside of the stuff you're working on, is there anything else you think we need to do before the submission? 
2018-04-14 23:22:57	Jesse	dont forget about the two logs per game. sorry ive been ignoring the past few messages, Ive been finishing up ENG 331. I should be coming back to raleigh some time tomorrow so let me know if you guys want to meet or anything. 
2018-04-16 08:09:05	Jesse	The project is due today. Let me know if you guys want me to do anything to help. We also need to remember to have a top-level directory called proj3 and have the 2 text transcripts of the games.. (which we could probably get away with using the ones we made last time.)

2018-04-16 14:19:17	jwstanl3	Both the games are finished. Try to play them and see if anything is wrong or formatted weird. I'm going to go back later and document some of the classes and methods. If you guys want to meet up later, we can go through the code and make sure everything is okay. 
2018-04-16 14:35:53	Jesse	well dang. awesome dude!! Ill test it out after my next class, and I'll be willing to meet, but I dont think its entirely necessary unless there are problems. 
2018-04-16 14:47:40	ajshryoc	Yeah, i will test it out as well after class. I'm not super free tonight---could meet at around 430 to finish things up but that's about it 
2018-04-16 16:33:47	Jesse	Everything seems to work fine. 
2018-04-16 16:35:23	Jesse	I don't think the front end changed since last time, so do you guys think we'll need to redo the logs? 
2018-04-16 16:35:51	Jesse	Also, I'm gonna make a dir called proj3 and put everything in it. 
2018-04-16 16:36:39	jwstanl3	I put new logs in the results folder

2018-04-16 23:01:47	jwstanl3	I think that's the final commit that I'll do. I added documentation for the machine and game files. I didn't add any for the specific game files themselves because they build off the other classes and are easier to read through. I'm still going to look through them a little bit since I found a few minor mistakes in the other files. 
2018-04-16 23:03:22	Jesse	that's fine. thanks for doing as much as you have Joseph. 
2018-04-16 23:04:18	Jesse	same for you Andrew! 
2018-04-17 11:31:32	Jesse	did someone submit a link on moodle to our repo? 
2018-04-17 11:34:55	ajshryoc	Yeah, I submitted the readme 
2018-04-17 11:51:46	Jesse	sweet.  I was getting worried for a moment 
2018-04-18 16:34:10	ajshryoc	@Jesse so I guess you were right about the whole due date over exams thing because they pushed everything back farther to May 10th 
2018-04-18 16:35:09	Jesse	yeah. Im still not completely satisfied though, since may 10th is still on an exam week.
2018-04-18 16:35:09		I guess im glad we got the extension. 
2018-04-18 16:43:40	ajshryoc	True. More time is better. Although, I'd (personally) like to be done with it before then since graduation is the 10th 
2018-04-18 16:46:34	Jesse	i agree. although I still feel like having the project due date on may 10th is unethical and a violation of that rule. 
2018-04-18 17:24:06	ajshryoc	It definitely is but the only other solution would be to cancel the project lol 
2018-04-18 17:24:24	ajshryoc	Not even really sure how the dates got so off track 
2018-04-18 17:24:36	ajshryoc	We never even remotely had an issue hitting them 
2018-04-18 17:25:01	Jesse	yeah. I updated adams, but if shes cool with the new due date, I wont complain. [:+1:1] 
2018-04-19 11:59:39	Jesse	She was cool with the new due date, so I no longer have an issue. [:+1:1] 
2018-04-19 23:46:51	Jesse	do you guys know when youre going to want to work on the PLM paper? 
2018-04-19 23:53:49	ajshryoc	I could definitely knock some of it out this weekend/early next week. After that, during finals 
2018-04-19 23:59:49	Jesse	yeah, same. it kinda depends on how tomorrow goes for me, cuz Im gonna try to completely knock out my game design project with my team :P 
2018-04-20 00:00:25	Jesse	if all goes well, I should be able to work on it starting Saturday or Sunday  (edited)
2018-04-20 00:03:07	ajshryoc	Yeah, hope that goes well. I don't think 5 pages of stuff will take us too long to do so time shouldn't be an issue 
2018-04-20 00:03:50	Jesse	did he specify  single spaced? 
2018-04-20 00:16:38	Jesse	it's in latex. 
2018-04-20 00:16:48	ajshryoc	He has a very specific format that were supposed to do 
2018-04-20 00:16:58	Jesse	also, apparently he wants a 9pt font 
2018-04-20 00:17:24	ajshryoc	I don't know if latex is required but he said he knows the format VERY well and would notice if it wasn't right 
2018-04-20 00:18:27	Jesse	if he knows it that well, he should just abstract out the common elements and make his own DSL for research papers lol. [:+1:1] 
2018-04-20 10:51:16	Jesse	I made a github repo for the essay in latex. If you guys all just wanted to use ShareLatex to edit it, we could contribute to it (i think) like a google docs. 
2018-04-20 10:51:56	Jesse	or we could just copy everything from whatever editor into git. 
2018-04-21 13:12:20	ajshryoc	Do you already have it setup in sharelatex? I've never worked with it 
2018-04-21 11:41:54		getting channel history...

2018-03-28 20:46:28	Jesse	I get what you mean, and I tried coding that up last night, but I'm struggling with what should be classes vs methods vs variables, and how should all of these things be linked up together?   
2018-03-28 20:49:16	Jesse	I guess the obvious answer would be to have all states and transitions be their own classes... but it also doesn't make sense for them to be their own classes when they might only have one variable or one method... and if the method just says pass, it doesn't really make sense to even have that method... 
2018-03-28 20:50:07	Jesse	And so you take the approach of having strings be states and methods being transitions... which is exactly how our code is now.. 
2018-03-28 20:50:32	Jesse	That's where my confusion with this project is. 
2018-03-28 20:52:56	ajshryoc	Yes, you're right and I'm not 100% sure how this implementation would work either. But, a lot of that I think could be solved by how it's implemented. For example, the State class could have a default implementation of each of its methods that is just "pass", that way, if you don't need the method, you don't worry about it. 
2018-03-28 20:55:40	ajshryoc	I think that Start, Play, Goal, and Fail could each be subclasses of State. When, as an example, Crazy Eights goes to instantiate a Start state, it should just have to pass in a lambda body that sets up the game. So, it wouldn't even need to subclass a new Start state (although it could). I think that it would look something like this: 
2018-03-28 20:55:45	ajshryoc	`start = new StartState(onEntry=setupCrazyEights)` 
2018-03-28 20:56:46	ajshryoc	`game.fsm = new FSM(start=start, play=runGame, end=endGame)` 
2018-03-28 20:57:07	ajshryoc	Or something like that. I may be oversimplifying things but I think it's doable 
2018-03-28 21:01:18	Jesse	I'll give it another shot tonight and let you know how it ends up tomorrow 
2018-03-28 21:02:43	ajshryoc	Okay, I will take a look at it too 
2018-03-28 21:24:44	Jesse	@Jesse uploaded a file: https://plm18.slack.com/files/U8N7VJU30/F9Z06TD0X/fsm.py (fsm) 
2018-03-28 21:24:51	Jesse	does that look like a good start? 
2018-03-28 21:32:03	Jesse	I really like the idea of passing in lambda bodies to abstract functions... that solved some of my 'why' questions earlier.. but its still kinda confusin  
2018-03-28 21:32:17	ajshryoc	Yeah, I think so. For the lambdas you pass in, you should just be able to pass in a function that performs the 'move' operation  (edited)
2018-03-28 21:32:36	ajshryoc	But, yeah I agree it is a little confusing 
2018-03-28 21:59:24	Jesse	nevermind, this whole thing seems stupid again... its like we're just making 4 methods for the sake of calling the same methods we would have initially. We pass the functions into some abstract class which just calls those methods in the abstract class... why not just call the functions? 
2018-03-28 22:04:45	Jesse	This whole process isn't saving us any lines of code... and as far as run-time and memory goes, this is more inefficient than what we've coded. It's even more unreadable too since theres more files for future programmers to go through. 
2018-03-28 23:14:21	ajshryoc	I'm working through a test version of crazy eights using an FSM, so hopefully that will help clear things up (if it works) 
2018-04-02 16:59:46	Jesse	Would either of you be free tonight to work on the plm stuff? or at least be free to instruct me on how I can help with the plm stuff? (since I haven't been very helpful so far) 
2018-04-02 17:32:35	ajshryoc	I am not free tonight to meet, but I should be able to push a working version of Crazy Eights with the FSM. Hopefully that will clear things up on how to implement the games with an FSM. Do you have ideas on things to change other than re-implementing the games with an FSM? 
2018-04-02 17:53:32	Jesse	not really, but we also have a paper we have to write. If I cannot find any improvements to the code, I'll try to get started on that.

2018-04-02 18:49:50	ajshryoc	I committed what I have so far to the other branch. You're welcome to take a look at it and continue developing it if that interests you. My approach so far has been to shove as much of what we already had as possible into the FSM. When I get back later, I will probably start rebuilding some of the functions passed into the FSM from the ground up to get rid of any issues I am just completely overlooking from our first iteration  (edited)

2018-04-02 20:17:07	ajshryoc	I like that idea. I was originally going to just have two versions of Crazy Eights until I got the FSM one working and then copy that over into CrazyEights.py, but I like your separation of logic here. I think at the very least we could label the FSM specification as the "domain specific language" he's looking for especially now that it's separated. 
2018-04-02 20:17:52	ajshryoc	Like I said before, I'm going to try re-writing the game logic to make it better-suited to the FSM to hopefully get rid of the bugs

2018-04-02 20:20:56	Jesse	im trying to have everything output to a log file. it's just annoying because of how python handles inheritance 
2018-04-02 20:29:47	Jesse	the stupidly annoying thing about the log file is that every object needs one, and I can't open the same file multiple times without problems I don't think. 
2018-04-02 20:35:00	Jesse	i just undid my changes. You're free to edit it 
2018-04-02 20:35:22	ajshryoc	I'm unfamiliar with logs in python. Is there a specific package for it that giving you trouble or just using file i/o? 
2018-04-02 20:35:46	Jesse	I tried both  
2018-04-02 20:37:07	Jesse	either way, it would make us have a ton of duplicated code if we tried to put it in there.  
2018-04-02 20:54:54	Jesse	im gonna try to implement the solitaire stuff like you have with the fsms 
2018-04-02 20:56:14	ajshryoc	Okay, how do you want to get the FSM code? I could merge to master or you could branch off of crazy-eights-fsm 
2018-04-02 20:57:07	Jesse	ill just branch off crazy-eights-fsm 
2018-04-02 21:59:48	Jesse	it doesn't look like the guards are being called.

2018-04-06 15:23:12	Jesse	hey guys, what other changes were you guys wanting to add to the project. I might be able to get something done now, but I'd need to know what. 
2018-04-06 15:31:34	ajshryoc	Crazy eights could use some more refactoring if you're up for that. I think pulling out the UI components to another module would clean things up. I also think we should consider ways to get rid of the payload params for transitions and states. Maybe define a generic environment  (Game) that that state machine passes around and the guards/state functions all know about. Not sure how hard that would be to implement 
2018-04-06 16:08:02	Jesse	Sorry I'm getting distracted playing with my raspberry pi. I'll try to work on that a lil later today. 
2018-04-06 16:28:15	ajshryoc	No problem. Was just a suggestion for where to go from here 
2018-04-07 10:17:49	Jesse	passing around the game environment would be a little bit of a pain, but I think it's doable. I'll see if I can refactor crazy eights a bit more before I try to do the environment thing. 
2018-04-07 10:26:08	Jesse	why does crazy eights have a makeMove FSM? 
2018-04-07 10:26:15	Jesse	it seems redundant 
2018-04-07 10:31:20	Jesse	also it looks like someone was trying to undo my Logger.log methods and just put the string in input(). we cannot do this because then that input string will not be in our log.txt

2018-04-07 16:57:26	Jesse	I tried converting a lot of the Transition statements and State creation methods into a for loop, but to be honest, it didn't save me many lines of code, and had bugs that I couldn't figure out why it was happening. 
2018-04-07 16:58:54	Jesse	It seemed like it would've been a good idea since it's repetitive code, but it made it much harder to read. 
2018-04-07 17:00:51	Jesse	I've looked a lil into passing around a game object, but we would need to have a bunch of variables keeping track of who the current player is and who the next player is... the whole process seemed like it would defeat the purpose of the FSM andrew made.

2018-04-10 13:16:15	Jesse	I found a way to make all of our imports absolute rather than relative. We just have to make a virtual environment and give the users instructions to set it up.

2018-04-14 20:08:30	jwstanl3	I just pushed everything I've done so far. All of the FSM and game classes (e.g., machine, state, card, pile, deck) seem to be finished; I just want to test them a little more. I've implemented Solitaire with these classes and it seems to run fine. You can run it with test.py in the src folder. I'll move this into the main file later. I also need to move the Crazy Eights code into a new game class and then clean everything up. 
2018-04-14 20:24:44	ajshryoc	Cool. Just wanted to make sure we got your stuff in there before continuing to work on other parts of the project. Outside of the stuff you're working on, is there anything else you think we need to do before the submission? 
2018-04-14 23:22:57	Jesse	dont forget about the two logs per game. sorry ive been ignoring the past few messages, Ive been finishing up ENG 331. I should be coming back to raleigh some time tomorrow so let me know if you guys want to meet or anything. 
2018-04-16 08:09:05	Jesse	The project is due today. Let me know if you guys want me to do anything to help. We also need to remember to have a top-level directory called proj3 and have the 2 text transcripts of the games.. (which we could probably get away with using the ones we made last time.)

2018-04-16 14:19:17	jwstanl3	Both the games are finished. Try to play them and see if anything is wrong or formatted weird. I'm going to go back later and document some of the classes and methods. If you guys want to meet up later, we can go through the code and make sure everything is okay. 
2018-04-16 14:35:53	Jesse	well dang. awesome dude!! Ill test it out after my next class, and I'll be willing to meet, but I dont think its entirely necessary unless there are problems. 
2018-04-16 14:47:40	ajshryoc	Yeah, i will test it out as well after class. I'm not super free tonight---could meet at around 430 to finish things up but that's about it 
2018-04-16 16:33:47	Jesse	Everything seems to work fine. 
2018-04-16 16:35:23	Jesse	I don't think the front end changed since last time, so do you guys think we'll need to redo the logs? 
2018-04-16 16:35:51	Jesse	Also, I'm gonna make a dir called proj3 and put everything in it. 
2018-04-16 16:36:39	jwstanl3	I put new logs in the results folder 
2018-04-16 16:42:29	Jesse	dang. you're awesome dude.

2018-04-16 23:01:47	jwstanl3	I think that's the final commit that I'll do. I added documentation for the machine and game files. I didn't add any for the specific game files themselves because they build off the other classes and are easier to read through. I'm still going to look through them a little bit since I found a few minor mistakes in the other files. 
2018-04-16 23:03:22	Jesse	that's fine. thanks for doing as much as you have Joseph. 
2018-04-16 23:04:18	Jesse	same for you Andrew! 
2018-04-17 11:31:32	Jesse	did someone submit a link on moodle to our repo? 
2018-04-17 11:34:55	ajshryoc	Yeah, I submitted the readme 
2018-04-17 11:51:46	Jesse	sweet.  I was getting worried for a moment 
2018-04-18 16:34:10	ajshryoc	@Jesse so I guess you were right about the whole due date over exams thing because they pushed everything back farther to May 10th 
2018-04-18 16:35:09	Jesse	yeah. Im still not completely satisfied though, since may 10th is still on an exam week.
2018-04-18 16:35:09		I guess im glad we got the extension. 
2018-04-18 16:43:40	ajshryoc	True. More time is better. Although, I'd (personally) like to be done with it before then since graduation is the 10th 
2018-04-18 16:46:34	Jesse	i agree. although I still feel like having the project due date on may 10th is unethical and a violation of that rule. 
2018-04-18 17:24:06	ajshryoc	It definitely is but the only other solution would be to cancel the project lol 
2018-04-18 17:24:24	ajshryoc	Not even really sure how the dates got so off track 
2018-04-18 17:24:36	ajshryoc	We never even remotely had an issue hitting them 
2018-04-18 17:25:01	Jesse	yeah. I updated adams, but if shes cool with the new due date, I wont complain. [:+1:1] 
2018-04-19 11:59:39	Jesse	She was cool with the new due date, so I no longer have an issue. [:+1:1] 
2018-04-19 23:46:51	Jesse	do you guys know when youre going to want to work on the PLM paper? 
2018-04-19 23:53:49	ajshryoc	I could definitely knock some of it out this weekend/early next week. After that, during finals 
2018-04-19 23:59:49	Jesse	yeah, same. it kinda depends on how tomorrow goes for me, cuz Im gonna try to completely knock out my game design project with my team :P 
2018-04-20 00:00:25	Jesse	if all goes well, I should be able to work on it starting Saturday or Sunday  (edited)
2018-04-20 00:03:07	ajshryoc	Yeah, hope that goes well. I don't think 5 pages of stuff will take us too long to do so time shouldn't be an issue 
2018-04-20 00:03:50	Jesse	did he specify  single spaced? 
2018-04-20 00:16:38	Jesse	it's in latex. 
2018-04-20 00:16:48	ajshryoc	He has a very specific format that were supposed to do 
2018-04-20 00:16:58	Jesse	also, apparently he wants a 9pt font 
2018-04-20 00:17:24	ajshryoc	I don't know if latex is required but he said he knows the format VERY well and would notice if it wasn't right 
2018-04-20 00:18:27	Jesse	if he knows it that well, he should just abstract out the common elements and make his own DSL for research papers lol. [:+1:1] 
2018-04-20 10:51:16	Jesse	I made a github repo for the essay in latex. If you guys all just wanted to use ShareLatex to edit it, we could contribute to it (i think) like a google docs. 
2018-04-20 10:51:56	Jesse	or we could just copy everything from whatever editor into git. 
2018-04-21 13:12:20	ajshryoc	Do you already have it setup in sharelatex? I've never worked with it 
2018-04-21 13:14:32	Jesse	I think I was wrong about the google docs thing. git's set up though 
2018-04-23 23:24:35	ajshryoc	I'm gonna let this one play out since a lot of people are already complaining about it and making good points. I don't mean to be equivocal about it, I just don't want to join a confrontation if I don't have to. I'll back you up on this if it comes up in our meeting tomorrow 
2018-04-23 23:28:36	Jesse	that seems smart. Im already a lil worried that dr. menzies is gonna treat/ grade me harsher since hes kinda blaming me for everything (based on his slack message). 
2018-04-24 16:31:49		getting channel history...
2018-04-02 20:35:46	Jesse	I tried both  
2018-04-02 20:37:07	Jesse	either way, it would make us have a ton of duplicated code if we tried to put it in there.  
2018-04-02 20:54:54	Jesse	im gonna try to implement the solitaire stuff like you have with the fsms 
2018-04-02 20:56:14	ajshryoc	Okay, how do you want to get the FSM code? I could merge to master or you could branch off of crazy-eights-fsm 
2018-04-02 20:57:07	Jesse	ill just branch off crazy-eights-fsm 
2018-04-02 21:59:48	Jesse	it doesn't look like the guards are being called. 
2018-04-02 21:59:50	Jesse	are they? 
2018-04-02 22:50:13	Jesse	theres some bugs in the solitaire fsm but its pretty much there. 
2018-04-02 23:14:14	Jesse	let me know if you guys are wanting to do the "bonus projects" that menzies just listed a couple hours ago. 
2018-04-02 23:51:15	ajshryoc	Yeah, they're being called for me. I accidentally was calling them in the state object declaration for awhile though because I had the syntax wrong 
2018-04-02 23:51:27	ajshryoc	I'll look more into the bonus projects tomorrow

2018-04-06 15:23:12	Jesse	hey guys, what other changes were you guys wanting to add to the project. I might be able to get something done now, but I'd need to know what. 
2018-04-06 15:31:34	ajshryoc	Crazy eights could use some more refactoring if you're up for that. I think pulling out the UI components to another module would clean things up. I also think we should consider ways to get rid of the payload params for transitions and states. Maybe define a generic environment  (Game) that that state machine passes around and the guards/state functions all know about. Not sure how hard that would be to implement 
2018-04-06 16:08:02	Jesse	Sorry I'm getting distracted playing with my raspberry pi. I'll try to work on that a lil later today. 
2018-04-06 16:28:15	ajshryoc	No problem. Was just a suggestion for where to go from here 
2018-04-07 10:17:49	Jesse	passing around the game environment would be a little bit of a pain, but I think it's doable. I'll see if I can refactor crazy eights a bit more before I try to do the environment thing. 
2018-04-07 10:26:08	Jesse	why does crazy eights have a makeMove FSM? 
2018-04-07 10:26:15	Jesse	it seems redundant 
2018-04-07 10:31:20	Jesse	also it looks like someone was trying to undo my Logger.log methods and just put the string in input(). we cannot do this because then that input string will not be in our log.txt

2018-04-07 16:57:26	Jesse	I tried converting a lot of the Transition statements and State creation methods into a for loop, but to be honest, it didn't save me many lines of code, and had bugs that I couldn't figure out why it was happening. 
2018-04-07 16:58:54	Jesse	It seemed like it would've been a good idea since it's repetitive code, but it made it much harder to read. 
2018-04-07 17:00:51	Jesse	I've looked a lil into passing around a game object, but we would need to have a bunch of variables keeping track of who the current player is and who the next player is... the whole process seemed like it would defeat the purpose of the FSM andrew made.  
2018-04-10 12:05:22	Jesse	Hey Joseph, have you pushed the changes you were talking to me about on the bus? 
2018-04-10 12:07:47	Jesse	Also, I'll be available up until and after class to work on this if anyone wants to join me.

2018-04-10 12:32:44	jwstanl3	I pushed my work so far. I'm still working through the cards file to see what I can make concrete between the two games and what needs to be abstracted to subclasses. 
2018-04-10 12:34:29	Jesse	Thanks, I'm trying to make unit tests. 
2018-04-10 12:34:41	Jesse	although the import statements are a huge pain. 
2018-04-10 12:36:54	Jesse	I hate that python cares about what directory you're in whenever you start the program. 
2018-04-10 13:16:15	Jesse	I found a way to make all of our imports absolute rather than relative. We just have to make a virtual environment and give the users instructions to set it up.

2018-04-14 20:08:30	jwstanl3	I just pushed everything I've done so far. All of the FSM and game classes (e.g., machine, state, card, pile, deck) seem to be finished; I just want to test them a little more. I've implemented Solitaire with these classes and it seems to run fine. You can run it with test.py in the src folder. I'll move this into the main file later. I also need to move the Crazy Eights code into a new game class and then clean everything up. 
2018-04-14 20:24:44	ajshryoc	Cool. Just wanted to make sure we got your stuff in there before continuing to work on other parts of the project. Outside of the stuff you're working on, is there anything else you think we need to do before the submission? 
2018-04-14 23:22:57	Jesse	dont forget about the two logs per game. sorry ive been ignoring the past few messages, Ive been finishing up ENG 331. I should be coming back to raleigh some time tomorrow so let me know if you guys want to meet or anything. 
2018-04-16 08:09:05	Jesse	The project is due today. Let me know if you guys want me to do anything to help. We also need to remember to have a top-level directory called proj3 and have the 2 text transcripts of the games.. (which we could probably get away with using the ones we made last time.)

2018-04-16 14:35:53	Jesse	well dang. awesome dude!! Ill test it out after my next class, and I'll be willing to meet, but I dont think its entirely necessary unless there are problems. 
2018-04-16 14:47:40	ajshryoc	Yeah, i will test it out as well after class. I'm not super free tonight---could meet at around 430 to finish things up but that's about it 
2018-04-16 16:33:47	Jesse	Everything seems to work fine. 
2018-04-16 16:35:23	Jesse	I don't think the front end changed since last time, so do you guys think we'll need to redo the logs?

2018-04-16 17:14:42	ajshryoc	Looks good. Thanks for finishing that up. Someone asked in #proj3_apr13 about a google doc and the TA said we just need to submit on moodle a text file with instructions on the git repo 
2018-04-16 17:14:50	ajshryoc	I can update the README and submit that

2018-04-16 23:01:47	jwstanl3	I think that's the final commit that I'll do. I added documentation for the machine and game files. I didn't add any for the specific game files themselves because they build off the other classes and are easier to read through. I'm still going to look through them a little bit since I found a few minor mistakes in the other files. 
2018-04-16 23:03:22	Jesse	that's fine. thanks for doing as much as you have Joseph. 
2018-04-16 23:04:18	Jesse	same for you Andrew! 
2018-04-17 11:31:32	Jesse	did someone submit a link on moodle to our repo? 
2018-04-17 11:34:55	ajshryoc	Yeah, I submitted the readme 
2018-04-17 11:51:46	Jesse	sweet.  I was getting worried for a moment 
2018-04-18 16:34:10	ajshryoc	@Jesse so I guess you were right about the whole due date over exams thing because they pushed everything back farther to May 10th 
2018-04-18 16:35:09	Jesse	yeah. Im still not completely satisfied though, since may 10th is still on an exam week.
2018-04-18 16:35:09		I guess im glad we got the extension. 
2018-04-18 16:43:40	ajshryoc	True. More time is better. Although, I'd (personally) like to be done with it before then since graduation is the 10th 
2018-04-18 16:46:34	Jesse	i agree. although I still feel like having the project due date on may 10th is unethical and a violation of that rule. 
2018-04-18 17:24:06	ajshryoc	It definitely is but the only other solution would be to cancel the project lol 
2018-04-18 17:24:24	ajshryoc	Not even really sure how the dates got so off track 
2018-04-18 17:24:36	ajshryoc	We never even remotely had an issue hitting them 
2018-04-18 17:25:01	Jesse	yeah. I updated adams, but if shes cool with the new due date, I wont complain. [:+1:1] 
2018-04-19 11:59:39	Jesse	She was cool with the new due date, so I no longer have an issue. [:+1:1] 
2018-04-19 23:46:51	Jesse	do you guys know when youre going to want to work on the PLM paper? 
2018-04-19 23:53:49	ajshryoc	I could definitely knock some of it out this weekend/early next week. After that, during finals 
2018-04-19 23:59:49	Jesse	yeah, same. it kinda depends on how tomorrow goes for me, cuz Im gonna try to completely knock out my game design project with my team :P 
2018-04-20 00:00:25	Jesse	if all goes well, I should be able to work on it starting Saturday or Sunday  (edited)
2018-04-20 00:03:07	ajshryoc	Yeah, hope that goes well. I don't think 5 pages of stuff will take us too long to do so time shouldn't be an issue 
2018-04-20 00:03:50	Jesse	did he specify  single spaced? 
2018-04-20 00:16:38	Jesse	it's in latex. 
2018-04-20 00:16:48	ajshryoc	He has a very specific format that were supposed to do 
2018-04-20 00:16:58	Jesse	also, apparently he wants a 9pt font 
2018-04-20 00:17:24	ajshryoc	I don't know if latex is required but he said he knows the format VERY well and would notice if it wasn't right 
2018-04-20 00:18:27	Jesse	if he knows it that well, he should just abstract out the common elements and make his own DSL for research papers lol. [:+1:1] 
2018-04-20 10:51:16	Jesse	I made a github repo for the essay in latex. If you guys all just wanted to use ShareLatex to edit it, we could contribute to it (i think) like a google docs. 
2018-04-20 10:51:56	Jesse	or we could just copy everything from whatever editor into git. 
2018-04-21 13:12:20	ajshryoc	Do you already have it setup in sharelatex? I've never worked with it 
2018-04-21 13:14:32	Jesse	I think I was wrong about the google docs thing. git's set up though [:+1:1] 
2018-04-23 11:14:20	Jesse	hey guys, ill let you guys decide when youd like to meet with menzies. id prefer tuesday if you guys can do then. 
2018-04-23 11:24:56	ajshryoc	Tuesday works for me 
2018-04-23 11:25:57	Jesse	ok. im going to class, could you put in a time slot for Tuesday? 
2018-04-23 11:26:39	ajshryoc	I put us down for 4pm Tuesday. We can go back and change if need be but most of the Tuesday slots Are taken so hopefully that works for everyone 
2018-04-23 11:26:55	Jesse	works for me 
2018-04-23 11:27:03	jwstanl3	That time should work for me 
2018-04-23 11:28:11	ajshryoc	Sweet. Hopefully the meeting won't be too bad. This'll give us some designated time to work on the paper too since no class 
2018-04-23 16:01:21	Jesse	if you guys want to complain about the essay and how its due on exam week, please complain to dr. menzies.  its against school policy, and dr. menzies isnt going to recognize the issue if its just me (i know cuz i tried) 
2018-04-23 16:01:42	Jesse	I'm trying to get others to complain to him too. 
2018-04-23 16:28:09	ajshryoc	Are you putting it in the classeval or complaining straight to him? 
2018-04-23 16:29:12	Jesse	straight to him. Ive been contacting others such as the head of csc, academic student affairs, dr. adams, and menzies, but theyve either ignored me or used sleazy tactics to evade the problem. 
2018-04-23 16:30:25	Jesse	if more people complain, itll be easier to convince menzies. 
2018-04-23 16:31:04	Jesse	https://policies.ncsu.edu/regulation/reg-02-20-14/ 
2018-04-23 16:43:59	Jesse	Ill still work on the essay with you tomorrow, andrew. 
2018-04-23 16:44:26	Jesse	:P i just want this issue to be taken seriously. 
2018-04-23 16:46:45	ajshryoc	I agree, it is definitely annoying to have this ignored by him. But yeah, we can work on the actual essay after our meeting with him 
2018-04-23 21:56:18	ajshryoc	@Jesse looks like a due date rebellion is happening in #general if you haven't seen... 
2018-04-23 21:57:10	Jesse	yeah ive been watching. I dont want to participate cuz I want menzies to see that it isnt just me. 
2018-04-23 21:57:19	Jesse	you should write too. 
2018-04-23 21:59:50	ajshryoc	I might if I see and opening. He just pulled out the official policy though and seems pretty set on it... 
2018-04-23 22:03:25	Jesse	He doesnt know the official policy 
2018-04-23 22:03:33	Jesse	hes just looking for a loophole. 
2018-04-23 22:29:08	Jesse	https://policies.ncsu.edu/regulation/reg-02-20-14/ 
2018-04-23 22:29:20	Jesse	thats the official policy if you want to see it. 
2018-04-23 22:41:58	ajshryoc	Nah, I totally agree with you that it's a loophole 
2018-04-23 22:43:24	Jesse	Im glad you do! it would help a lot if you either messaged in the general chat and/or messaged the dean. 
2018-04-23 23:24:35	ajshryoc	I'm gonna let this one play out since a lot of people are already complaining about it and making good points. I don't mean to be equivocal about it, I just don't want to join a confrontation if I don't have to. But, I will back you up on this if it comes up in our meeting tomorrow  (edited)
2018-04-23 23:28:36	Jesse	that seems smart. Im already a lil worried that dr. menzies is gonna treat/ grade me harsher since hes kinda blaming me for everything (based on his slack message). 
2018-04-24 12:29:35	ajshryoc	Anyone know Dr. Menzies' office number off the top of their head? Also, do we want to meet in the CSC department office lobby a few before 4? 
2018-04-24 12:35:48	ajshryoc	His office is 3298 EB2, so it's in the 3rd floor department office  (edited)
2018-04-24 12:43:24	Jesse	I dont know his office number. I was actually thinking  it would be in the classroom but i guess that doesnt make sense. 
2018-04-24 12:43:24		And yeah Im down to meet in the lobby around 3:50ish. 
2018-04-24 12:44:21	ajshryoc	I'll be there 
2018-04-24 14:27:22	jwstanl3	I just realized that I have a tutoring session from 3-4pm on main campus. They must've added it in the past couple of hours. So I may be able to get there late or not at all depending on the buses. 
2018-04-24 15:54:47	ajshryoc	In the CSC lobby on the 3rd floor now 
2018-04-24 16:25:34	jwstanl3	Are you guys still in the meeting? 
2018-04-24 16:27:32	ajshryoc	We finished a few minutes ago 
2018-04-24 16:29:08	ajshryoc	He just asked us very pointed questions about different features of our code. Some stuff we had. A lot of stuff he asked about we didn't have but I think we checked off enough boxes 
2018-04-24 16:32:43	Jesse	Yeah that sums it up pretty well. He said we had very clean python code, and we had the state machines, but we were lacking a lot of other stuff he has talked about in the class. 
2018-04-24 16:33:27	jwstanl3	Were we supposed to have multiple abstractions? 
2018-04-24 16:35:20	ajshryoc	No, he specifically said one big one and told us multiple times it was okay if we didn't have what he was asking for 
2018-04-24 16:36:28	ajshryoc	We had FSMs and OO plus clean python code. I imagine we'll get a similar grade as the first one 
2018-04-25 21:32:33	ajshryoc	Here are some options that haven't been taken already: rummy (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rummy), spider solitaire (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spider_(solitaire)), slapjack (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slapjack) 
2018-04-25 21:32:52	ajshryoc	Not sure how difficult these would be. Rummy would probably be the hardest to implement.

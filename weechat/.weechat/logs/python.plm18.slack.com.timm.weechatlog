2018-04-23 13:38:40	Jesse	Hey Dr. Menzies, I wanted to let you know that I still feel as though having a deadline on May 10th is a violation of NCSU's policy. Not only because it is during "Exam Weeks" (although, not necessarily the 'exam period'), but also because those policies to have an assignment due on either the week before exams or during exam weeks require approval from both the dean and head of computer science. Even if it is not necessarily on the 'exam period', we will still have to work on it during a time that NCSU has designated for studying (through those policies.) In my opinion, I think the third project should be dropped and that the first two projects should make up the 50% of our grade titled 'Projects'.  I have tried contacting the head of the department to ask her thoughts on this, but she has not responded to my messages. 
2018-04-23 18:26:57	timm	I'm a little unclear on the force of your argument . The third assignment (that you want to cancel) is a group project whose output is five pages. If they exam time period bothers you so much, why not do that work this week?  After all, my classes are cancelled (for project review).
2018-04-23 18:26:57		As to the feelings of the class. I mentioned the proposed timetable change to several students and watched their reaction. They seemed relieved.  So  on that matter, I have different information than you. 
2018-04-23 18:26:57		(But I don't mean to be rude or dismissive of your feelings of dissatisfaction. Your feelings are certainly your own and are valid.)
2018-04-23 18:26:57		As to procedures, I can speak with more precision on that. Firstly,  I made made time last week for a period of reflection and discussion and got zero feedback. Secondly,  NCSU policies do not preclude a may10 due date (see my last message).
2018-04-23 18:26:57		That said, this stuff is best done in person and not via messaging. Why don't you grab one of the slots and come talk to me about this?

2018-04-23 18:40:09	Jesse	It appears the only free time blocks are on friday, and by then, I imagine it wouldn't make sense for anything to be changed. 
2018-04-23 18:40:09		Working on the essay this week isn't a problem, but this week was not intended to be used for assignments. It was intended for studying since the previous rule on the policies page says that no assignments may be due on the week before the exam period (unless the date and the assignment were written on the syllabus). Knowing that they allocated both the week before exams, as well as the weeks of exams for studying, I find it hard to believe you and Dr. Adams both think it's right to have an assignment due where students would have to use that allocated time for this assignment as opposed to studying. 
2018-04-23 18:40:09		I think that if you were to go to other faculty members about this issue, such as the head of Computer Science as I have mentioned before or even other professors, I have a hard time believing that they would be okay with this assignment/deadline.
2018-04-23 18:40:09		As for other students, I could name the 5 people who have all complained about it without me prompting them to do so, but I don't really feel that would be right without their permission.

2018-03-16 14:31:31		getting channel history...
2017-09-26 12:58:59	jkayani	And you can always get a spot because everyone drops lol 
2017-09-26 15:00:26	carl	I really want to take CSC555   (edited)
2017-09-26 15:00:32	mrgray4	What's that? 
2017-09-26 15:00:42	carl	Social computing 
2017-09-26 15:01:02	mrgray4	Can you copy/paste the course desc? 
2017-09-26 15:01:05	mrgray4	If it's available 
2017-09-26 15:02:30	carl	A survey of the field of social computing, introducing its key concepts, paradigms, and techniques. Specific topics will be selected from the following list: social media, social network analysis, typology of social relationships, mobility and social context, human computation, crowdsourcing, prediction markets, organizational modeling, contracts, social norms, sociotechnical systems, social interpretation of information, formal argumentation, software engineering for social computing. 
2017-09-26 15:04:41	carl	Dr. Singh teaches it in the fall.  
2017-09-26 16:33:46	jkayani	Sounds great for you [:+1:1] 
2017-09-27 00:52:52	mrgray4	Just a fun factsie, I talked to two people who are in Singh's web services class right now, and they both said it is by far one of the worst comp sci classes they've taken? 
2017-09-27 00:53:23	mrgray4	That does sound interesting though Carl, especially relevant for you like Josh said 
2017-09-27 21:35:01	carl	Oh no that's not good!
2017-09-27 21:35:01		BTW courses come out October 11.  [:goshjosh:1] 
2017-10-03 09:16:25	jesse	would anyone like to study software engineering with me?  I think if I study alone, I'll end up cycling between tweaking my computer, staring at a wall, and cleaning my apartment. 
2017-10-03 10:49:23	jesse	Galen and I are meeting up at my apartment at around 5:30/6ish if anyone else wants to join 
2017-10-09 09:11:22	carl	Special topics for next semester: https://www.csc.ncsu.edu/courses/special_topics/
2017-10-09 09:11:22		Department of Computer Science at North Carolina State University
2017-10-09 09:11:22		Department of Computer Science at NC State University 
2017-10-10 12:38:40	mrgray4	Okay 002 sounds so cool 
2017-10-10 12:38:47	mrgray4	Doing the same program in 4 very different languages 
2017-10-10 12:38:50	mrgray4	Count me in 
2017-10-10 12:39:27	mrgray4	Also 007 
2017-10-10 12:43:17	nmcroutw	007 does look neat  
2017-10-10 13:25:07	jkayani	Where can you find your registration date on the new mypack?  (edited)
2017-10-10 13:25:45	jesse	on the student page on the button  
2017-10-10 13:26:01	jesse	planning and enrollment 
2017-10-10 13:26:44	jkayani	Oh ok it just wasn't marked lol, literally just said the date 
2017-10-10 13:27:36	jesse	mine says 1:00pm 10/26/2017 Enroll Apt:
2017-10-10 13:27:36		so its sorta labeled...  
2017-10-10 13:29:19	jkayani	@jkayani uploaded a file: https://sturgill-operators.slack.com/files/U3VP4JQPL/F7GA0KDU5/screenshot_20171010-132857.png (Screenshot_20171010-132857.png) and commented: No label at all haha 
2017-10-10 13:30:06	chrisaben	You signed the financial responsibility waiver first right? [:+1:1] 
2017-10-10 13:30:19	jkayani	Ooh no I haven't 
2017-10-10 13:30:24	jkayani	Good call 
2017-10-10 13:30:35	nmcroutw	It says October 20 @jkayani  
2017-10-10 13:31:16	chrisaben	^oh Yea, she's right :joy: 
2017-10-10 13:31:30	jkayani	No no I see that, I'm just saying the date has no label 
2017-10-10 13:31:56	jkayani	Like it doesn't say what that date is, it's literally just there so I have to infer thats what it means 
2017-10-10 13:32:08	chrisaben	Oh gotchu 
2017-10-10 13:32:43	jkayani	Silly MyPack 
2017-10-11 09:20:06	carl	I'm going to need to bribe whoever schedules software engineering 
2017-10-11 09:33:44	mrgray4	Hahaha why do you say that 
2017-10-11 09:34:05	mrgray4	Also who's hopping on that ethics train next semester? 
2017-10-11 09:34:27	carl	They scheduled it at the same time as a class I have to take with only one section offered. Again... [:confused:2 :cry:1] 
2017-10-11 09:34:31	jkayani	Ugh I have to do a reflection for that class and I didn't even go last time [:pensive:1] 
2017-10-11 09:34:59	mrgray4	You could do SE and Senior Design back to back semesters senior year 
2017-10-11 09:36:08	adyfrancis	Ethics: the only one credit hour class that's a bigger pain in the ass than my 3 credit hour classes [:+1:3] 
2017-10-11 09:36:30	mrgray4	Thanks for getting me excited :smile: 
2017-10-11 09:37:04	adyfrancis	I'm slight exaggerating but it is annoying  
2017-10-11 09:37:26	adyfrancis	Anyone have prof recommendations for Software Engineering? 
2017-10-11 09:39:17	chrisaben	I got a D- in that class because the teacher is the worst 
2017-10-11 09:39:43	adyfrancis	Shit there's only one professor  
2017-10-11 09:43:22	jkayani	A D- in ethics or SE @chrisaben ? 
2017-10-11 09:43:55	jkayani	SE with Heckman is good; although tbh your instructor doesn't seem to matter as much as your TAs 
2017-10-11 09:54:24	chrisaben	Ethics :joy: haven't taken SE yet 
2017-10-11 10:27:34	carl	Last semester, they changed the time for SE. Maybe they'll do it again.  
2017-10-11 10:28:50	adyfrancis	Is it MWThu this semester?  
2017-10-11 10:30:30	carl	Yes 
2017-10-11 10:32:03	nmcroutw	CSC 495 (007) had 80% A's. Sign me up 
2017-10-11 10:33:55	chrisaben	What 495 though? 
2017-10-11 10:34:39	adyfrancis	Visual interfaces for mobile devices  
2017-10-11 10:34:59	adyfrancis	Only 30 seats though  
2017-10-11 10:35:01	carl	I need to have two CSC electives completed to do senior design, so I'm not sure if pushing it back is a good idea.  
2017-10-11 11:19:20	carl	@carl uploaded a file: https://sturgill-operators.slack.com/files/U3V2J18QG/F7GPVBJDA/image.png (image.png) and commented: r8 my schedule 
2017-10-11 11:21:54	mrgray4	5/7 
2017-10-11 11:22:09	mrgray4	Your afternoons look so nice and free! 
2017-10-11 11:22:52	carl	That's the way I like it. I have class ending at 4:15 every day (M-Th) this semester and I'm not a fan. 
2017-10-11 11:27:49	carl	How many hours a week do y'all spend on CSC 326? 
2017-10-11 11:30:34	jesse	how many hours are in a week? 
2017-10-11 11:31:00	jkayani	Most of them 
2017-10-11 11:32:17	jesse	i would say i spent 40 to 50 each week on the last project. 
2017-10-11 11:32:25	carl	What is wrong this with class? :weary: 
2017-10-11 11:32:33	adyfrancis	Wtf 
2017-10-11 11:35:06	jesse	yeah. what I do, is get all my work for the other classes on one weekend day and then devote almost all my other time to software engineering. 
2017-10-11 11:35:50	carl	Someone should lead a strike. :thinking_face: 
2017-10-11 11:36:07	adyfrancis	Unionize the CSC class?? [:point_up:3] 
2017-10-11 11:38:39	carl	>  This course is based on reality, so the project will be as real-world as we can make it.... which might just mean that some aspects of the project may intentionally cause you some heartache (such as ill-defined AND/OR changing requirements). Remember, it's for your own good.
2017-10-11 11:38:39		Yeah, because every CSC grad is going to become a software engineer in industry... 
2017-10-11 11:42:24	chrisaben	I love how that is the course description though :joy: 
2017-10-11 11:46:34	adyfrancis	Is it that the projects are difficult to code? Or is it just a lot of components  
2017-10-11 11:48:01	chrisaben	I think it's just that the companies that assign them give really shitty requirements, unlike what we've been assigned in our other programming classes, and then they'll be like OH YEA WE'RE GONNA GO WITH THIS SHIT INSTEAD when you already spent several hours creating the component they originally wanted 
2017-10-11 11:49:04	mrgray4	@adyfrancis some bugs are difficult to find, but it's just a big ol pile of shit 
2017-10-11 11:49:06	mrgray4	as in a lot 
2017-10-11 11:49:22	jkayani	Delegating tasks and making sure everyone is in sync is the real challenge imo [:point_up:1] 
2017-10-11 11:49:23	carl	> the companies that assign them
2017-10-11 11:49:23		What does this mean? 
2017-10-11 11:49:37	jkayani	Especially when your team members are at different skill levels 
2017-10-11 11:50:04	jkayani	I had to hold my teammates hand the last 2 projects and it's exhausting 
2017-10-11 11:50:19	chrisaben	I heard that the projects are like company assignments? I may be thinking about senior design 
2017-10-11 11:50:37	chrisaben	Someone was describing the one of the classes in this way 
2017-10-11 11:50:48	mrgray4	Yep that's senior design 
2017-10-11 11:50:48	jkayani	Nah 326 you're multiple groups working on the same project to do the same things [:point_up:1] 
2017-10-11 11:51:06	jkayani	But it's separate code base per group 
2017-10-11 11:51:31	jkayani	So each group has an iTryst, and each group works too add the same bullshit to it 
2017-10-11 12:04:32	carl	Thinking from the perspective of The Communicative Constitution of Organization, it sounds like CSC 326 does almost everything wrong when it comes to the flow of communication. As the class seems to force organizational flexibility, I would assume that most groups never achieve an effective process of "organizational self-structuring" where they formalize their communication roles and methods. The class bypasses the "membership negotiation" communication flow by assigning random groups, which likely destroys the homogeneity of groups' goals and values. This makes it hard to define clear expectations for group members. Furthermore, this makes it even more difficult to be effective in the communication flow of "activity coordination" because members have little way of knowing the abilities and preferences of other group members. I would assume that there are also problems in "institutional positioning" because group assignments typically have one point of contact between the organization (the student group) and their publics (the teaching staff). This makes it challenging for the teaching staff to address imbalances in power and passion which is likely the driving force for decision-making in these groups. 
2017-10-11 12:05:00	carl	tl;dr not looking forward to this class at all 
2017-10-11 12:06:19	jkayani	You do get to pick your groups on the last, biggest project 
2017-10-11 12:06:42	carl	Based on this, the notion that the course is in any way reflective of the "real world" is folly because the communicative constitution of the student groups is fundamentally different from the communicative constitution of professional software development teams.  (edited)
2017-10-11 12:07:31	jkayani	And yeah there is 1 point of contact, but he's like a God in that he almost always has a solution and dedicates his life to this class [:point_up:1] 
2017-10-11 17:27:17	nmcroutw	Are any of you interning/working part time along with school? If so how many hours? I'm trying to decide if working 20 hours would be too much with classes 
2017-10-11 17:28:41	jesse	not me.  
2017-10-11 17:29:08	jkayani	I wouldn't do it 
2017-10-11 17:29:20	jkayani	For me anyway, with 326, hell no 
2017-10-11 17:29:24	carl	I'm working a few jobs currently. 20 hours definitely sounds like too much.  
2017-10-11 19:53:06	mrgray4	I like school and classes separate. Got offered for channeladvisor but turned it down for that reason. If you can go part time then maybe consider that if you?re not getting financial aid. Personally I?d say no 
2017-10-11 19:53:59	jesse	what is school without classes? :) 
2017-10-11 19:56:49	mbbennis	I'm doing 20 hours now, but I'm only in 11 hours of classes. I usually end up clocking a few hours under and I'm somehow less busy now than I have been in some full time semesters 
2017-10-11 19:57:06	mbbennis	But idk, it probably depends on the job 
2017-10-12 09:41:40	mrgray4	@mrgray4 uploaded a file: https://sturgill-operators.slack.com/files/U3WBH0F7G/F7GPV4MEV/screen_shot_2017-10-12_at_9.40.42_am.png (Screen Shot 2017-10-12 at 9.40.42 AM.png) and commented: Schedule ?\_(?)_/? . This will leave me with a CSC elective, a math elective, an other elective, and senior design (also a 100 fit level) 
2017-10-12 10:17:44	adyfrancis	To all my 495 homies https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TJmMcs4hGlp1lbd2BhCpUEZJBTnnhW5PdTZn0KHvSlc/edit 
2017-10-12 10:17:58	adyfrancis	Study guide  [:heart_eyes:1] 
2017-10-12 10:18:32	adyfrancis	P sure that's everything he can ask us  
2017-10-12 10:21:31	jesse	https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zEXElVJmPOV43AYAhHemp-UzrxOMfh2khvpZM4VallA/edit?usp=drivesdk 
2017-10-12 10:21:44	jesse	theres ours... but most of it is the same. 
2017-10-12 10:29:33	jesse	was the 'types of problems' what kowolenko talked about during the review day? 
2017-10-12 10:30:00	jesse	i was there but I didnt take notes on that. 
2017-10-12 10:30:07	adyfrancis	It was a part of the paper 
2017-10-12 10:30:38	adyfrancis	According to friends of my group mates who have taken the class before he asked "name 5 problems and give examples of each" 
2017-10-12 10:31:55	jesse	i dont recall us getting any paper. but I'll try to remember the ones in your sheet 
2017-10-12 10:32:22	adyfrancis	We were told to read a paper about types of problems  
2017-10-12 10:32:55	jesse	oh yeahhhh...  those readings  
2017-10-12 10:33:50	jesse	i didn't read them so that explains why it looked new 
2017-10-12 11:15:16	mrgray4	Hey I read that thing! I did a thing for once! [:+1::skin-tone-3:1] 
2017-10-16 10:03:53	nmcroutw	Is anyone in 401? How is it? 
2017-10-16 10:38:31	jkayani	Yeah 
2017-10-16 10:38:44	jkayani	It's alright - it can be a bit dry at times, b/c it's a lot of digging into protcols 
2017-10-17 10:11:19	adyfrancis	495 pals what are we supposed to talk about today? Something about data? 
2017-10-17 10:18:17	nmcroutw	We are presenting our databases. I wrote down we need to talk about schema, primary keys, and address formatting issues but idk exactly what all those are 
2017-10-17 10:19:03	adyfrancis	Yeah I wrote where I sourced data and primary keys for structured data but I was forgetting about the schema for unstructured  
2017-10-17 10:19:06	adyfrancis	Thanks! 
2017-10-19 15:37:21	mrgray4	Folks, I got the WillowTree internship!!! [:smile:3] 
2017-10-19 15:37:49	mrgray4	My recruiter had resigned leaving me in internship limbo, but I got through today and found out I have an offer :D 
2017-10-19 16:22:56	jesse	was the internship for a position as a recruiter? xD [:goshjosh:1] 
2017-10-19 16:23:07	jesse	congrats dude [:heart:1] 
2017-10-19 16:33:19	mrgray4	Yes, want an internship? 
2017-10-19 16:40:12	carl	:raising_hand: 
2017-10-19 16:43:26	mrgray4	Apply! For anyone interested, they really look positively on people who've done projects, ESPECIALLY mobile applications 
2017-11-29 10:13:26	jesse	Hey guys, one of my buddys might be getting a D in ethics and we were wondering if he would need to retake the course or not. Does anyone know? 
2017-11-29 10:17:08	carl	I don't think it's a prerequisite for anything, so I doubt it's C-walled.  
2017-11-29 10:20:43	jesse	true, but I thought there mightve been a rule about all CSC courses need to be C- or better... idk know and idk if it applies to 1 credit hour courses. 
2017-11-29 11:02:06	chrisaben	It's not c wall, I got a D- and it's checked off 
2017-11-29 11:14:40	jesse	nice. ill let my friend know. thanks. 
2017-12-21 21:38:59	carl	What is the general tech stack being used in Software Engineering these days? Would it be worth it to read up on some entry-level documentation for anything beforehand? 
2017-12-21 21:40:53	jesse	Java, and AngularJS are the big ones. The rest you can learn as you go. Selenium would help too. 
2017-12-21 21:41:32	carl	Angular 1 or Angular 2? 
2017-12-21 21:41:38	jesse	1 
2017-12-21 21:46:26	jesse	if i were you, i would get the iTrust2 project from github and learn what angularjs and selenium does and what functions/syntax to use. 
2017-12-21 21:47:15	jesse	https://github.ncsu.edu/engr-csc326-staff/iTrust-v23
2017-12-21 21:47:15		Build software better, together
2017-12-21 21:47:15		GitHub is where people build software. More than 15 million people use GitHub to discover, fork, and contribute to over 38 million projects. 
2017-12-21 21:51:08	carl	Thanks! It seems I know exactly the wrong frontend tools for this class (React+Jest and a smattering of whatever was trendy in 2015). I've heard of Selenium and Java, though. :thinking_face: 
2017-12-21 22:06:41	jesse	i think the biggest problem i had was I didnt even know what angular did or what selenium did. Nobody told us what any of that means and they threw in a bunch of fancy terms like Spring, and Hibernate as if they were relevant. 
2017-12-21 22:06:41		If you know that Angular is a tool to link up the HTML view with javascript variables, and you know how to make get and post requests (and what those mean), youll be fine.
2017-12-21 22:06:41		Selenium is for automated testing using a headless browser. sometimes it works, sometimes it doesnt. if it doesnt work, make your program wait for a few seconds after fetching a new page and try again.
2017-12-21 22:06:41		As for hibernate and spring, simple copy and paste of code elsewhere in itrust will do everything you could possibly ever want.  (edited)
2017-12-21 22:17:52	carl	I've never even heard of Spring or Hibernate. Thanks! 
2018-01-03 09:45:33	jkayani	Spring's just the Java framework they use for organizing the back end 
2018-01-03 09:46:03	jkayani	And Hibernate's an ORM (Object Relational Mapping? idk) that turns DB entities into Java objects (and vice versa) for easy manipulation in your backend [:+1::skin-tone-2:1] 
2018-01-03 09:47:06	jkayani	Honestly, it's not too difficult, and the tasks they have you do are pretty simple for the most part. If you know React, and you certainly know Java, you'll be fine imo [:+1:1] 
2018-01-03 09:48:21	jkayani	But yeah they could've done a better job explaining some of this in the course - wait until you get to Selenium and Cucumber, that's where I was confused for a while 
2018-01-03 09:51:52	jesse	yeah. they had webpages to explain those tools, but they would just explain that 
2018-01-03 09:51:52		hibernate --> object relational mapping
2018-01-03 09:51:52		its difficult for a newbie such as myself to understand what that means. at least, thats what annoyed me with coffeemaker 
2018-01-03 09:53:14	carl	"we made this hard so you'll never get to experience good software engineering" 
2018-01-03 09:53:51	jesse	xD what's good software engineering? 
2018-01-04 12:54:46	mrgray4	An oxymoron 
2018-01-04 12:55:15	mrgray4	We made it to another semester (I reset my computer pre-break and forgot to reinstall slack) 
2018-01-04 12:55:17	mrgray4	! 
2018-01-04 12:56:53	jesse	welcome back [:heart:1] 
2018-01-07 15:16:51	jkayani	What's the new Slack name going to be? Since most of us are done w. the required classes now 
2018-01-07 15:17:17	mrgray4	I was thinking about this the other day, but Heckman is still somewhat relevant to everyone, so I didn't change it yet 
2018-01-07 15:17:17	jkayani	save for senior design 
2018-01-07 15:17:21	mrgray4	Gladly taking ideas 
2018-01-07 15:17:32	mrgray4	I think @nmcroutw is the only senior designer this semester AFAIK 
2018-01-07 15:21:35	carl	When is everyone else taking senior design? 
2018-01-07 15:22:20	jkayani	Fall 2018 
2018-01-07 15:22:28	jkayani	tenatively 
2018-01-07 15:22:41	mrgray4	Same, not too tentatively because that's gradgitation time I think 
2018-01-07 15:23:03	jkayani	Yeah I'm on track to be done then, but in case this semester goes down the gutter 
2018-01-07 15:55:21	jesse	same. But I dont get the luxury of a gutter. :) 
2018-01-07 16:11:18	carl	Neat. I'm planning on taking it Spring 2019. Are y'all graduating in the Fall? [:fallen_leaf:1] 
2018-01-07 16:59:00	jesse	yeah. usually you have to take senior design last semester. 
2018-01-08 15:10:37	mrgray4	hypothetical, if you have a syllabus on git and you find a typo do you submit a PR 
2018-01-08 15:10:46	mrgray4	:thinking_face: 
2018-01-08 15:31:30	jesse	please tell me this happened to ya 
2018-01-08 15:31:59	mrgray4	I've thought about submitting the PR but I don't want to because it's just ". he" instead of ". the" 
2018-01-08 15:32:46	jesse	do it. for no other reason than you can xD 
2018-01-08 15:47:13	nmcroutw	That would be a pretty savage fdoc move

2018-03-14 11:26:01	mrgray4	What is everyone taking next semester? I was looking at CSC440, but the rate my professor reviews are some of the worst I've seen :! 
2018-03-14 11:48:06	jkayani	Yeah we were all thinking 440 but alas, it's not Chirkova teaching it 
2018-03-14 11:56:58	mrgray4	She is teaching 442 though, what about that? 
2018-03-14 11:57:05	mrgray4	I'm also looking at compiler theory, a 495 
2018-03-14 13:51:27	jkayani	What's 442? 
2018-03-14 14:27:01	jesse	i was kinda hoping I could only take 495  csc electives haha. but other than software security, ill be in human computer interaction if i can get in. 
2018-03-14 14:27:26	jesse	dunno what 442 is though. 
2018-03-14 14:33:01	jesse	i also plan on taking senior design and 2 psy courses: ergonomics and whatever psy 307 is... 
2018-03-14 14:45:22	mrgray4	I think 442 is data science 
2018-03-14 14:45:29	mrgray4	It looks like a slight continuation of data structures 
2018-03-14 14:45:51	mrgray4	jeez louise jesse 
2018-03-14 14:48:29	jesse	i know, ergonomics sounds horrible. 
2018-03-16 14:38:10		getting channel history...
2017-09-26 12:58:59	jkayani	And you can always get a spot because everyone drops lol 
2017-09-26 15:00:26	carl	I really want to take CSC555   (edited)
2017-09-26 15:00:32	mrgray4	What's that? 
2017-09-26 15:00:42	carl	Social computing 
2017-09-26 15:01:02	mrgray4	Can you copy/paste the course desc? 
2017-09-26 15:01:05	mrgray4	If it's available 
2017-09-26 15:02:30	carl	A survey of the field of social computing, introducing its key concepts, paradigms, and techniques. Specific topics will be selected from the following list: social media, social network analysis, typology of social relationships, mobility and social context, human computation, crowdsourcing, prediction markets, organizational modeling, contracts, social norms, sociotechnical systems, social interpretation of information, formal argumentation, software engineering for social computing. 
2017-09-26 15:04:41	carl	Dr. Singh teaches it in the fall.  
2017-09-26 16:33:46	jkayani	Sounds great for you [:+1:1] 
2017-09-27 00:52:52	mrgray4	Just a fun factsie, I talked to two people who are in Singh's web services class right now, and they both said it is by far one of the worst comp sci classes they've taken? 
2017-09-27 00:53:23	mrgray4	That does sound interesting though Carl, especially relevant for you like Josh said 
2017-09-27 21:35:01	carl	Oh no that's not good!
2017-09-27 21:35:01		BTW courses come out October 11.  [:goshjosh:1] 
2017-10-03 09:16:25	jesse	would anyone like to study software engineering with me?  I think if I study alone, I'll end up cycling between tweaking my computer, staring at a wall, and cleaning my apartment. 
2017-10-03 10:49:23	jesse	Galen and I are meeting up at my apartment at around 5:30/6ish if anyone else wants to join 
2017-10-09 09:11:22	carl	Special topics for next semester: https://www.csc.ncsu.edu/courses/special_topics/

2017-10-10 13:25:45	jesse	on the student page on the button  
2017-10-10 13:26:01	jesse	planning and enrollment 
2017-10-10 13:26:44	jkayani	Oh ok it just wasn't marked lol, literally just said the date 
2017-10-10 13:27:36	jesse	mine says 1:00pm 10/26/2017 Enroll Apt:
2017-10-10 13:27:36		so its sorta labeled...

2017-10-10 13:30:19	jkayani	Ooh no I haven't 
2017-10-10 13:30:24	jkayani	Good call 
2017-10-10 13:30:35	nmcroutw	It says October 20 @jkayani  
2017-10-10 13:31:16	chrisaben	^oh Yea, she's right :joy: 
2017-10-10 13:31:30	jkayani	No no I see that, I'm just saying the date has no label 
2017-10-10 13:31:56	jkayani	Like it doesn't say what that date is, it's literally just there so I have to infer thats what it means 
2017-10-10 13:32:08	chrisaben	Oh gotchu 
2017-10-10 13:32:43	jkayani	Silly MyPack 
2017-10-11 09:20:06	carl	I'm going to need to bribe whoever schedules software engineering 
2017-10-11 09:33:44	mrgray4	Hahaha why do you say that 
2017-10-11 09:34:05	mrgray4	Also who's hopping on that ethics train next semester? 
2017-10-11 09:34:27	carl	They scheduled it at the same time as a class I have to take with only one section offered. Again... [:confused:2 :cry:1] 
2017-10-11 09:34:31	jkayani	Ugh I have to do a reflection for that class and I didn't even go last time [:pensive:1] 
2017-10-11 09:34:59	mrgray4	You could do SE and Senior Design back to back semesters senior year 
2017-10-11 09:36:08	adyfrancis	Ethics: the only one credit hour class that's a bigger pain in the ass than my 3 credit hour classes [:+1:3] 
2017-10-11 09:36:30	mrgray4	Thanks for getting me excited :smile: 
2017-10-11 09:37:04	adyfrancis	I'm slight exaggerating but it is annoying  
2017-10-11 09:37:26	adyfrancis	Anyone have prof recommendations for Software Engineering? 
2017-10-11 09:39:17	chrisaben	I got a D- in that class because the teacher is the worst 
2017-10-11 09:39:43	adyfrancis	Shit there's only one professor  
2017-10-11 09:43:22	jkayani	A D- in ethics or SE @chrisaben ? 
2017-10-11 09:43:55	jkayani	SE with Heckman is good; although tbh your instructor doesn't seem to matter as much as your TAs 
2017-10-11 09:54:24	chrisaben	Ethics :joy: haven't taken SE yet 
2017-10-11 10:27:34	carl	Last semester, they changed the time for SE. Maybe they'll do it again.  
2017-10-11 10:28:50	adyfrancis	Is it MWThu this semester?  
2017-10-11 10:30:30	carl	Yes 
2017-10-11 10:32:03	nmcroutw	CSC 495 (007) had 80% A's. Sign me up 
2017-10-11 10:33:55	chrisaben	What 495 though? 
2017-10-11 10:34:39	adyfrancis	Visual interfaces for mobile devices  
2017-10-11 10:34:59	adyfrancis	Only 30 seats though  
2017-10-11 10:35:01	carl	I need to have two CSC electives completed to do senior design, so I'm not sure if pushing it back is a good idea.  
2017-10-11 11:19:20	carl	@carl uploaded a file: https://sturgill-operators.slack.com/files/U3V2J18QG/F7GPVBJDA/image.png (image.png) and commented: r8 my schedule 
2017-10-11 11:21:54	mrgray4	5/7 
2017-10-11 11:22:09	mrgray4	Your afternoons look so nice and free! 
2017-10-11 11:22:52	carl	That's the way I like it. I have class ending at 4:15 every day (M-Th) this semester and I'm not a fan. 
2017-10-11 11:27:49	carl	How many hours a week do y'all spend on CSC 326? 
2017-10-11 11:30:34	jesse	how many hours are in a week? 
2017-10-11 11:31:00	jkayani	Most of them 
2017-10-11 11:32:17	jesse	i would say i spent 40 to 50 each week on the last project. 
2017-10-11 11:32:25	carl	What is wrong this with class? :weary: 
2017-10-11 11:32:33	adyfrancis	Wtf 
2017-10-11 11:35:06	jesse	yeah. what I do, is get all my work for the other classes on one weekend day and then devote almost all my other time to software engineering. 
2017-10-11 11:35:50	carl	Someone should lead a strike. :thinking_face: 
2017-10-11 11:36:07	adyfrancis	Unionize the CSC class?? [:point_up:3] 
2017-10-11 11:38:39	carl	>  This course is based on reality, so the project will be as real-world as we can make it.... which might just mean that some aspects of the project may intentionally cause you some heartache (such as ill-defined AND/OR changing requirements). Remember, it's for your own good.
2017-10-11 11:38:39		Yeah, because every CSC grad is going to become a software engineer in industry... 
2017-10-11 11:42:24	chrisaben	I love how that is the course description though :joy: 
2017-10-11 11:46:34	adyfrancis	Is it that the projects are difficult to code? Or is it just a lot of components  
2017-10-11 11:48:01	chrisaben	I think it's just that the companies that assign them give really shitty requirements, unlike what we've been assigned in our other programming classes, and then they'll be like OH YEA WE'RE GONNA GO WITH THIS SHIT INSTEAD when you already spent several hours creating the component they originally wanted 
2017-10-11 11:49:04	mrgray4	@adyfrancis some bugs are difficult to find, but it's just a big ol pile of shit 
2017-10-11 11:49:06	mrgray4	as in a lot 
2017-10-11 11:49:22	jkayani	Delegating tasks and making sure everyone is in sync is the real challenge imo [:point_up:1] 
2017-10-11 11:49:23	carl	> the companies that assign them
2017-10-11 11:49:23		What does this mean? 
2017-10-11 11:49:37	jkayani	Especially when your team members are at different skill levels 
2017-10-11 11:50:04	jkayani	I had to hold my teammates hand the last 2 projects and it's exhausting 
2017-10-11 11:50:19	chrisaben	I heard that the projects are like company assignments? I may be thinking about senior design 
2017-10-11 11:50:37	chrisaben	Someone was describing the one of the classes in this way 
2017-10-11 11:50:48	mrgray4	Yep that's senior design 
2017-10-11 11:50:48	jkayani	Nah 326 you're multiple groups working on the same project to do the same things [:point_up:1] 
2017-10-11 11:51:06	jkayani	But it's separate code base per group 
2017-10-11 11:51:31	jkayani	So each group has an iTryst, and each group works too add the same bullshit to it 
2017-10-11 12:04:32	carl	Thinking from the perspective of The Communicative Constitution of Organization, it sounds like CSC 326 does almost everything wrong when it comes to the flow of communication. As the class seems to force organizational flexibility, I would assume that most groups never achieve an effective process of "organizational self-structuring" where they formalize their communication roles and methods. The class bypasses the "membership negotiation" communication flow by assigning random groups, which likely destroys the homogeneity of groups' goals and values. This makes it hard to define clear expectations for group members. Furthermore, this makes it even more difficult to be effective in the communication flow of "activity coordination" because members have little way of knowing the abilities and preferences of other group members. I would assume that there are also problems in "institutional positioning" because group assignments typically have one point of contact between the organization (the student group) and their publics (the teaching staff). This makes it challenging for the teaching staff to address imbalances in power and passion which is likely the driving force for decision-making in these groups. 
2017-10-11 12:05:00	carl	tl;dr not looking forward to this class at all 
2017-10-11 12:06:19	jkayani	You do get to pick your groups on the last, biggest project 
2017-10-11 12:06:42	carl	Based on this, the notion that the course is in any way reflective of the "real world" is folly because the communicative constitution of the student groups is fundamentally different from the communicative constitution of professional software development teams.  (edited)
2017-10-11 12:07:31	jkayani	And yeah there is 1 point of contact, but he's like a God in that he almost always has a solution and dedicates his life to this class [:point_up:1] 
2017-10-11 17:27:17	nmcroutw	Are any of you interning/working part time along with school? If so how many hours? I'm trying to decide if working 20 hours would be too much with classes 
2017-10-11 17:28:41	jesse	not me.  
2017-10-11 17:29:08	jkayani	I wouldn't do it 
2017-10-11 17:29:20	jkayani	For me anyway, with 326, hell no 
2017-10-11 17:29:24	carl	I'm working a few jobs currently. 20 hours definitely sounds like too much.  
2017-10-11 19:53:06	mrgray4	I like school and classes separate. Got offered for channeladvisor but turned it down for that reason. If you can go part time then maybe consider that if you?re not getting financial aid. Personally I?d say no 
2017-10-11 19:53:59	jesse	what is school without classes? :) 
2017-10-11 19:56:49	mbbennis	I'm doing 20 hours now, but I'm only in 11 hours of classes. I usually end up clocking a few hours under and I'm somehow less busy now than I have been in some full time semesters 
2017-10-11 19:57:06	mbbennis	But idk, it probably depends on the job 
2017-10-12 09:41:40	mrgray4	@mrgray4 uploaded a file: https://sturgill-operators.slack.com/files/U3WBH0F7G/F7GPV4MEV/screen_shot_2017-10-12_at_9.40.42_am.png (Screen Shot 2017-10-12 at 9.40.42 AM.png) and commented: Schedule ?\_(?)_/? . This will leave me with a CSC elective, a math elective, an other elective, and senior design (also a 100 fit level)

2017-10-12 10:21:44	jesse	theres ours... but most of it is the same. 
2017-10-12 10:29:33	jesse	was the 'types of problems' what kowolenko talked about during the review day? 
2017-10-12 10:30:00	jesse	i was there but I didnt take notes on that. 
2017-10-12 10:30:07	adyfrancis	It was a part of the paper 
2017-10-12 10:30:38	adyfrancis	According to friends of my group mates who have taken the class before he asked "name 5 problems and give examples of each" 
2017-10-12 10:31:55	jesse	i dont recall us getting any paper. but I'll try to remember the ones in your sheet 
2017-10-12 10:32:22	adyfrancis	We were told to read a paper about types of problems  
2017-10-12 10:32:55	jesse	oh yeahhhh...  those readings  
2017-10-12 10:33:50	jesse	i didn't read them so that explains why it looked new 
2017-10-12 11:15:16	mrgray4	Hey I read that thing! I did a thing for once! [:+1::skin-tone-3:1] 
2017-10-16 10:03:53	nmcroutw	Is anyone in 401? How is it? 
2017-10-16 10:38:31	jkayani	Yeah 
2017-10-16 10:38:44	jkayani	It's alright - it can be a bit dry at times, b/c it's a lot of digging into protcols 
2017-10-17 10:11:19	adyfrancis	495 pals what are we supposed to talk about today? Something about data? 
2017-10-17 10:18:17	nmcroutw	We are presenting our databases. I wrote down we need to talk about schema, primary keys, and address formatting issues but idk exactly what all those are 
2017-10-17 10:19:03	adyfrancis	Yeah I wrote where I sourced data and primary keys for structured data but I was forgetting about the schema for unstructured  
2017-10-17 10:19:06	adyfrancis	Thanks! 
2017-10-19 15:37:21	mrgray4	Folks, I got the WillowTree internship!!! [:smile:3] 
2017-10-19 15:37:49	mrgray4	My recruiter had resigned leaving me in internship limbo, but I got through today and found out I have an offer :D 
2017-10-19 16:22:56	jesse	was the internship for a position as a recruiter? xD [:goshjosh:1] 
2017-10-19 16:23:07	jesse	congrats dude [:heart:1] 
2017-10-19 16:33:19	mrgray4	Yes, want an internship? 
2017-10-19 16:40:12	carl	:raising_hand: 
2017-10-19 16:43:26	mrgray4	Apply! For anyone interested, they really look positively on people who've done projects, ESPECIALLY mobile applications 
2017-11-29 10:13:26	jesse	Hey guys, one of my buddys might be getting a D in ethics and we were wondering if he would need to retake the course or not. Does anyone know? 
2017-11-29 10:17:08	carl	I don't think it's a prerequisite for anything, so I doubt it's C-walled.  
2017-11-29 10:20:43	jesse	true, but I thought there mightve been a rule about all CSC courses need to be C- or better... idk know and idk if it applies to 1 credit hour courses. 
2017-11-29 11:02:06	chrisaben	It's not c wall, I got a D- and it's checked off 
2017-11-29 11:14:40	jesse	nice. ill let my friend know. thanks. 
2017-12-21 21:38:59	carl	What is the general tech stack being used in Software Engineering these days? Would it be worth it to read up on some entry-level documentation for anything beforehand? 
2017-12-21 21:40:53	jesse	Java, and AngularJS are the big ones. The rest you can learn as you go. Selenium would help too. 
2017-12-21 21:41:32	carl	Angular 1 or Angular 2? 
2017-12-21 21:41:38	jesse	1 
2017-12-21 21:46:26	jesse	if i were you, i would get the iTrust2 project from github and learn what angularjs and selenium does and what functions/syntax to use. 
2017-12-21 21:47:15	jesse	https://github.ncsu.edu/engr-csc326-staff/iTrust-v23
2017-12-21 21:47:15		Build software better, together
2017-12-21 21:47:15		GitHub is where people build software. More than 15 million people use GitHub to discover, fork, and contribute to over 38 million projects. 
2017-12-21 21:51:08	carl	Thanks! It seems I know exactly the wrong frontend tools for this class (React+Jest and a smattering of whatever was trendy in 2015). I've heard of Selenium and Java, though. :thinking_face: 
2017-12-21 22:06:41	jesse	i think the biggest problem i had was I didnt even know what angular did or what selenium did. Nobody told us what any of that means and they threw in a bunch of fancy terms like Spring, and Hibernate as if they were relevant. 
2017-12-21 22:06:41		If you know that Angular is a tool to link up the HTML view with javascript variables, and you know how to make get and post requests (and what those mean), youll be fine.
2017-12-21 22:06:41		Selenium is for automated testing using a headless browser. sometimes it works, sometimes it doesnt. if it doesnt work, make your program wait for a few seconds after fetching a new page and try again.
2017-12-21 22:06:41		As for hibernate and spring, simple copy and paste of code elsewhere in itrust will do everything you could possibly ever want.  (edited)
2017-12-21 22:17:52	carl	I've never even heard of Spring or Hibernate. Thanks! 
2018-01-03 09:45:33	jkayani	Spring's just the Java framework they use for organizing the back end 
2018-01-03 09:46:03	jkayani	And Hibernate's an ORM (Object Relational Mapping? idk) that turns DB entities into Java objects (and vice versa) for easy manipulation in your backend [:+1::skin-tone-2:1] 
2018-01-03 09:47:06	jkayani	Honestly, it's not too difficult, and the tasks they have you do are pretty simple for the most part. If you know React, and you certainly know Java, you'll be fine imo [:+1:1] 
2018-01-03 09:48:21	jkayani	But yeah they could've done a better job explaining some of this in the course - wait until you get to Selenium and Cucumber, that's where I was confused for a while 
2018-01-03 09:51:52	jesse	yeah. they had webpages to explain those tools, but they would just explain that 
2018-01-03 09:51:52		hibernate --> object relational mapping
2018-01-03 09:51:52		its difficult for a newbie such as myself to understand what that means. at least, thats what annoyed me with coffeemaker 
2018-01-03 09:53:14	carl	"we made this hard so you'll never get to experience good software engineering" 
2018-01-03 09:53:51	jesse	xD what's good software engineering? 
2018-01-04 12:54:46	mrgray4	An oxymoron 
2018-01-04 12:55:15	mrgray4	We made it to another semester (I reset my computer pre-break and forgot to reinstall slack) 
2018-01-04 12:55:17	mrgray4	! 
2018-01-04 12:56:53	jesse	welcome back [:heart:1] 
2018-01-07 15:16:51	jkayani	What's the new Slack name going to be? Since most of us are done w. the required classes now 
2018-01-07 15:17:17	mrgray4	I was thinking about this the other day, but Heckman is still somewhat relevant to everyone, so I didn't change it yet 
2018-01-07 15:17:17	jkayani	save for senior design 
2018-01-07 15:17:21	mrgray4	Gladly taking ideas 
2018-01-07 15:17:32	mrgray4	I think @nmcroutw is the only senior designer this semester AFAIK 
2018-01-07 15:21:35	carl	When is everyone else taking senior design? 
2018-01-07 15:22:20	jkayani	Fall 2018 
2018-01-07 15:22:28	jkayani	tenatively 
2018-01-07 15:22:41	mrgray4	Same, not too tentatively because that's gradgitation time I think 
2018-01-07 15:23:03	jkayani	Yeah I'm on track to be done then, but in case this semester goes down the gutter 
2018-01-07 15:55:21	jesse	same. But I dont get the luxury of a gutter. :) 
2018-01-07 16:11:18	carl	Neat. I'm planning on taking it Spring 2019. Are y'all graduating in the Fall? [:fallen_leaf:1] 
2018-01-07 16:59:00	jesse	yeah. usually you have to take senior design last semester. 
2018-01-08 15:10:37	mrgray4	hypothetical, if you have a syllabus on git and you find a typo do you submit a PR 
2018-01-08 15:10:46	mrgray4	:thinking_face: 
2018-01-08 15:31:30	jesse	please tell me this happened to ya 
2018-01-08 15:31:59	mrgray4	I've thought about submitting the PR but I don't want to because it's just ". he" instead of ". the" 
2018-01-08 15:32:46	jesse	do it. for no other reason than you can xD 
2018-01-08 15:47:13	nmcroutw	That would be a pretty savage fdoc move

2018-03-14 11:26:01	mrgray4	What is everyone taking next semester? I was looking at CSC440, but the rate my professor reviews are some of the worst I've seen :! 
2018-03-14 11:48:06	jkayani	Yeah we were all thinking 440 but alas, it's not Chirkova teaching it 
2018-03-14 11:56:58	mrgray4	She is teaching 442 though, what about that? 
2018-03-14 11:57:05	mrgray4	I'm also looking at compiler theory, a 495 
2018-03-14 13:51:27	jkayani	What's 442? 
2018-03-14 14:27:01	jesse	i was kinda hoping I could only take 495  csc electives haha. but other than software security, ill be in human computer interaction if i can get in. 
2018-03-14 14:27:26	jesse	dunno what 442 is though. 
2018-03-14 14:33:01	jesse	i also plan on taking senior design and 2 psy courses: ergonomics and whatever psy 307 is... 
2018-03-14 14:45:22	mrgray4	I think 442 is data science 
2018-03-14 14:45:29	mrgray4	It looks like a slight continuation of data structures 
2018-03-14 14:45:51	mrgray4	jeez louise jesse 
2018-03-14 14:48:29	jesse	i know, ergonomics sounds horrible. 
2018-03-21 14:20:11		getting channel history...
2017-09-27 21:35:01	carl	Oh no that's not good!
2017-09-27 21:35:01		BTW courses come out October 11.  [:goshjosh:1] 
2017-10-03 09:16:25	jesse	would anyone like to study software engineering with me?  I think if I study alone, I'll end up cycling between tweaking my computer, staring at a wall, and cleaning my apartment. 
2017-10-03 10:49:23	jesse	Galen and I are meeting up at my apartment at around 5:30/6ish if anyone else wants to join 
2017-10-09 09:11:22	carl	Special topics for next semester: https://www.csc.ncsu.edu/courses/special_topics/
2017-10-09 09:11:22		Department of Computer Science at North Carolina State University
2017-10-09 09:11:22		Department of Computer Science at NC State University 
2017-10-10 12:38:40	mrgray4	Okay 002 sounds so cool 
2017-10-10 12:38:47	mrgray4	Doing the same program in 4 very different languages 
2017-10-10 12:38:50	mrgray4	Count me in 
2017-10-10 12:39:27	mrgray4	Also 007 
2017-10-10 12:43:17	nmcroutw	007 does look neat  
2017-10-10 13:25:07	jkayani	Where can you find your registration date on the new mypack?  (edited)
2017-10-10 13:25:45	jesse	on the student page on the button  
2017-10-10 13:26:01	jesse	planning and enrollment 
2017-10-10 13:26:44	jkayani	Oh ok it just wasn't marked lol, literally just said the date 
2017-10-10 13:27:36	jesse	mine says 1:00pm 10/26/2017 Enroll Apt:
2017-10-10 13:27:36		so its sorta labeled...  
2017-10-10 13:29:19	jkayani	@jkayani uploaded a file: https://sturgill-operators.slack.com/files/U3VP4JQPL/F7GA0KDU5/screenshot_20171010-132857.png (Screenshot_20171010-132857.png) and commented: No label at all haha

2017-10-10 13:30:19	jkayani	Ooh no I haven't 
2017-10-10 13:30:24	jkayani	Good call 
2017-10-10 13:30:35	nmcroutw	It says October 20 @jkayani  
2017-10-10 13:31:16	chrisaben	^oh Yea, she's right :joy: 
2017-10-10 13:31:30	jkayani	No no I see that, I'm just saying the date has no label 
2017-10-10 13:31:56	jkayani	Like it doesn't say what that date is, it's literally just there so I have to infer thats what it means 
2017-10-10 13:32:08	chrisaben	Oh gotchu 
2017-10-10 13:32:43	jkayani	Silly MyPack 
2017-10-11 09:20:06	carl	I'm going to need to bribe whoever schedules software engineering 
2017-10-11 09:33:44	mrgray4	Hahaha why do you say that 
2017-10-11 09:34:05	mrgray4	Also who's hopping on that ethics train next semester? 
2017-10-11 09:34:27	carl	They scheduled it at the same time as a class I have to take with only one section offered. Again... [:confused:2 :cry:1] 
2017-10-11 09:34:31	jkayani	Ugh I have to do a reflection for that class and I didn't even go last time [:pensive:1] 
2017-10-11 09:34:59	mrgray4	You could do SE and Senior Design back to back semesters senior year 
2017-10-11 09:36:08	adyfrancis	Ethics: the only one credit hour class that's a bigger pain in the ass than my 3 credit hour classes [:+1:3] 
2017-10-11 09:36:30	mrgray4	Thanks for getting me excited :smile: 
2017-10-11 09:37:04	adyfrancis	I'm slight exaggerating but it is annoying  
2017-10-11 09:37:26	adyfrancis	Anyone have prof recommendations for Software Engineering? 
2017-10-11 09:39:17	chrisaben	I got a D- in that class because the teacher is the worst 
2017-10-11 09:39:43	adyfrancis	Shit there's only one professor  
2017-10-11 09:43:22	jkayani	A D- in ethics or SE @chrisaben ? 
2017-10-11 09:43:55	jkayani	SE with Heckman is good; although tbh your instructor doesn't seem to matter as much as your TAs 
2017-10-11 09:54:24	chrisaben	Ethics :joy: haven't taken SE yet 
2017-10-11 10:27:34	carl	Last semester, they changed the time for SE. Maybe they'll do it again.  
2017-10-11 10:28:50	adyfrancis	Is it MWThu this semester?  
2017-10-11 10:30:30	carl	Yes 
2017-10-11 10:32:03	nmcroutw	CSC 495 (007) had 80% A's. Sign me up 
2017-10-11 10:33:55	chrisaben	What 495 though? 
2017-10-11 10:34:39	adyfrancis	Visual interfaces for mobile devices  
2017-10-11 10:34:59	adyfrancis	Only 30 seats though  
2017-10-11 10:35:01	carl	I need to have two CSC electives completed to do senior design, so I'm not sure if pushing it back is a good idea.  
2017-10-11 11:19:20	carl	@carl uploaded a file: https://sturgill-operators.slack.com/files/U3V2J18QG/F7GPVBJDA/image.png (image.png) and commented: r8 my schedule

2017-10-11 11:22:09	mrgray4	Your afternoons look so nice and free! 
2017-10-11 11:22:52	carl	That's the way I like it. I have class ending at 4:15 every day (M-Th) this semester and I'm not a fan. 
2017-10-11 11:27:49	carl	How many hours a week do y'all spend on CSC 326? 
2017-10-11 11:30:34	jesse	how many hours are in a week? 
2017-10-11 11:31:00	jkayani	Most of them 
2017-10-11 11:32:17	jesse	i would say i spent 40 to 50 each week on the last project. 
2017-10-11 11:32:25	carl	What is wrong this with class? :weary: 
2017-10-11 11:32:33	adyfrancis	Wtf 
2017-10-11 11:35:06	jesse	yeah. what I do, is get all my work for the other classes on one weekend day and then devote almost all my other time to software engineering. 
2017-10-11 11:35:50	carl	Someone should lead a strike. :thinking_face: 
2017-10-11 11:36:07	adyfrancis	Unionize the CSC class?? [:point_up:3] 
2017-10-11 11:38:39	carl	>  This course is based on reality, so the project will be as real-world as we can make it.... which might just mean that some aspects of the project may intentionally cause you some heartache (such as ill-defined AND/OR changing requirements). Remember, it's for your own good.
2017-10-11 11:38:39		Yeah, because every CSC grad is going to become a software engineer in industry... 
2017-10-11 11:42:24	chrisaben	I love how that is the course description though :joy: 
2017-10-11 11:46:34	adyfrancis	Is it that the projects are difficult to code? Or is it just a lot of components  
2017-10-11 11:48:01	chrisaben	I think it's just that the companies that assign them give really shitty requirements, unlike what we've been assigned in our other programming classes, and then they'll be like OH YEA WE'RE GONNA GO WITH THIS SHIT INSTEAD when you already spent several hours creating the component they originally wanted 
2017-10-11 11:49:04	mrgray4	@adyfrancis some bugs are difficult to find, but it's just a big ol pile of shit 
2017-10-11 11:49:06	mrgray4	as in a lot 
2017-10-11 11:49:22	jkayani	Delegating tasks and making sure everyone is in sync is the real challenge imo [:point_up:1] 
2017-10-11 11:49:23	carl	> the companies that assign them
2017-10-11 11:49:23		What does this mean? 
2017-10-11 11:49:37	jkayani	Especially when your team members are at different skill levels 
2017-10-11 11:50:04	jkayani	I had to hold my teammates hand the last 2 projects and it's exhausting 
2017-10-11 11:50:19	chrisaben	I heard that the projects are like company assignments? I may be thinking about senior design 
2017-10-11 11:50:37	chrisaben	Someone was describing the one of the classes in this way 
2017-10-11 11:50:48	mrgray4	Yep that's senior design 
2017-10-11 11:50:48	jkayani	Nah 326 you're multiple groups working on the same project to do the same things [:point_up:1] 
2017-10-11 11:51:06	jkayani	But it's separate code base per group 
2017-10-11 11:51:31	jkayani	So each group has an iTryst, and each group works too add the same bullshit to it 
2017-10-11 12:04:32	carl	Thinking from the perspective of The Communicative Constitution of Organization, it sounds like CSC 326 does almost everything wrong when it comes to the flow of communication. As the class seems to force organizational flexibility, I would assume that most groups never achieve an effective process of "organizational self-structuring" where they formalize their communication roles and methods. The class bypasses the "membership negotiation" communication flow by assigning random groups, which likely destroys the homogeneity of groups' goals and values. This makes it hard to define clear expectations for group members. Furthermore, this makes it even more difficult to be effective in the communication flow of "activity coordination" because members have little way of knowing the abilities and preferences of other group members. I would assume that there are also problems in "institutional positioning" because group assignments typically have one point of contact between the organization (the student group) and their publics (the teaching staff). This makes it challenging for the teaching staff to address imbalances in power and passion which is likely the driving force for decision-making in these groups. 
2017-10-11 12:05:00	carl	tl;dr not looking forward to this class at all 
2017-10-11 12:06:19	jkayani	You do get to pick your groups on the last, biggest project 
2017-10-11 12:06:42	carl	Based on this, the notion that the course is in any way reflective of the "real world" is folly because the communicative constitution of the student groups is fundamentally different from the communicative constitution of professional software development teams.  (edited)
2017-10-11 12:07:31	jkayani	And yeah there is 1 point of contact, but he's like a God in that he almost always has a solution and dedicates his life to this class [:point_up:1] 
2017-10-11 17:27:17	nmcroutw	Are any of you interning/working part time along with school? If so how many hours? I'm trying to decide if working 20 hours would be too much with classes 
2017-10-11 17:28:41	jesse	not me.  
2017-10-11 17:29:08	jkayani	I wouldn't do it 
2017-10-11 17:29:20	jkayani	For me anyway, with 326, hell no 
2017-10-11 17:29:24	carl	I'm working a few jobs currently. 20 hours definitely sounds like too much.  
2017-10-11 19:53:06	mrgray4	I like school and classes separate. Got offered for channeladvisor but turned it down for that reason. If you can go part time then maybe consider that if you?re not getting financial aid. Personally I?d say no 
2017-10-11 19:53:59	jesse	what is school without classes? :) 
2017-10-11 19:56:49	mbbennis	I'm doing 20 hours now, but I'm only in 11 hours of classes. I usually end up clocking a few hours under and I'm somehow less busy now than I have been in some full time semesters 
2017-10-11 19:57:06	mbbennis	But idk, it probably depends on the job 
2017-10-12 09:41:40	mrgray4	@mrgray4 uploaded a file: https://sturgill-operators.slack.com/files/U3WBH0F7G/F7GPV4MEV/screen_shot_2017-10-12_at_9.40.42_am.png (Screen Shot 2017-10-12 at 9.40.42 AM.png) and commented: Schedule ?\_(?)_/? . This will leave me with a CSC elective, a math elective, an other elective, and senior design (also a 100 fit level) 
2017-10-12 10:17:44	adyfrancis	To all my 495 homies https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TJmMcs4hGlp1lbd2BhCpUEZJBTnnhW5PdTZn0KHvSlc/edit 
2017-10-12 10:17:58	adyfrancis	Study guide  [:heart_eyes:1] 
2017-10-12 10:18:32	adyfrancis	P sure that's everything he can ask us  
2017-10-12 10:21:31	jesse	https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zEXElVJmPOV43AYAhHemp-UzrxOMfh2khvpZM4VallA/edit?usp=drivesdk 
2017-10-12 10:21:44	jesse	theres ours... but most of it is the same. 
2017-10-12 10:29:33	jesse	was the 'types of problems' what kowolenko talked about during the review day? 
2017-10-12 10:30:00	jesse	i was there but I didnt take notes on that. 
2017-10-12 10:30:07	adyfrancis	It was a part of the paper 
2017-10-12 10:30:38	adyfrancis	According to friends of my group mates who have taken the class before he asked "name 5 problems and give examples of each" 
2017-10-12 10:31:55	jesse	i dont recall us getting any paper. but I'll try to remember the ones in your sheet 
2017-10-12 10:32:22	adyfrancis	We were told to read a paper about types of problems  
2017-10-12 10:32:55	jesse	oh yeahhhh...  those readings  
2017-10-12 10:33:50	jesse	i didn't read them so that explains why it looked new 
2017-10-12 11:15:16	mrgray4	Hey I read that thing! I did a thing for once! [:+1::skin-tone-3:1] 
2017-10-16 10:03:53	nmcroutw	Is anyone in 401? How is it? 
2017-10-16 10:38:31	jkayani	Yeah 
2017-10-16 10:38:44	jkayani	It's alright - it can be a bit dry at times, b/c it's a lot of digging into protcols 
2017-10-17 10:11:19	adyfrancis	495 pals what are we supposed to talk about today? Something about data? 
2017-10-17 10:18:17	nmcroutw	We are presenting our databases. I wrote down we need to talk about schema, primary keys, and address formatting issues but idk exactly what all those are 
2017-10-17 10:19:03	adyfrancis	Yeah I wrote where I sourced data and primary keys for structured data but I was forgetting about the schema for unstructured  
2017-10-17 10:19:06	adyfrancis	Thanks! 
2017-10-19 15:37:21	mrgray4	Folks, I got the WillowTree internship!!! [:smile:3] 
2017-10-19 15:37:49	mrgray4	My recruiter had resigned leaving me in internship limbo, but I got through today and found out I have an offer :D 
2017-10-19 16:22:56	jesse	was the internship for a position as a recruiter? xD [:goshjosh:1] 
2017-10-19 16:23:07	jesse	congrats dude [:heart:1] 
2017-10-19 16:33:19	mrgray4	Yes, want an internship? 
2017-10-19 16:40:12	carl	:raising_hand: 
2017-10-19 16:43:26	mrgray4	Apply! For anyone interested, they really look positively on people who've done projects, ESPECIALLY mobile applications 
2017-11-29 10:13:26	jesse	Hey guys, one of my buddys might be getting a D in ethics and we were wondering if he would need to retake the course or not. Does anyone know? 
2017-11-29 10:17:08	carl	I don't think it's a prerequisite for anything, so I doubt it's C-walled.  
2017-11-29 10:20:43	jesse	true, but I thought there mightve been a rule about all CSC courses need to be C- or better... idk know and idk if it applies to 1 credit hour courses. 
2017-11-29 11:02:06	chrisaben	It's not c wall, I got a D- and it's checked off 
2017-11-29 11:14:40	jesse	nice. ill let my friend know. thanks. 
2017-12-21 21:38:59	carl	What is the general tech stack being used in Software Engineering these days? Would it be worth it to read up on some entry-level documentation for anything beforehand? 
2017-12-21 21:40:53	jesse	Java, and AngularJS are the big ones. The rest you can learn as you go. Selenium would help too. 
2017-12-21 21:41:32	carl	Angular 1 or Angular 2? 
2017-12-21 21:41:38	jesse	1 
2017-12-21 21:46:26	jesse	if i were you, i would get the iTrust2 project from github and learn what angularjs and selenium does and what functions/syntax to use. 
2017-12-21 21:47:15	jesse	https://github.ncsu.edu/engr-csc326-staff/iTrust-v23
2017-12-21 21:47:15		Build software better, together
2017-12-21 21:47:15		GitHub is where people build software. More than 15 million people use GitHub to discover, fork, and contribute to over 38 million projects. 
2017-12-21 21:51:08	carl	Thanks! It seems I know exactly the wrong frontend tools for this class (React+Jest and a smattering of whatever was trendy in 2015). I've heard of Selenium and Java, though. :thinking_face: 
2017-12-21 22:06:41	jesse	i think the biggest problem i had was I didnt even know what angular did or what selenium did. Nobody told us what any of that means and they threw in a bunch of fancy terms like Spring, and Hibernate as if they were relevant. 
2017-12-21 22:06:41		If you know that Angular is a tool to link up the HTML view with javascript variables, and you know how to make get and post requests (and what those mean), youll be fine.
2017-12-21 22:06:41		Selenium is for automated testing using a headless browser. sometimes it works, sometimes it doesnt. if it doesnt work, make your program wait for a few seconds after fetching a new page and try again.
2017-12-21 22:06:41		As for hibernate and spring, simple copy and paste of code elsewhere in itrust will do everything you could possibly ever want.  (edited)
2017-12-21 22:17:52	carl	I've never even heard of Spring or Hibernate. Thanks! 
2018-01-03 09:45:33	jkayani	Spring's just the Java framework they use for organizing the back end 
2018-01-03 09:46:03	jkayani	And Hibernate's an ORM (Object Relational Mapping? idk) that turns DB entities into Java objects (and vice versa) for easy manipulation in your backend [:+1::skin-tone-2:1] 
2018-01-03 09:47:06	jkayani	Honestly, it's not too difficult, and the tasks they have you do are pretty simple for the most part. If you know React, and you certainly know Java, you'll be fine imo [:+1:1] 
2018-01-03 09:48:21	jkayani	But yeah they could've done a better job explaining some of this in the course - wait until you get to Selenium and Cucumber, that's where I was confused for a while 
2018-01-03 09:51:52	jesse	yeah. they had webpages to explain those tools, but they would just explain that 
2018-01-03 09:51:52		hibernate --> object relational mapping
2018-01-03 09:51:52		its difficult for a newbie such as myself to understand what that means. at least, thats what annoyed me with coffeemaker 
2018-01-03 09:53:14	carl	"we made this hard so you'll never get to experience good software engineering" 
2018-01-03 09:53:51	jesse	xD what's good software engineering? 
2018-01-04 12:54:46	mrgray4	An oxymoron 
2018-01-04 12:55:15	mrgray4	We made it to another semester (I reset my computer pre-break and forgot to reinstall slack) 
2018-01-04 12:55:17	mrgray4	! 
2018-01-04 12:56:53	jesse	welcome back [:heart:1] 
2018-01-07 15:16:51	jkayani	What's the new Slack name going to be? Since most of us are done w. the required classes now 
2018-01-07 15:17:17	mrgray4	I was thinking about this the other day, but Heckman is still somewhat relevant to everyone, so I didn't change it yet 
2018-01-07 15:17:17	jkayani	save for senior design 
2018-01-07 15:17:21	mrgray4	Gladly taking ideas 
2018-01-07 15:17:32	mrgray4	I think @nmcroutw is the only senior designer this semester AFAIK 
2018-01-07 15:21:35	carl	When is everyone else taking senior design? 
2018-01-07 15:22:20	jkayani	Fall 2018 
2018-01-07 15:22:28	jkayani	tenatively 
2018-01-07 15:22:41	mrgray4	Same, not too tentatively because that's gradgitation time I think 
2018-01-07 15:23:03	jkayani	Yeah I'm on track to be done then, but in case this semester goes down the gutter 
2018-01-07 15:55:21	jesse	same. But I dont get the luxury of a gutter. :) 
2018-01-07 16:11:18	carl	Neat. I'm planning on taking it Spring 2019. Are y'all graduating in the Fall? [:fallen_leaf:1] 
2018-01-07 16:59:00	jesse	yeah. usually you have to take senior design last semester. 
2018-01-08 15:10:37	mrgray4	hypothetical, if you have a syllabus on git and you find a typo do you submit a PR 
2018-01-08 15:10:46	mrgray4	:thinking_face: 
2018-01-08 15:31:30	jesse	please tell me this happened to ya 
2018-01-08 15:31:59	mrgray4	I've thought about submitting the PR but I don't want to because it's just ". he" instead of ". the" 
2018-01-08 15:32:46	jesse	do it. for no other reason than you can xD 
2018-01-08 15:47:13	nmcroutw	That would be a pretty savage fdoc move

2018-03-14 11:26:01	mrgray4	What is everyone taking next semester? I was looking at CSC440, but the rate my professor reviews are some of the worst I've seen :! 
2018-03-14 11:48:06	jkayani	Yeah we were all thinking 440 but alas, it's not Chirkova teaching it 
2018-03-14 11:56:58	mrgray4	She is teaching 442 though, what about that? 
2018-03-14 11:57:05	mrgray4	I'm also looking at compiler theory, a 495 
2018-03-14 13:51:27	jkayani	What's 442? 
2018-03-14 14:27:01	jesse	i was kinda hoping I could only take 495  csc electives haha. but other than software security, ill be in human computer interaction if i can get in. 
2018-03-14 14:27:26	jesse	dunno what 442 is though. 
2018-03-14 14:33:01	jesse	i also plan on taking senior design and 2 psy courses: ergonomics and whatever psy 307 is... 
2018-03-14 14:45:22	mrgray4	I think 442 is data science 
2018-03-14 14:45:29	mrgray4	It looks like a slight continuation of data structures 
2018-03-14 14:45:51	mrgray4	jeez louise jesse 
2018-03-14 14:48:29	jesse	i know, ergonomics sounds horrible. 
2018-03-18 14:14:33	mrgray4	Is mypack down for anyone else? 
2018-03-18 14:14:46	mrgray4	Tried in safari and chrome, both are fubar'd 
2018-03-18 14:14:49	gjabell	yep 
2018-03-18 14:14:54	mrgray4	rip 
2018-03-18 14:14:54	gjabell	is broke 
2018-03-18 14:15:04	mrgray4	I want mypack to be a senior design project 
2018-03-18 14:16:28	gjabell	see, you say that... but can you imagine being given the current code and told to improve it xD 
2018-03-18 14:16:48	mrgray4	No, like from scratch. Given API specs. 
2018-03-18 14:16:51	mrgray4	Fuck the current code 
2018-03-18 14:17:04	mrgray4	Going from scratch would take a few semesters, but it'd have so many possibilities 
2018-03-18 14:20:37	gjabell	yeah 
2018-03-22 16:09:27	gjabell	Yep 
2018-03-22 16:07:29		getting channel history...

2017-10-10 12:38:40	mrgray4	Okay 002 sounds so cool 
2017-10-10 12:38:47	mrgray4	Doing the same program in 4 very different languages 
2017-10-10 12:38:50	mrgray4	Count me in 
2017-10-10 12:39:27	mrgray4	Also 007

2017-10-10 13:26:01	jesse	planning and enrollment 
2017-10-10 13:26:44	jkayani	Oh ok it just wasn't marked lol, literally just said the date

2017-10-10 13:30:19	jkayani	Ooh no I haven't 
2017-10-10 13:30:24	jkayani	Good call 
2017-10-10 13:30:35	nmcroutw	It says October 20 @jkayani  
2017-10-10 13:31:16	chrisaben	^oh Yea, she's right :joy: 
2017-10-10 13:31:30	jkayani	No no I see that, I'm just saying the date has no label 
2017-10-10 13:31:56	jkayani	Like it doesn't say what that date is, it's literally just there so I have to infer thats what it means 
2017-10-10 13:32:08	chrisaben	Oh gotchu 
2017-10-10 13:32:43	jkayani	Silly MyPack 
2017-10-11 09:20:06	carl	I'm going to need to bribe whoever schedules software engineering 
2017-10-11 09:33:44	mrgray4	Hahaha why do you say that 
2017-10-11 09:34:05	mrgray4	Also who's hopping on that ethics train next semester? 
2017-10-11 09:34:27	carl	They scheduled it at the same time as a class I have to take with only one section offered. Again... [:confused:2 :cry:1] 
2017-10-11 09:34:31	jkayani	Ugh I have to do a reflection for that class and I didn't even go last time [:pensive:1] 
2017-10-11 09:34:59	mrgray4	You could do SE and Senior Design back to back semesters senior year 
2017-10-11 09:36:08	adyfrancis	Ethics: the only one credit hour class that's a bigger pain in the ass than my 3 credit hour classes [:+1:3] 
2017-10-11 09:36:30	mrgray4	Thanks for getting me excited :smile: 
2017-10-11 09:37:04	adyfrancis	I'm slight exaggerating but it is annoying  
2017-10-11 09:37:26	adyfrancis	Anyone have prof recommendations for Software Engineering? 
2017-10-11 09:39:17	chrisaben	I got a D- in that class because the teacher is the worst 
2017-10-11 09:39:43	adyfrancis	Shit there's only one professor  
2017-10-11 09:43:22	jkayani	A D- in ethics or SE @chrisaben ? 
2017-10-11 09:43:55	jkayani	SE with Heckman is good; although tbh your instructor doesn't seem to matter as much as your TAs 
2017-10-11 09:54:24	chrisaben	Ethics :joy: haven't taken SE yet 
2017-10-11 10:27:34	carl	Last semester, they changed the time for SE. Maybe they'll do it again.  
2017-10-11 10:28:50	adyfrancis	Is it MWThu this semester?  
2017-10-11 10:30:30	carl	Yes 
2017-10-11 10:32:03	nmcroutw	CSC 495 (007) had 80% A's. Sign me up 
2017-10-11 10:33:55	chrisaben	What 495 though? 
2017-10-11 10:34:39	adyfrancis	Visual interfaces for mobile devices  
2017-10-11 10:34:59	adyfrancis	Only 30 seats though  
2017-10-11 10:35:01	carl	I need to have two CSC electives completed to do senior design, so I'm not sure if pushing it back is a good idea.  
2017-10-11 11:19:20	carl	@carl uploaded a file: https://sturgill-operators.slack.com/files/U3V2J18QG/F7GPVBJDA/image.png (image.png) and commented: r8 my schedule

2017-10-11 11:22:52	carl	That's the way I like it. I have class ending at 4:15 every day (M-Th) this semester and I'm not a fan. 
2017-10-11 11:27:49	carl	How many hours a week do y'all spend on CSC 326? 
2017-10-11 11:30:34	jesse	how many hours are in a week? 
2017-10-11 11:31:00	jkayani	Most of them 
2017-10-11 11:32:17	jesse	i would say i spent 40 to 50 each week on the last project. 
2017-10-11 11:32:25	carl	What is wrong this with class? :weary: 
2017-10-11 11:32:33	adyfrancis	Wtf 
2017-10-11 11:35:06	jesse	yeah. what I do, is get all my work for the other classes on one weekend day and then devote almost all my other time to software engineering. 
2017-10-11 11:35:50	carl	Someone should lead a strike. :thinking_face: 
2017-10-11 11:36:07	adyfrancis	Unionize the CSC class?? [:point_up:3] 
2017-10-11 11:38:39	carl	>  This course is based on reality, so the project will be as real-world as we can make it.... which might just mean that some aspects of the project may intentionally cause you some heartache (such as ill-defined AND/OR changing requirements). Remember, it's for your own good.
2017-10-11 11:38:39		Yeah, because every CSC grad is going to become a software engineer in industry... 
2017-10-11 11:42:24	chrisaben	I love how that is the course description though :joy: 
2017-10-11 11:46:34	adyfrancis	Is it that the projects are difficult to code? Or is it just a lot of components  
2017-10-11 11:48:01	chrisaben	I think it's just that the companies that assign them give really shitty requirements, unlike what we've been assigned in our other programming classes, and then they'll be like OH YEA WE'RE GONNA GO WITH THIS SHIT INSTEAD when you already spent several hours creating the component they originally wanted 
2017-10-11 11:49:04	mrgray4	@adyfrancis some bugs are difficult to find, but it's just a big ol pile of shit 
2017-10-11 11:49:06	mrgray4	as in a lot 
2017-10-11 11:49:22	jkayani	Delegating tasks and making sure everyone is in sync is the real challenge imo [:point_up:1] 
2017-10-11 11:49:23	carl	> the companies that assign them
2017-10-11 11:49:23		What does this mean? 
2017-10-11 11:49:37	jkayani	Especially when your team members are at different skill levels 
2017-10-11 11:50:04	jkayani	I had to hold my teammates hand the last 2 projects and it's exhausting 
2017-10-11 11:50:19	chrisaben	I heard that the projects are like company assignments? I may be thinking about senior design 
2017-10-11 11:50:37	chrisaben	Someone was describing the one of the classes in this way 
2017-10-11 11:50:48	mrgray4	Yep that's senior design 
2017-10-11 11:50:48	jkayani	Nah 326 you're multiple groups working on the same project to do the same things [:point_up:1] 
2017-10-11 11:51:06	jkayani	But it's separate code base per group 
2017-10-11 11:51:31	jkayani	So each group has an iTryst, and each group works too add the same bullshit to it 
2017-10-11 12:04:32	carl	Thinking from the perspective of The Communicative Constitution of Organization, it sounds like CSC 326 does almost everything wrong when it comes to the flow of communication. As the class seems to force organizational flexibility, I would assume that most groups never achieve an effective process of "organizational self-structuring" where they formalize their communication roles and methods. The class bypasses the "membership negotiation" communication flow by assigning random groups, which likely destroys the homogeneity of groups' goals and values. This makes it hard to define clear expectations for group members. Furthermore, this makes it even more difficult to be effective in the communication flow of "activity coordination" because members have little way of knowing the abilities and preferences of other group members. I would assume that there are also problems in "institutional positioning" because group assignments typically have one point of contact between the organization (the student group) and their publics (the teaching staff). This makes it challenging for the teaching staff to address imbalances in power and passion which is likely the driving force for decision-making in these groups. 
2017-10-11 12:05:00	carl	tl;dr not looking forward to this class at all 
2017-10-11 12:06:19	jkayani	You do get to pick your groups on the last, biggest project 
2017-10-11 12:06:42	carl	Based on this, the notion that the course is in any way reflective of the "real world" is folly because the communicative constitution of the student groups is fundamentally different from the communicative constitution of professional software development teams.  (edited)
2017-10-11 12:07:31	jkayani	And yeah there is 1 point of contact, but he's like a God in that he almost always has a solution and dedicates his life to this class [:point_up:1] 
2017-10-11 17:27:17	nmcroutw	Are any of you interning/working part time along with school? If so how many hours? I'm trying to decide if working 20 hours would be too much with classes 
2017-10-11 17:28:41	jesse	not me.  
2017-10-11 17:29:08	jkayani	I wouldn't do it 
2017-10-11 17:29:20	jkayani	For me anyway, with 326, hell no 
2017-10-11 17:29:24	carl	I'm working a few jobs currently. 20 hours definitely sounds like too much.  
2017-10-11 19:53:06	mrgray4	I like school and classes separate. Got offered for channeladvisor but turned it down for that reason. If you can go part time then maybe consider that if you?re not getting financial aid. Personally I?d say no 
2017-10-11 19:53:59	jesse	what is school without classes? :) 
2017-10-11 19:56:49	mbbennis	I'm doing 20 hours now, but I'm only in 11 hours of classes. I usually end up clocking a few hours under and I'm somehow less busy now than I have been in some full time semesters 
2017-10-11 19:57:06	mbbennis	But idk, it probably depends on the job 
2017-10-12 09:41:40	mrgray4	@mrgray4 uploaded a file: https://sturgill-operators.slack.com/files/U3WBH0F7G/F7GPV4MEV/screen_shot_2017-10-12_at_9.40.42_am.png (Screen Shot 2017-10-12 at 9.40.42 AM.png) and commented: Schedule ?\_(?)_/? . This will leave me with a CSC elective, a math elective, an other elective, and senior design (also a 100 fit level) 
2017-10-12 10:17:44	adyfrancis	To all my 495 homies https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TJmMcs4hGlp1lbd2BhCpUEZJBTnnhW5PdTZn0KHvSlc/edit 
2017-10-12 10:17:58	adyfrancis	Study guide  [:heart_eyes:1] 
2017-10-12 10:18:32	adyfrancis	P sure that's everything he can ask us  
2017-10-12 10:21:31	jesse	https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zEXElVJmPOV43AYAhHemp-UzrxOMfh2khvpZM4VallA/edit?usp=drivesdk 
2017-10-12 10:21:44	jesse	theres ours... but most of it is the same. 
2017-10-12 10:29:33	jesse	was the 'types of problems' what kowolenko talked about during the review day? 
2017-10-12 10:30:00	jesse	i was there but I didnt take notes on that. 
2017-10-12 10:30:07	adyfrancis	It was a part of the paper 
2017-10-12 10:30:38	adyfrancis	According to friends of my group mates who have taken the class before he asked "name 5 problems and give examples of each" 
2017-10-12 10:31:55	jesse	i dont recall us getting any paper. but I'll try to remember the ones in your sheet 
2017-10-12 10:32:22	adyfrancis	We were told to read a paper about types of problems  
2017-10-12 10:32:55	jesse	oh yeahhhh...  those readings  
2017-10-12 10:33:50	jesse	i didn't read them so that explains why it looked new 
2017-10-12 11:15:16	mrgray4	Hey I read that thing! I did a thing for once! [:+1::skin-tone-3:1] 
2017-10-16 10:03:53	nmcroutw	Is anyone in 401? How is it? 
2017-10-16 10:38:31	jkayani	Yeah 
2017-10-16 10:38:44	jkayani	It's alright - it can be a bit dry at times, b/c it's a lot of digging into protcols 
2017-10-17 10:11:19	adyfrancis	495 pals what are we supposed to talk about today? Something about data? 
2017-10-17 10:18:17	nmcroutw	We are presenting our databases. I wrote down we need to talk about schema, primary keys, and address formatting issues but idk exactly what all those are 
2017-10-17 10:19:03	adyfrancis	Yeah I wrote where I sourced data and primary keys for structured data but I was forgetting about the schema for unstructured  
2017-10-17 10:19:06	adyfrancis	Thanks! 
2017-10-19 15:37:21	mrgray4	Folks, I got the WillowTree internship!!! [:smile:3] 
2017-10-19 15:37:49	mrgray4	My recruiter had resigned leaving me in internship limbo, but I got through today and found out I have an offer :D 
2017-10-19 16:22:56	jesse	was the internship for a position as a recruiter? xD [:goshjosh:1] 
2017-10-19 16:23:07	jesse	congrats dude [:heart:1] 
2017-10-19 16:33:19	mrgray4	Yes, want an internship? 
2017-10-19 16:40:12	carl	:raising_hand: 
2017-10-19 16:43:26	mrgray4	Apply! For anyone interested, they really look positively on people who've done projects, ESPECIALLY mobile applications 
2017-11-29 10:13:26	jesse	Hey guys, one of my buddys might be getting a D in ethics and we were wondering if he would need to retake the course or not. Does anyone know? 
2017-11-29 10:17:08	carl	I don't think it's a prerequisite for anything, so I doubt it's C-walled.  
2017-11-29 10:20:43	jesse	true, but I thought there mightve been a rule about all CSC courses need to be C- or better... idk know and idk if it applies to 1 credit hour courses. 
2017-11-29 11:02:06	chrisaben	It's not c wall, I got a D- and it's checked off 
2017-11-29 11:14:40	jesse	nice. ill let my friend know. thanks. 
2017-12-21 21:38:59	carl	What is the general tech stack being used in Software Engineering these days? Would it be worth it to read up on some entry-level documentation for anything beforehand? 
2017-12-21 21:40:53	jesse	Java, and AngularJS are the big ones. The rest you can learn as you go. Selenium would help too. 
2017-12-21 21:41:32	carl	Angular 1 or Angular 2? 
2017-12-21 21:41:38	jesse	1 
2017-12-21 21:46:26	jesse	if i were you, i would get the iTrust2 project from github and learn what angularjs and selenium does and what functions/syntax to use. 
2017-12-21 21:47:15	jesse	https://github.ncsu.edu/engr-csc326-staff/iTrust-v23
2017-12-21 21:47:15		Build software better, together
2017-12-21 21:47:15		GitHub is where people build software. More than 15 million people use GitHub to discover, fork, and contribute to over 38 million projects. 
2017-12-21 21:51:08	carl	Thanks! It seems I know exactly the wrong frontend tools for this class (React+Jest and a smattering of whatever was trendy in 2015). I've heard of Selenium and Java, though. :thinking_face: 
2017-12-21 22:06:41	jesse	i think the biggest problem i had was I didnt even know what angular did or what selenium did. Nobody told us what any of that means and they threw in a bunch of fancy terms like Spring, and Hibernate as if they were relevant. 
2017-12-21 22:06:41		If you know that Angular is a tool to link up the HTML view with javascript variables, and you know how to make get and post requests (and what those mean), youll be fine.
2017-12-21 22:06:41		Selenium is for automated testing using a headless browser. sometimes it works, sometimes it doesnt. if it doesnt work, make your program wait for a few seconds after fetching a new page and try again.
2017-12-21 22:06:41		As for hibernate and spring, simple copy and paste of code elsewhere in itrust will do everything you could possibly ever want.  (edited)
2017-12-21 22:17:52	carl	I've never even heard of Spring or Hibernate. Thanks! 
2018-01-03 09:45:33	jkayani	Spring's just the Java framework they use for organizing the back end 
2018-01-03 09:46:03	jkayani	And Hibernate's an ORM (Object Relational Mapping? idk) that turns DB entities into Java objects (and vice versa) for easy manipulation in your backend [:+1::skin-tone-2:1] 
2018-01-03 09:47:06	jkayani	Honestly, it's not too difficult, and the tasks they have you do are pretty simple for the most part. If you know React, and you certainly know Java, you'll be fine imo [:+1:1] 
2018-01-03 09:48:21	jkayani	But yeah they could've done a better job explaining some of this in the course - wait until you get to Selenium and Cucumber, that's where I was confused for a while 
2018-01-03 09:51:52	jesse	yeah. they had webpages to explain those tools, but they would just explain that 
2018-01-03 09:51:52		hibernate --> object relational mapping
2018-01-03 09:51:52		its difficult for a newbie such as myself to understand what that means. at least, thats what annoyed me with coffeemaker 
2018-01-03 09:53:14	carl	"we made this hard so you'll never get to experience good software engineering" 
2018-01-03 09:53:51	jesse	xD what's good software engineering? 
2018-01-04 12:54:46	mrgray4	An oxymoron 
2018-01-04 12:55:15	mrgray4	We made it to another semester (I reset my computer pre-break and forgot to reinstall slack) 
2018-01-04 12:55:17	mrgray4	! 
2018-01-04 12:56:53	jesse	welcome back [:heart:1] 
2018-01-07 15:16:51	jkayani	What's the new Slack name going to be? Since most of us are done w. the required classes now 
2018-01-07 15:17:17	mrgray4	I was thinking about this the other day, but Heckman is still somewhat relevant to everyone, so I didn't change it yet 
2018-01-07 15:17:17	jkayani	save for senior design 
2018-01-07 15:17:21	mrgray4	Gladly taking ideas 
2018-01-07 15:17:32	mrgray4	I think @nmcroutw is the only senior designer this semester AFAIK 
2018-01-07 15:21:35	carl	When is everyone else taking senior design? 
2018-01-07 15:22:20	jkayani	Fall 2018 
2018-01-07 15:22:28	jkayani	tenatively 
2018-01-07 15:22:41	mrgray4	Same, not too tentatively because that's gradgitation time I think 
2018-01-07 15:23:03	jkayani	Yeah I'm on track to be done then, but in case this semester goes down the gutter 
2018-01-07 15:55:21	jesse	same. But I dont get the luxury of a gutter. :) 
2018-01-07 16:11:18	carl	Neat. I'm planning on taking it Spring 2019. Are y'all graduating in the Fall? [:fallen_leaf:1] 
2018-01-07 16:59:00	jesse	yeah. usually you have to take senior design last semester. 
2018-01-08 15:10:37	mrgray4	hypothetical, if you have a syllabus on git and you find a typo do you submit a PR 
2018-01-08 15:10:46	mrgray4	:thinking_face: 
2018-01-08 15:31:30	jesse	please tell me this happened to ya 
2018-01-08 15:31:59	mrgray4	I've thought about submitting the PR but I don't want to because it's just ". he" instead of ". the" 
2018-01-08 15:32:46	jesse	do it. for no other reason than you can xD 
2018-01-08 15:47:13	nmcroutw	That would be a pretty savage fdoc move

2018-03-14 11:26:01	mrgray4	What is everyone taking next semester? I was looking at CSC440, but the rate my professor reviews are some of the worst I've seen :! 
2018-03-14 11:48:06	jkayani	Yeah we were all thinking 440 but alas, it's not Chirkova teaching it 
2018-03-14 11:56:58	mrgray4	She is teaching 442 though, what about that? 
2018-03-14 11:57:05	mrgray4	I'm also looking at compiler theory, a 495 
2018-03-14 13:51:27	jkayani	What's 442? 
2018-03-14 14:27:01	jesse	i was kinda hoping I could only take 495  csc electives haha. but other than software security, ill be in human computer interaction if i can get in. 
2018-03-14 14:27:26	jesse	dunno what 442 is though. 
2018-03-14 14:33:01	jesse	i also plan on taking senior design and 2 psy courses: ergonomics and whatever psy 307 is... 
2018-03-14 14:45:22	mrgray4	I think 442 is data science 
2018-03-14 14:45:29	mrgray4	It looks like a slight continuation of data structures 
2018-03-14 14:45:51	mrgray4	jeez louise jesse 
2018-03-14 14:48:29	jesse	i know, ergonomics sounds horrible. 
2018-03-18 14:14:33	mrgray4	Is mypack down for anyone else? 
2018-03-18 14:14:46	mrgray4	Tried in safari and chrome, both are fubar'd

2018-03-18 14:15:04	mrgray4	I want mypack to be a senior design project 
2018-03-18 14:16:28	gjabell	see, you say that... but can you imagine being given the current code and told to improve it xD 
2018-03-18 14:16:48	mrgray4	No, like from scratch. Given API specs. 
2018-03-18 14:16:51	mrgray4	Fuck the current code 
2018-03-18 14:17:04	mrgray4	Going from scratch would take a few semesters, but it'd have so many possibilities

2017-10-10 13:29:19	jkayani	@jkayani uploaded a file: https://sturgill-operators.slack.com/files/U3VP4JQPL/F7GA0KDU5/screenshot_20171010-132857.png (Screenshot_20171010-132857.png) and commented: No label at all haha 
2017-10-10 13:30:06	chrisaben	You signed the financial responsibility waiver first right? [:+1:1] 
2017-10-10 13:30:19	jkayani	Ooh no I haven't 
2017-10-10 13:30:24	jkayani	Good call 
2017-10-10 13:30:35	nmcroutw	It says October 20 @jkayani  
2017-10-10 13:31:16	chrisaben	^oh Yea, she's right :joy: 
2017-10-10 13:31:30	jkayani	No no I see that, I'm just saying the date has no label 
2017-10-10 13:31:56	jkayani	Like it doesn't say what that date is, it's literally just there so I have to infer thats what it means 
2017-10-10 13:32:08	chrisaben	Oh gotchu 
2017-10-10 13:32:43	jkayani	Silly MyPack 
2017-10-11 09:20:06	carl	I'm going to need to bribe whoever schedules software engineering 
2017-10-11 09:33:44	mrgray4	Hahaha why do you say that 
2017-10-11 09:34:05	mrgray4	Also who's hopping on that ethics train next semester? 
2017-10-11 09:34:27	carl	They scheduled it at the same time as a class I have to take with only one section offered. Again... [:confused:2 :cry:1] 
2017-10-11 09:34:31	jkayani	Ugh I have to do a reflection for that class and I didn't even go last time [:pensive:1] 
2017-10-11 09:34:59	mrgray4	You could do SE and Senior Design back to back semesters senior year 
2017-10-11 09:36:08	adyfrancis	Ethics: the only one credit hour class that's a bigger pain in the ass than my 3 credit hour classes [:+1:3] 
2017-10-11 09:36:30	mrgray4	Thanks for getting me excited :smile: 
2017-10-11 09:37:04	adyfrancis	I'm slight exaggerating but it is annoying  
2017-10-11 09:37:26	adyfrancis	Anyone have prof recommendations for Software Engineering? 
2017-10-11 09:39:17	chrisaben	I got a D- in that class because the teacher is the worst 
2017-10-11 09:39:43	adyfrancis	Shit there's only one professor  
2017-10-11 09:43:22	jkayani	A D- in ethics or SE @chrisaben ? 
2017-10-11 09:43:55	jkayani	SE with Heckman is good; although tbh your instructor doesn't seem to matter as much as your TAs 
2017-10-11 09:54:24	chrisaben	Ethics :joy: haven't taken SE yet 
2017-10-11 10:27:34	carl	Last semester, they changed the time for SE. Maybe they'll do it again.  
2017-10-11 10:28:50	adyfrancis	Is it MWThu this semester?  
2017-10-11 10:30:30	carl	Yes 
2017-10-11 10:32:03	nmcroutw	CSC 495 (007) had 80% A's. Sign me up 
2017-10-11 10:33:55	chrisaben	What 495 though? 
2017-10-11 10:34:39	adyfrancis	Visual interfaces for mobile devices  
2017-10-11 10:34:59	adyfrancis	Only 30 seats though  
2017-10-11 10:35:01	carl	I need to have two CSC electives completed to do senior design, so I'm not sure if pushing it back is a good idea.  
2017-10-11 11:19:20	carl	@carl uploaded a file: https://sturgill-operators.slack.com/files/U3V2J18QG/F7GPVBJDA/image.png (image.png) and commented: r8 my schedule 
2017-10-11 11:21:54	mrgray4	5/7 
2017-10-11 11:22:09	mrgray4	Your afternoons look so nice and free! 
2017-10-11 11:22:52	carl	That's the way I like it. I have class ending at 4:15 every day (M-Th) this semester and I'm not a fan. 
2017-10-11 11:27:49	carl	How many hours a week do y'all spend on CSC 326? 
2017-10-11 11:30:34	jesse	how many hours are in a week? 
2017-10-11 11:31:00	jkayani	Most of them 
2017-10-11 11:32:17	jesse	i would say i spent 40 to 50 each week on the last project. 
2017-10-11 11:32:25	carl	What is wrong this with class? :weary: 
2017-10-11 11:32:33	adyfrancis	Wtf 
2017-10-11 11:35:06	jesse	yeah. what I do, is get all my work for the other classes on one weekend day and then devote almost all my other time to software engineering. 
2017-10-11 11:35:50	carl	Someone should lead a strike. :thinking_face: 
2017-10-11 11:36:07	adyfrancis	Unionize the CSC class?? [:point_up:3] 
2017-10-11 11:38:39	carl	>  This course is based on reality, so the project will be as real-world as we can make it.... which might just mean that some aspects of the project may intentionally cause you some heartache (such as ill-defined AND/OR changing requirements). Remember, it's for your own good.
2017-10-11 11:38:39		Yeah, because every CSC grad is going to become a software engineer in industry... 
2017-10-11 11:42:24	chrisaben	I love how that is the course description though :joy: 
2017-10-11 11:46:34	adyfrancis	Is it that the projects are difficult to code? Or is it just a lot of components  
2017-10-11 11:48:01	chrisaben	I think it's just that the companies that assign them give really shitty requirements, unlike what we've been assigned in our other programming classes, and then they'll be like OH YEA WE'RE GONNA GO WITH THIS SHIT INSTEAD when you already spent several hours creating the component they originally wanted 
2017-10-11 11:49:04	mrgray4	@adyfrancis some bugs are difficult to find, but it's just a big ol pile of shit 
2017-10-11 11:49:06	mrgray4	as in a lot 
2017-10-11 11:49:22	jkayani	Delegating tasks and making sure everyone is in sync is the real challenge imo [:point_up:1] 
2017-10-11 11:49:23	carl	> the companies that assign them
2017-10-11 11:49:23		What does this mean? 
2017-10-11 11:49:37	jkayani	Especially when your team members are at different skill levels 
2017-10-11 11:50:04	jkayani	I had to hold my teammates hand the last 2 projects and it's exhausting 
2017-10-11 11:50:19	chrisaben	I heard that the projects are like company assignments? I may be thinking about senior design 
2017-10-11 11:50:37	chrisaben	Someone was describing the one of the classes in this way 
2017-10-11 11:50:48	mrgray4	Yep that's senior design 
2017-10-11 11:50:48	jkayani	Nah 326 you're multiple groups working on the same project to do the same things [:point_up:1] 
2017-10-11 11:51:06	jkayani	But it's separate code base per group 
2017-10-11 11:51:31	jkayani	So each group has an iTryst, and each group works too add the same bullshit to it 
2017-10-11 12:04:32	carl	Thinking from the perspective of The Communicative Constitution of Organization, it sounds like CSC 326 does almost everything wrong when it comes to the flow of communication. As the class seems to force organizational flexibility, I would assume that most groups never achieve an effective process of "organizational self-structuring" where they formalize their communication roles and methods. The class bypasses the "membership negotiation" communication flow by assigning random groups, which likely destroys the homogeneity of groups' goals and values. This makes it hard to define clear expectations for group members. Furthermore, this makes it even more difficult to be effective in the communication flow of "activity coordination" because members have little way of knowing the abilities and preferences of other group members. I would assume that there are also problems in "institutional positioning" because group assignments typically have one point of contact between the organization (the student group) and their publics (the teaching staff). This makes it challenging for the teaching staff to address imbalances in power and passion which is likely the driving force for decision-making in these groups. 
2017-10-11 12:05:00	carl	tl;dr not looking forward to this class at all 
2017-10-11 12:06:19	jkayani	You do get to pick your groups on the last, biggest project 
2017-10-11 12:06:42	carl	Based on this, the notion that the course is in any way reflective of the "real world" is folly because the communicative constitution of the student groups is fundamentally different from the communicative constitution of professional software development teams.  (edited)
2017-10-11 12:07:31	jkayani	And yeah there is 1 point of contact, but he's like a God in that he almost always has a solution and dedicates his life to this class [:point_up:1] 
2017-10-11 17:27:17	nmcroutw	Are any of you interning/working part time along with school? If so how many hours? I'm trying to decide if working 20 hours would be too much with classes 
2017-10-11 17:28:41	jesse	not me.  
2017-10-11 17:29:08	jkayani	I wouldn't do it 
2017-10-11 17:29:20	jkayani	For me anyway, with 326, hell no 
2017-10-11 17:29:24	carl	I'm working a few jobs currently. 20 hours definitely sounds like too much.  
2017-10-11 19:53:06	mrgray4	I like school and classes separate. Got offered for channeladvisor but turned it down for that reason. If you can go part time then maybe consider that if you?re not getting financial aid. Personally I?d say no 
2017-10-11 19:53:59	jesse	what is school without classes? :) 
2017-10-11 19:56:49	mbbennis	I'm doing 20 hours now, but I'm only in 11 hours of classes. I usually end up clocking a few hours under and I'm somehow less busy now than I have been in some full time semesters 
2017-10-11 19:57:06	mbbennis	But idk, it probably depends on the job 
2017-10-12 09:41:40	mrgray4	@mrgray4 uploaded a file: https://sturgill-operators.slack.com/files/U3WBH0F7G/F7GPV4MEV/screen_shot_2017-10-12_at_9.40.42_am.png (Screen Shot 2017-10-12 at 9.40.42 AM.png) and commented: Schedule ?\_(?)_/? . This will leave me with a CSC elective, a math elective, an other elective, and senior design (also a 100 fit level) 
2017-10-12 10:17:44	adyfrancis	To all my 495 homies https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TJmMcs4hGlp1lbd2BhCpUEZJBTnnhW5PdTZn0KHvSlc/edit 
2017-10-12 10:17:58	adyfrancis	Study guide  [:heart_eyes:1] 
2017-10-12 10:18:32	adyfrancis	P sure that's everything he can ask us  
2017-10-12 10:21:31	jesse	https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zEXElVJmPOV43AYAhHemp-UzrxOMfh2khvpZM4VallA/edit?usp=drivesdk 
2017-10-12 10:21:44	jesse	theres ours... but most of it is the same. 
2017-10-12 10:29:33	jesse	was the 'types of problems' what kowolenko talked about during the review day? 
2017-10-12 10:30:00	jesse	i was there but I didnt take notes on that. 
2017-10-12 10:30:07	adyfrancis	It was a part of the paper 
2017-10-12 10:30:38	adyfrancis	According to friends of my group mates who have taken the class before he asked "name 5 problems and give examples of each" 
2017-10-12 10:31:55	jesse	i dont recall us getting any paper. but I'll try to remember the ones in your sheet 
2017-10-12 10:32:22	adyfrancis	We were told to read a paper about types of problems  
2017-10-12 10:32:55	jesse	oh yeahhhh...  those readings  
2017-10-12 10:33:50	jesse	i didn't read them so that explains why it looked new 
2017-10-12 11:15:16	mrgray4	Hey I read that thing! I did a thing for once! [:+1::skin-tone-3:1] 
2017-10-16 10:03:53	nmcroutw	Is anyone in 401? How is it? 
2017-10-16 10:38:31	jkayani	Yeah 
2017-10-16 10:38:44	jkayani	It's alright - it can be a bit dry at times, b/c it's a lot of digging into protcols 
2017-10-17 10:11:19	adyfrancis	495 pals what are we supposed to talk about today? Something about data? 
2017-10-17 10:18:17	nmcroutw	We are presenting our databases. I wrote down we need to talk about schema, primary keys, and address formatting issues but idk exactly what all those are 
2017-10-17 10:19:03	adyfrancis	Yeah I wrote where I sourced data and primary keys for structured data but I was forgetting about the schema for unstructured  
2017-10-17 10:19:06	adyfrancis	Thanks! 
2017-10-19 15:37:21	mrgray4	Folks, I got the WillowTree internship!!! [:smile:3] 
2017-10-19 15:37:49	mrgray4	My recruiter had resigned leaving me in internship limbo, but I got through today and found out I have an offer :D 
2017-10-19 16:22:56	jesse	was the internship for a position as a recruiter? xD [:goshjosh:1] 
2017-10-19 16:23:07	jesse	congrats dude [:heart:1] 
2017-10-19 16:33:19	mrgray4	Yes, want an internship? 
2017-10-19 16:40:12	carl	:raising_hand: 
2017-10-19 16:43:26	mrgray4	Apply! For anyone interested, they really look positively on people who've done projects, ESPECIALLY mobile applications 
2017-11-29 10:13:26	jesse	Hey guys, one of my buddys might be getting a D in ethics and we were wondering if he would need to retake the course or not. Does anyone know? 
2017-11-29 10:17:08	carl	I don't think it's a prerequisite for anything, so I doubt it's C-walled.  
2017-11-29 10:20:43	jesse	true, but I thought there mightve been a rule about all CSC courses need to be C- or better... idk know and idk if it applies to 1 credit hour courses. 
2017-11-29 11:02:06	chrisaben	It's not c wall, I got a D- and it's checked off 
2017-11-29 11:14:40	jesse	nice. ill let my friend know. thanks. 
2017-12-21 21:38:59	carl	What is the general tech stack being used in Software Engineering these days? Would it be worth it to read up on some entry-level documentation for anything beforehand? 
2017-12-21 21:40:53	jesse	Java, and AngularJS are the big ones. The rest you can learn as you go. Selenium would help too. 
2017-12-21 21:41:32	carl	Angular 1 or Angular 2? 
2017-12-21 21:41:38	jesse	1 
2017-12-21 21:46:26	jesse	if i were you, i would get the iTrust2 project from github and learn what angularjs and selenium does and what functions/syntax to use. 
2017-12-21 21:47:15	jesse	https://github.ncsu.edu/engr-csc326-staff/iTrust-v23
2017-12-21 21:47:15		Build software better, together
2017-12-21 21:47:15		GitHub is where people build software. More than 15 million people use GitHub to discover, fork, and contribute to over 38 million projects. 
2017-12-21 21:51:08	carl	Thanks! It seems I know exactly the wrong frontend tools for this class (React+Jest and a smattering of whatever was trendy in 2015). I've heard of Selenium and Java, though. :thinking_face: 
2017-12-21 22:06:41	jesse	i think the biggest problem i had was I didnt even know what angular did or what selenium did. Nobody told us what any of that means and they threw in a bunch of fancy terms like Spring, and Hibernate as if they were relevant. 
2017-12-21 22:06:41		If you know that Angular is a tool to link up the HTML view with javascript variables, and you know how to make get and post requests (and what those mean), youll be fine.
2017-12-21 22:06:41		Selenium is for automated testing using a headless browser. sometimes it works, sometimes it doesnt. if it doesnt work, make your program wait for a few seconds after fetching a new page and try again.
2017-12-21 22:06:41		As for hibernate and spring, simple copy and paste of code elsewhere in itrust will do everything you could possibly ever want.  (edited)
2017-12-21 22:17:52	carl	I've never even heard of Spring or Hibernate. Thanks! 
2018-01-03 09:45:33	jkayani	Spring's just the Java framework they use for organizing the back end 
2018-01-03 09:46:03	jkayani	And Hibernate's an ORM (Object Relational Mapping? idk) that turns DB entities into Java objects (and vice versa) for easy manipulation in your backend [:+1::skin-tone-2:1] 
2018-01-03 09:47:06	jkayani	Honestly, it's not too difficult, and the tasks they have you do are pretty simple for the most part. If you know React, and you certainly know Java, you'll be fine imo [:+1:1] 
2018-01-03 09:48:21	jkayani	But yeah they could've done a better job explaining some of this in the course - wait until you get to Selenium and Cucumber, that's where I was confused for a while 
2018-01-03 09:51:52	jesse	yeah. they had webpages to explain those tools, but they would just explain that 
2018-01-03 09:51:52		hibernate --> object relational mapping
2018-01-03 09:51:52		its difficult for a newbie such as myself to understand what that means. at least, thats what annoyed me with coffeemaker 
2018-01-03 09:53:14	carl	"we made this hard so you'll never get to experience good software engineering" 
2018-01-03 09:53:51	jesse	xD what's good software engineering? 
2018-01-04 12:54:46	mrgray4	An oxymoron 
2018-01-04 12:55:15	mrgray4	We made it to another semester (I reset my computer pre-break and forgot to reinstall slack) 
2018-01-04 12:55:17	mrgray4	! 
2018-01-04 12:56:53	jesse	welcome back [:heart:1] 
2018-01-07 15:16:51	jkayani	What's the new Slack name going to be? Since most of us are done w. the required classes now 
2018-01-07 15:17:17	mrgray4	I was thinking about this the other day, but Heckman is still somewhat relevant to everyone, so I didn't change it yet 
2018-01-07 15:17:17	jkayani	save for senior design 
2018-01-07 15:17:21	mrgray4	Gladly taking ideas 
2018-01-07 15:17:32	mrgray4	I think @nmcroutw is the only senior designer this semester AFAIK 
2018-01-07 15:21:35	carl	When is everyone else taking senior design? 
2018-01-07 15:22:20	jkayani	Fall 2018 
2018-01-07 15:22:28	jkayani	tenatively 
2018-01-07 15:22:41	mrgray4	Same, not too tentatively because that's gradgitation time I think 
2018-01-07 15:23:03	jkayani	Yeah I'm on track to be done then, but in case this semester goes down the gutter 
2018-01-07 15:55:21	jesse	same. But I dont get the luxury of a gutter. :) 
2018-01-07 16:11:18	carl	Neat. I'm planning on taking it Spring 2019. Are y'all graduating in the Fall? [:fallen_leaf:1] 
2018-01-07 16:59:00	jesse	yeah. usually you have to take senior design last semester. 
2018-01-08 15:10:37	mrgray4	hypothetical, if you have a syllabus on git and you find a typo do you submit a PR 
2018-01-08 15:10:46	mrgray4	:thinking_face: 
2018-01-08 15:31:30	jesse	please tell me this happened to ya 
2018-01-08 15:31:59	mrgray4	I've thought about submitting the PR but I don't want to because it's just ". he" instead of ". the" 
2018-01-08 15:32:46	jesse	do it. for no other reason than you can xD 
2018-01-08 15:47:13	nmcroutw	That would be a pretty savage fdoc move

2018-02-16 09:56:54	-->		@AndrewWright has joined the channel 
2018-02-16 09:58:23	AndrewWright	yo whats good fam 
2018-02-16 10:02:46	mrgray4	Good news everyone! New emojis available: :party_parrot: :fast_party_parrot: :fidget: 
2018-03-14 11:26:01	mrgray4	What is everyone taking next semester? I was looking at CSC440, but the rate my professor reviews are some of the worst I've seen :! 
2018-03-14 11:48:06	jkayani	Yeah we were all thinking 440 but alas, it's not Chirkova teaching it 
2018-03-14 11:56:58	mrgray4	She is teaching 442 though, what about that? 
2018-03-14 11:57:05	mrgray4	I'm also looking at compiler theory, a 495 
2018-03-14 13:51:27	jkayani	What's 442? 
2018-03-14 14:27:01	jesse	i was kinda hoping I could only take 495  csc electives haha. but other than software security, ill be in human computer interaction if i can get in. 
2018-03-14 14:27:26	jesse	dunno what 442 is though. 
2018-03-14 14:33:01	jesse	i also plan on taking senior design and 2 psy courses: ergonomics and whatever psy 307 is... 
2018-03-14 14:45:22	mrgray4	I think 442 is data science 
2018-03-14 14:45:29	mrgray4	It looks like a slight continuation of data structures 
2018-03-14 14:45:51	mrgray4	jeez louise jesse 
2018-03-14 14:48:29	jesse	i know, ergonomics sounds horrible. 
2018-03-18 14:14:33	mrgray4	Is mypack down for anyone else? 
2018-03-18 14:14:46	mrgray4	Tried in safari and chrome, both are fubar'd 
2018-03-18 14:14:49	gjabell	yep 
2018-03-18 14:14:54	mrgray4	rip 
2018-03-18 14:14:54	gjabell	is broke 
2018-03-18 14:15:04	mrgray4	I want mypack to be a senior design project 
2018-03-18 14:16:28	gjabell	see, you say that... but can you imagine being given the current code and told to improve it xD 
2018-03-18 14:16:48	mrgray4	No, like from scratch. Given API specs. 
2018-03-18 14:16:51	mrgray4	Fuck the current code 
2018-03-18 14:17:04	mrgray4	Going from scratch would take a few semesters, but it'd have so many possibilities 
2018-03-18 14:20:37	gjabell	yeah 
2018-03-22 16:02:45	jkayani	@jkayani uploaded a file: https://sturgill-operators.slack.com/files/U3VP4JQPL/F9UJ65RJQ/screenshot_20180322-155844.png (Screenshot_20180322-155844.png) and commented: You guys see this? 
2018-03-22 16:09:27	gjabell	Yep 
2018-03-22 16:09:36	gjabell	I was in cloud computing lol 
2018-03-22 16:10:17	jkayani	Thought it was a hoax at first, but then Marini sent the same thing 
2018-03-22 16:10:31	gjabell	plus it isn't april first lol 
2018-03-22 16:11:03	jkayani	You'd think the university would send a text or something 
2018-03-22 16:12:41	gjabell	yeah 
2018-04-09 22:06:24		getting channel history...
2017-10-11 09:39:43	adyfrancis	Shit there's only one professor  
2017-10-11 09:43:22	jkayani	A D- in ethics or SE @chrisaben ? 
2017-10-11 09:43:55	jkayani	SE with Heckman is good; although tbh your instructor doesn't seem to matter as much as your TAs 
2017-10-11 09:54:24	chrisaben	Ethics :joy: haven't taken SE yet 
2017-10-11 10:27:34	carl	Last semester, they changed the time for SE. Maybe they'll do it again.  
2017-10-11 10:28:50	adyfrancis	Is it MWThu this semester?  
2017-10-11 10:30:30	carl	Yes 
2017-10-11 10:32:03	nmcroutw	CSC 495 (007) had 80% A's. Sign me up 
2017-10-11 10:33:55	chrisaben	What 495 though? 
2017-10-11 10:34:39	adyfrancis	Visual interfaces for mobile devices  
2017-10-11 10:34:59	adyfrancis	Only 30 seats though  
2017-10-11 10:35:01	carl	I need to have two CSC electives completed to do senior design, so I'm not sure if pushing it back is a good idea.  
2017-10-11 11:19:20	carl	@carl uploaded a file: https://sturgill-operators.slack.com/files/U3V2J18QG/F7GPVBJDA/image.png (image.png) and commented: r8 my schedule 
2017-10-11 11:21:54	mrgray4	5/7 
2017-10-11 11:22:09	mrgray4	Your afternoons look so nice and free! 
2017-10-11 11:22:52	carl	That's the way I like it. I have class ending at 4:15 every day (M-Th) this semester and I'm not a fan. 
2017-10-11 11:27:49	carl	How many hours a week do y'all spend on CSC 326? 
2017-10-11 11:30:34	jesse	how many hours are in a week? 
2017-10-11 11:31:00	jkayani	Most of them 
2017-10-11 11:32:17	jesse	i would say i spent 40 to 50 each week on the last project. 
2017-10-11 11:32:25	carl	What is wrong this with class? :weary: 
2017-10-11 11:32:33	adyfrancis	Wtf 
2017-10-11 11:35:06	jesse	yeah. what I do, is get all my work for the other classes on one weekend day and then devote almost all my other time to software engineering. 
2017-10-11 11:35:50	carl	Someone should lead a strike. :thinking_face: 
2017-10-11 11:36:07	adyfrancis	Unionize the CSC class?? [:point_up:3] 
2017-10-11 11:38:39	carl	>  This course is based on reality, so the project will be as real-world as we can make it.... which might just mean that some aspects of the project may intentionally cause you some heartache (such as ill-defined AND/OR changing requirements). Remember, it's for your own good.
2017-10-11 11:38:39		Yeah, because every CSC grad is going to become a software engineer in industry... 
2017-10-11 11:42:24	chrisaben	I love how that is the course description though :joy: 
2017-10-11 11:46:34	adyfrancis	Is it that the projects are difficult to code? Or is it just a lot of components  
2017-10-11 11:48:01	chrisaben	I think it's just that the companies that assign them give really shitty requirements, unlike what we've been assigned in our other programming classes, and then they'll be like OH YEA WE'RE GONNA GO WITH THIS SHIT INSTEAD when you already spent several hours creating the component they originally wanted 
2017-10-11 11:49:04	mrgray4	@adyfrancis some bugs are difficult to find, but it's just a big ol pile of shit 
2017-10-11 11:49:06	mrgray4	as in a lot 
2017-10-11 11:49:22	jkayani	Delegating tasks and making sure everyone is in sync is the real challenge imo [:point_up:1] 
2017-10-11 11:49:23	carl	> the companies that assign them
2017-10-11 11:49:23		What does this mean? 
2017-10-11 11:49:37	jkayani	Especially when your team members are at different skill levels 
2017-10-11 11:50:04	jkayani	I had to hold my teammates hand the last 2 projects and it's exhausting 
2017-10-11 11:50:19	chrisaben	I heard that the projects are like company assignments? I may be thinking about senior design 
2017-10-11 11:50:37	chrisaben	Someone was describing the one of the classes in this way 
2017-10-11 11:50:48	mrgray4	Yep that's senior design 
2017-10-11 11:50:48	jkayani	Nah 326 you're multiple groups working on the same project to do the same things [:point_up:1] 
2017-10-11 11:51:06	jkayani	But it's separate code base per group 
2017-10-11 11:51:31	jkayani	So each group has an iTryst, and each group works too add the same bullshit to it 
2017-10-11 12:04:32	carl	Thinking from the perspective of The Communicative Constitution of Organization, it sounds like CSC 326 does almost everything wrong when it comes to the flow of communication. As the class seems to force organizational flexibility, I would assume that most groups never achieve an effective process of "organizational self-structuring" where they formalize their communication roles and methods. The class bypasses the "membership negotiation" communication flow by assigning random groups, which likely destroys the homogeneity of groups' goals and values. This makes it hard to define clear expectations for group members. Furthermore, this makes it even more difficult to be effective in the communication flow of "activity coordination" because members have little way of knowing the abilities and preferences of other group members. I would assume that there are also problems in "institutional positioning" because group assignments typically have one point of contact between the organization (the student group) and their publics (the teaching staff). This makes it challenging for the teaching staff to address imbalances in power and passion which is likely the driving force for decision-making in these groups. 
2017-10-11 12:05:00	carl	tl;dr not looking forward to this class at all 
2017-10-11 12:06:19	jkayani	You do get to pick your groups on the last, biggest project 
2017-10-11 12:06:42	carl	Based on this, the notion that the course is in any way reflective of the "real world" is folly because the communicative constitution of the student groups is fundamentally different from the communicative constitution of professional software development teams.  (edited)
2017-10-11 12:07:31	jkayani	And yeah there is 1 point of contact, but he's like a God in that he almost always has a solution and dedicates his life to this class [:point_up:1] 
2017-10-11 17:27:17	nmcroutw	Are any of you interning/working part time along with school? If so how many hours? I'm trying to decide if working 20 hours would be too much with classes 
2017-10-11 17:28:41	jesse	not me.  
2017-10-11 17:29:08	jkayani	I wouldn't do it 
2017-10-11 17:29:20	jkayani	For me anyway, with 326, hell no 
2017-10-11 17:29:24	carl	I'm working a few jobs currently. 20 hours definitely sounds like too much.  
2017-10-11 19:53:06	mrgray4	I like school and classes separate. Got offered for channeladvisor but turned it down for that reason. If you can go part time then maybe consider that if you?re not getting financial aid. Personally I?d say no 
2017-10-11 19:53:59	jesse	what is school without classes? :) 
2017-10-11 19:56:49	mbbennis	I'm doing 20 hours now, but I'm only in 11 hours of classes. I usually end up clocking a few hours under and I'm somehow less busy now than I have been in some full time semesters 
2017-10-11 19:57:06	mbbennis	But idk, it probably depends on the job 
2017-10-12 09:41:40	mrgray4	@mrgray4 uploaded a file: https://sturgill-operators.slack.com/files/U3WBH0F7G/F7GPV4MEV/screen_shot_2017-10-12_at_9.40.42_am.png (Screen Shot 2017-10-12 at 9.40.42 AM.png) and commented: Schedule ?\_(?)_/? . This will leave me with a CSC elective, a math elective, an other elective, and senior design (also a 100 fit level)

2017-10-12 10:17:58	adyfrancis	Study guide  [:heart_eyes:1] 
2017-10-12 10:18:32	adyfrancis	P sure that's everything he can ask us  
2017-10-12 10:21:31	jesse	https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zEXElVJmPOV43AYAhHemp-UzrxOMfh2khvpZM4VallA/edit?usp=drivesdk 
2017-10-12 10:21:44	jesse	theres ours... but most of it is the same. 
2017-10-12 10:29:33	jesse	was the 'types of problems' what kowolenko talked about during the review day? 
2017-10-12 10:30:00	jesse	i was there but I didnt take notes on that. 
2017-10-12 10:30:07	adyfrancis	It was a part of the paper 
2017-10-12 10:30:38	adyfrancis	According to friends of my group mates who have taken the class before he asked "name 5 problems and give examples of each" 
2017-10-12 10:31:55	jesse	i dont recall us getting any paper. but I'll try to remember the ones in your sheet 
2017-10-12 10:32:22	adyfrancis	We were told to read a paper about types of problems  
2017-10-12 10:32:55	jesse	oh yeahhhh...  those readings  
2017-10-12 10:33:50	jesse	i didn't read them so that explains why it looked new 
2017-10-12 11:15:16	mrgray4	Hey I read that thing! I did a thing for once! [:+1::skin-tone-3:1] 
2017-10-16 10:03:53	nmcroutw	Is anyone in 401? How is it? 
2017-10-16 10:38:31	jkayani	Yeah 
2017-10-16 10:38:44	jkayani	It's alright - it can be a bit dry at times, b/c it's a lot of digging into protcols 
2017-10-17 10:11:19	adyfrancis	495 pals what are we supposed to talk about today? Something about data? 
2017-10-17 10:18:17	nmcroutw	We are presenting our databases. I wrote down we need to talk about schema, primary keys, and address formatting issues but idk exactly what all those are 
2017-10-17 10:19:03	adyfrancis	Yeah I wrote where I sourced data and primary keys for structured data but I was forgetting about the schema for unstructured  
2017-10-17 10:19:06	adyfrancis	Thanks! 
2017-10-19 15:37:21	mrgray4	Folks, I got the WillowTree internship!!! [:smile:3] 
2017-10-19 15:37:49	mrgray4	My recruiter had resigned leaving me in internship limbo, but I got through today and found out I have an offer :D 
2017-10-19 16:22:56	jesse	was the internship for a position as a recruiter? xD [:goshjosh:1] 
2017-10-19 16:23:07	jesse	congrats dude [:heart:1] 
2017-10-19 16:33:19	mrgray4	Yes, want an internship? 
2017-10-19 16:40:12	carl	:raising_hand: 
2017-10-19 16:43:26	mrgray4	Apply! For anyone interested, they really look positively on people who've done projects, ESPECIALLY mobile applications 
2017-11-29 10:13:26	jesse	Hey guys, one of my buddys might be getting a D in ethics and we were wondering if he would need to retake the course or not. Does anyone know? 
2017-11-29 10:17:08	carl	I don't think it's a prerequisite for anything, so I doubt it's C-walled.  
2017-11-29 10:20:43	jesse	true, but I thought there mightve been a rule about all CSC courses need to be C- or better... idk know and idk if it applies to 1 credit hour courses. 
2017-11-29 11:02:06	chrisaben	It's not c wall, I got a D- and it's checked off 
2017-11-29 11:14:40	jesse	nice. ill let my friend know. thanks. 
2017-12-21 21:38:59	carl	What is the general tech stack being used in Software Engineering these days? Would it be worth it to read up on some entry-level documentation for anything beforehand? 
2017-12-21 21:40:53	jesse	Java, and AngularJS are the big ones. The rest you can learn as you go. Selenium would help too. 
2017-12-21 21:41:32	carl	Angular 1 or Angular 2? 
2017-12-21 21:41:38	jesse	1 
2017-12-21 21:46:26	jesse	if i were you, i would get the iTrust2 project from github and learn what angularjs and selenium does and what functions/syntax to use. 
2017-12-21 21:47:15	jesse	https://github.ncsu.edu/engr-csc326-staff/iTrust-v23
2017-12-21 21:47:15		Build software better, together
2017-12-21 21:47:15		GitHub is where people build software. More than 15 million people use GitHub to discover, fork, and contribute to over 38 million projects. 
2017-12-21 21:51:08	carl	Thanks! It seems I know exactly the wrong frontend tools for this class (React+Jest and a smattering of whatever was trendy in 2015). I've heard of Selenium and Java, though. :thinking_face: 
2017-12-21 22:06:41	jesse	i think the biggest problem i had was I didnt even know what angular did or what selenium did. Nobody told us what any of that means and they threw in a bunch of fancy terms like Spring, and Hibernate as if they were relevant. 
2017-12-21 22:06:41		If you know that Angular is a tool to link up the HTML view with javascript variables, and you know how to make get and post requests (and what those mean), youll be fine.
2017-12-21 22:06:41		Selenium is for automated testing using a headless browser. sometimes it works, sometimes it doesnt. if it doesnt work, make your program wait for a few seconds after fetching a new page and try again.
2017-12-21 22:06:41		As for hibernate and spring, simple copy and paste of code elsewhere in itrust will do everything you could possibly ever want.  (edited)
2017-12-21 22:17:52	carl	I've never even heard of Spring or Hibernate. Thanks! 
2018-01-03 09:45:33	jkayani	Spring's just the Java framework they use for organizing the back end 
2018-01-03 09:46:03	jkayani	And Hibernate's an ORM (Object Relational Mapping? idk) that turns DB entities into Java objects (and vice versa) for easy manipulation in your backend [:+1::skin-tone-2:1] 
2018-01-03 09:47:06	jkayani	Honestly, it's not too difficult, and the tasks they have you do are pretty simple for the most part. If you know React, and you certainly know Java, you'll be fine imo [:+1:1] 
2018-01-03 09:48:21	jkayani	But yeah they could've done a better job explaining some of this in the course - wait until you get to Selenium and Cucumber, that's where I was confused for a while 
2018-01-03 09:51:52	jesse	yeah. they had webpages to explain those tools, but they would just explain that 
2018-01-03 09:51:52		hibernate --> object relational mapping
2018-01-03 09:51:52		its difficult for a newbie such as myself to understand what that means. at least, thats what annoyed me with coffeemaker 
2018-01-03 09:53:14	carl	"we made this hard so you'll never get to experience good software engineering" 
2018-01-03 09:53:51	jesse	xD what's good software engineering? 
2018-01-04 12:54:46	mrgray4	An oxymoron 
2018-01-04 12:55:15	mrgray4	We made it to another semester (I reset my computer pre-break and forgot to reinstall slack) 
2018-01-04 12:55:17	mrgray4	! 
2018-01-04 12:56:53	jesse	welcome back [:heart:1] 
2018-01-07 15:16:51	jkayani	What's the new Slack name going to be? Since most of us are done w. the required classes now 
2018-01-07 15:17:17	mrgray4	I was thinking about this the other day, but Heckman is still somewhat relevant to everyone, so I didn't change it yet 
2018-01-07 15:17:17	jkayani	save for senior design 
2018-01-07 15:17:21	mrgray4	Gladly taking ideas 
2018-01-07 15:17:32	mrgray4	I think @nmcroutw is the only senior designer this semester AFAIK 
2018-01-07 15:21:35	carl	When is everyone else taking senior design? 
2018-01-07 15:22:20	jkayani	Fall 2018 
2018-01-07 15:22:28	jkayani	tenatively 
2018-01-07 15:22:41	mrgray4	Same, not too tentatively because that's gradgitation time I think 
2018-01-07 15:23:03	jkayani	Yeah I'm on track to be done then, but in case this semester goes down the gutter 
2018-01-07 15:55:21	jesse	same. But I dont get the luxury of a gutter. :) 
2018-01-07 16:11:18	carl	Neat. I'm planning on taking it Spring 2019. Are y'all graduating in the Fall? [:fallen_leaf:1] 
2018-01-07 16:59:00	jesse	yeah. usually you have to take senior design last semester. 
2018-01-08 15:10:37	mrgray4	hypothetical, if you have a syllabus on git and you find a typo do you submit a PR 
2018-01-08 15:10:46	mrgray4	:thinking_face: 
2018-01-08 15:31:30	jesse	please tell me this happened to ya 
2018-01-08 15:31:59	mrgray4	I've thought about submitting the PR but I don't want to because it's just ". he" instead of ". the"

2018-02-16 10:02:46	mrgray4	Good news everyone! New emojis available: :party_parrot: :fast_party_parrot: :fidget: 
2018-03-14 11:26:01	mrgray4	What is everyone taking next semester? I was looking at CSC440, but the rate my professor reviews are some of the worst I've seen :! 
2018-03-14 11:48:06	jkayani	Yeah we were all thinking 440 but alas, it's not Chirkova teaching it 
2018-03-14 11:56:58	mrgray4	She is teaching 442 though, what about that? 
2018-03-14 11:57:05	mrgray4	I'm also looking at compiler theory, a 495 
2018-03-14 13:51:27	jkayani	What's 442? 
2018-03-14 14:27:01	jesse	i was kinda hoping I could only take 495  csc electives haha. but other than software security, ill be in human computer interaction if i can get in. 
2018-03-14 14:27:26	jesse	dunno what 442 is though. 
2018-03-14 14:33:01	jesse	i also plan on taking senior design and 2 psy courses: ergonomics and whatever psy 307 is... 
2018-03-14 14:45:22	mrgray4	I think 442 is data science 
2018-03-14 14:45:29	mrgray4	It looks like a slight continuation of data structures 
2018-03-14 14:45:51	mrgray4	jeez louise jesse 
2018-03-14 14:48:29	jesse	i know, ergonomics sounds horrible. 
2018-03-18 14:14:33	mrgray4	Is mypack down for anyone else? 
2018-03-18 14:14:46	mrgray4	Tried in safari and chrome, both are fubar'd

2018-03-18 14:14:54	mrgray4	rip 
2018-03-18 14:14:54	gjabell	is broke 
2018-03-18 14:15:04	mrgray4	I want mypack to be a senior design project 
2018-03-18 14:16:28	gjabell	see, you say that... but can you imagine being given the current code and told to improve it xD 
2018-03-18 14:16:48	mrgray4	No, like from scratch. Given API specs. 
2018-03-18 14:16:51	mrgray4	Fuck the current code 
2018-03-18 14:17:04	mrgray4	Going from scratch would take a few semesters, but it'd have so many possibilities 
2018-03-18 14:20:37	gjabell	yeah

2018-03-25 12:11:11	mrgray4	Ethics forum posts are getting ridiculous - Dr. Wright is having a power trip on how many discussions there are 
2018-03-25 12:11:25	mrgray4	It went from 0 or 1 a week, to maybe 2 a week, to 3 a week 
2018-03-25 12:11:44	mrgray4	This week there are 3 forums, each with 2 posts to make in them, each with their own "RELIABLE AND VERIFIABLE" sources to find

2017-10-11 09:39:43	adyfrancis	Shit there's only one professor  
2017-10-11 09:43:22	jkayani	A D- in ethics or SE @chrisaben ? 
2017-10-11 09:43:55	jkayani	SE with Heckman is good; although tbh your instructor doesn't seem to matter as much as your TAs 
2017-10-11 09:54:24	chrisaben	Ethics :joy: haven't taken SE yet 
2017-10-11 10:27:34	carl	Last semester, they changed the time for SE. Maybe they'll do it again.  
2017-10-11 10:28:50	adyfrancis	Is it MWThu this semester?  
2017-10-11 10:30:30	carl	Yes 
2017-10-11 10:32:03	nmcroutw	CSC 495 (007) had 80% A's. Sign me up 
2017-10-11 10:33:55	chrisaben	What 495 though? 
2017-10-11 10:34:39	adyfrancis	Visual interfaces for mobile devices  
2017-10-11 10:34:59	adyfrancis	Only 30 seats though  
2017-10-11 10:35:01	carl	I need to have two CSC electives completed to do senior design, so I'm not sure if pushing it back is a good idea.  
2017-10-11 11:19:20	carl	@carl uploaded a file: https://sturgill-operators.slack.com/files/U3V2J18QG/F7GPVBJDA/image.png (image.png) and commented: r8 my schedule

2017-10-11 11:22:09	mrgray4	Your afternoons look so nice and free! 
2017-10-11 11:22:52	carl	That's the way I like it. I have class ending at 4:15 every day (M-Th) this semester and I'm not a fan. 
2017-10-11 11:27:49	carl	How many hours a week do y'all spend on CSC 326? 
2017-10-11 11:30:34	jesse	how many hours are in a week? 
2017-10-11 11:31:00	jkayani	Most of them 
2017-10-11 11:32:17	jesse	i would say i spent 40 to 50 each week on the last project. 
2017-10-11 11:32:25	carl	What is wrong this with class? :weary: 
2017-10-11 11:32:33	adyfrancis	Wtf 
2017-10-11 11:35:06	jesse	yeah. what I do, is get all my work for the other classes on one weekend day and then devote almost all my other time to software engineering. 
2017-10-11 11:35:50	carl	Someone should lead a strike. :thinking_face: 
2017-10-11 11:36:07	adyfrancis	Unionize the CSC class?? [:point_up:3] 
2017-10-11 11:38:39	carl	>  This course is based on reality, so the project will be as real-world as we can make it.... which might just mean that some aspects of the project may intentionally cause you some heartache (such as ill-defined AND/OR changing requirements). Remember, it's for your own good.
2017-10-11 11:38:39		Yeah, because every CSC grad is going to become a software engineer in industry... 
2017-10-11 11:42:24	chrisaben	I love how that is the course description though :joy: 
2017-10-11 11:46:34	adyfrancis	Is it that the projects are difficult to code? Or is it just a lot of components  
2017-10-11 11:48:01	chrisaben	I think it's just that the companies that assign them give really shitty requirements, unlike what we've been assigned in our other programming classes, and then they'll be like OH YEA WE'RE GONNA GO WITH THIS SHIT INSTEAD when you already spent several hours creating the component they originally wanted 
2017-10-11 11:49:04	mrgray4	@adyfrancis some bugs are difficult to find, but it's just a big ol pile of shit 
2017-10-11 11:49:06	mrgray4	as in a lot 
2017-10-11 11:49:22	jkayani	Delegating tasks and making sure everyone is in sync is the real challenge imo [:point_up:1] 
2017-10-11 11:49:23	carl	> the companies that assign them
2017-10-11 11:49:23		What does this mean? 
2017-10-11 11:49:37	jkayani	Especially when your team members are at different skill levels 
2017-10-11 11:50:04	jkayani	I had to hold my teammates hand the last 2 projects and it's exhausting 
2017-10-11 11:50:19	chrisaben	I heard that the projects are like company assignments? I may be thinking about senior design 
2017-10-11 11:50:37	chrisaben	Someone was describing the one of the classes in this way 
2017-10-11 11:50:48	mrgray4	Yep that's senior design 
2017-10-11 11:50:48	jkayani	Nah 326 you're multiple groups working on the same project to do the same things [:point_up:1] 
2017-10-11 11:51:06	jkayani	But it's separate code base per group 
2017-10-11 11:51:31	jkayani	So each group has an iTryst, and each group works too add the same bullshit to it 
2017-10-11 12:04:32	carl	Thinking from the perspective of The Communicative Constitution of Organization, it sounds like CSC 326 does almost everything wrong when it comes to the flow of communication. As the class seems to force organizational flexibility, I would assume that most groups never achieve an effective process of "organizational self-structuring" where they formalize their communication roles and methods. The class bypasses the "membership negotiation" communication flow by assigning random groups, which likely destroys the homogeneity of groups' goals and values. This makes it hard to define clear expectations for group members. Furthermore, this makes it even more difficult to be effective in the communication flow of "activity coordination" because members have little way of knowing the abilities and preferences of other group members. I would assume that there are also problems in "institutional positioning" because group assignments typically have one point of contact between the organization (the student group) and their publics (the teaching staff). This makes it challenging for the teaching staff to address imbalances in power and passion which is likely the driving force for decision-making in these groups. 
2017-10-11 12:05:00	carl	tl;dr not looking forward to this class at all 
2017-10-11 12:06:19	jkayani	You do get to pick your groups on the last, biggest project 
2017-10-11 12:06:42	carl	Based on this, the notion that the course is in any way reflective of the "real world" is folly because the communicative constitution of the student groups is fundamentally different from the communicative constitution of professional software development teams.  (edited)
2017-10-11 12:07:31	jkayani	And yeah there is 1 point of contact, but he's like a God in that he almost always has a solution and dedicates his life to this class [:point_up:1] 
2017-10-11 17:27:17	nmcroutw	Are any of you interning/working part time along with school? If so how many hours? I'm trying to decide if working 20 hours would be too much with classes 
2017-10-11 17:28:41	jesse	not me.  
2017-10-11 17:29:08	jkayani	I wouldn't do it 
2017-10-11 17:29:20	jkayani	For me anyway, with 326, hell no 
2017-10-11 17:29:24	carl	I'm working a few jobs currently. 20 hours definitely sounds like too much.  
2017-10-11 19:53:06	mrgray4	I like school and classes separate. Got offered for channeladvisor but turned it down for that reason. If you can go part time then maybe consider that if you?re not getting financial aid. Personally I?d say no 
2017-10-11 19:53:59	jesse	what is school without classes? :) 
2017-10-11 19:56:49	mbbennis	I'm doing 20 hours now, but I'm only in 11 hours of classes. I usually end up clocking a few hours under and I'm somehow less busy now than I have been in some full time semesters 
2017-10-11 19:57:06	mbbennis	But idk, it probably depends on the job 
2017-10-12 09:41:40	mrgray4	@mrgray4 uploaded a file: https://sturgill-operators.slack.com/files/U3WBH0F7G/F7GPV4MEV/screen_shot_2017-10-12_at_9.40.42_am.png (Screen Shot 2017-10-12 at 9.40.42 AM.png) and commented: Schedule ?\_(?)_/? .

2017-10-12 10:21:44	jesse	theres ours... but most of it is the same. 
2017-10-12 10:29:33	jesse	was the 'types of problems' what kowolenko talked about during the review day? 
2017-10-12 10:30:00	jesse	i was there but I didnt take notes on that. 
2017-10-12 10:30:07	adyfrancis	It was a part of the paper 
2017-10-12 10:30:38	adyfrancis	According to friends of my group mates who have taken the class before he asked "name 5 problems and give examples of each" 
2017-10-12 10:31:55	jesse	i dont recall us getting any paper. but I'll try to remember the ones in your sheet 
2017-10-12 10:32:22	adyfrancis	We were told to read a paper about types of problems  
2017-10-12 10:32:55	jesse	oh yeahhhh...  those readings  
2017-10-12 10:33:50	jesse	i didn't read them so that explains why it looked new 
2017-10-12 11:15:16	mrgray4	Hey I read that thing! I did a thing for once! [:+1::skin-tone-3:1] 
2017-10-16 10:03:53	nmcroutw	Is anyone in 401? How is it? 
2017-10-16 10:38:31	jkayani	Yeah 
2017-10-16 10:38:44	jkayani	It's alright - it can be a bit dry at times, b/c it's a lot of digging into protcols 
2017-10-17 10:11:19	adyfrancis	495 pals what are we supposed to talk about today? Something about data? 
2017-10-17 10:18:17	nmcroutw	We are presenting our databases. I wrote down we need to talk about schema, primary keys, and address formatting issues but idk exactly what all those are 
2017-10-17 10:19:03	adyfrancis	Yeah I wrote where I sourced data and primary keys for structured data but I was forgetting about the schema for unstructured  
2017-10-17 10:19:06	adyfrancis	Thanks! 
2017-10-19 15:37:21	mrgray4	Folks, I got the WillowTree internship!!! [:smile:3] 
2017-10-19 15:37:49	mrgray4	My recruiter had resigned leaving me in internship limbo, but I got through today and found out I have an offer :D 
2017-10-19 16:22:56	jesse	was the internship for a position as a recruiter? xD [:goshjosh:1] 
2017-10-19 16:23:07	jesse	congrats dude [:heart:1] 
2017-10-19 16:33:19	mrgray4	Yes, want an internship? 
2017-10-19 16:40:12	carl	:raising_hand: 
2017-10-19 16:43:26	mrgray4	Apply! For anyone interested, they really look positively on people who've done projects, ESPECIALLY mobile applications 
2017-11-29 10:13:26	jesse	Hey guys, one of my buddys might be getting a D in ethics and we were wondering if he would need to retake the course or not. Does anyone know? 
2017-11-29 10:17:08	carl	I don't think it's a prerequisite for anything, so I doubt it's C-walled.  
2017-11-29 10:20:43	jesse	true, but I thought there mightve been a rule about all CSC courses need to be C- or better... idk know and idk if it applies to 1 credit hour courses. 
2017-11-29 11:02:06	chrisaben	It's not c wall, I got a D- and it's checked off 
2017-11-29 11:14:40	jesse	nice. ill let my friend know. thanks. 
2017-12-21 21:38:59	carl	What is the general tech stack being used in Software Engineering these days? Would it be worth it to read up on some entry-level documentation for anything beforehand? 
2017-12-21 21:40:53	jesse	Java, and AngularJS are the big ones. The rest you can learn as you go. Selenium would help too. 
2017-12-21 21:41:32	carl	Angular 1 or Angular 2? 
2017-12-21 21:41:38	jesse	1 
2017-12-21 21:46:26	jesse	if i were you, i would get the iTrust2 project from github and learn what angularjs and selenium does and what functions/syntax to use. 
2017-12-21 21:47:15	jesse	https://github.ncsu.edu/engr-csc326-staff/iTrust-v23
2017-12-21 21:47:15		Build software better, together
2017-12-21 21:47:15		GitHub is where people build software. More than 15 million people use GitHub to discover, fork, and contribute to over 38 million projects. 
2017-12-21 21:51:08	carl	Thanks! It seems I know exactly the wrong frontend tools for this class (React+Jest and a smattering of whatever was trendy in 2015). I've heard of Selenium and Java, though. :thinking_face: 
2017-12-21 22:06:41	jesse	i think the biggest problem i had was I didnt even know what angular did or what selenium did. Nobody told us what any of that means and they threw in a bunch of fancy terms like Spring, and Hibernate as if they were relevant. 
2017-12-21 22:06:41		If you know that Angular is a tool to link up the HTML view with javascript variables, and you know how to make get and post requests (and what those mean), youll be fine.
2017-12-21 22:06:41		Selenium is for automated testing using a headless browser. sometimes it works, sometimes it doesnt. if it doesnt work, make your program wait for a few seconds after fetching a new page and try again.
2017-12-21 22:06:41		As for hibernate and spring, simple copy and paste of code elsewhere in itrust will do everything you could possibly ever want.  (edited)
2017-12-21 22:17:52	carl	I've never even heard of Spring or Hibernate. Thanks! 
2018-01-03 09:45:33	jkayani	Spring's just the Java framework they use for organizing the back end 
2018-01-03 09:46:03	jkayani	And Hibernate's an ORM (Object Relational Mapping? idk) that turns DB entities into Java objects (and vice versa) for easy manipulation in your backend [:+1::skin-tone-2:1] 
2018-01-03 09:47:06	jkayani	Honestly, it's not too difficult, and the tasks they have you do are pretty simple for the most part. If you know React, and you certainly know Java, you'll be fine imo [:+1:1] 
2018-01-03 09:48:21	jkayani	But yeah they could've done a better job explaining some of this in the course - wait until you get to Selenium and Cucumber, that's where I was confused for a while 
2018-01-03 09:51:52	jesse	yeah. they had webpages to explain those tools, but they would just explain that 
2018-01-03 09:51:52		hibernate --> object relational mapping
2018-01-03 09:51:52		its difficult for a newbie such as myself to understand what that means. at least, thats what annoyed me with coffeemaker 
2018-01-03 09:53:14	carl	"we made this hard so you'll never get to experience good software engineering" 
2018-01-03 09:53:51	jesse	xD what's good software engineering? 
2018-01-04 12:54:46	mrgray4	An oxymoron 
2018-01-04 12:55:15	mrgray4	We made it to another semester (I reset my computer pre-break and forgot to reinstall slack) 
2018-01-04 12:55:17	mrgray4	! 
2018-01-04 12:56:53	jesse	welcome back [:heart:1] 
2018-01-07 15:16:51	jkayani	What's the new Slack name going to be? Since most of us are done w. the required classes now 
2018-01-07 15:17:17	mrgray4	I was thinking about this the other day, but Heckman is still somewhat relevant to everyone, so I didn't change it yet 
2018-01-07 15:17:17	jkayani	save for senior design 
2018-01-07 15:17:21	mrgray4	Gladly taking ideas 
2018-01-07 15:17:32	mrgray4	I think @nmcroutw is the only senior designer this semester AFAIK 
2018-01-07 15:21:35	carl	When is everyone else taking senior design? 
2018-01-07 15:22:20	jkayani	Fall 2018 
2018-01-07 15:22:28	jkayani	tenatively 
2018-01-07 15:22:41	mrgray4	Same, not too tentatively because that's gradgitation time I think 
2018-01-07 15:23:03	jkayani	Yeah I'm on track to be done then, but in case this semester goes down the gutter 
2018-01-07 15:55:21	jesse	same. But I dont get the luxury of a gutter. :) 
2018-01-07 16:11:18	carl	Neat. I'm planning on taking it Spring 2019. Are y'all graduating in the Fall? [:fallen_leaf:1] 
2018-01-07 16:59:00	jesse	yeah. usually you have to take senior design last semester. 
2018-01-08 15:10:37	mrgray4	hypothetical, if you have a syllabus on git and you find a typo do you submit a PR 
2018-01-08 15:10:46	mrgray4	:thinking_face: 
2018-01-08 15:31:30	jesse	please tell me this happened to ya 
2018-01-08 15:31:59	mrgray4	I've thought about submitting the PR but I don't want to because it's just ". he" instead of ". the" 
2018-01-08 15:32:46	jesse	do it. for no other reason than you can xD 
2018-01-08 15:47:13	nmcroutw	That would be a pretty savage fdoc move

2018-03-14 11:26:01	mrgray4	What is everyone taking next semester? I was looking at CSC440, but the rate my professor reviews are some of the worst I've seen :! 
2018-03-14 11:48:06	jkayani	Yeah we were all thinking 440 but alas, it's not Chirkova teaching it 
2018-03-14 11:56:58	mrgray4	She is teaching 442 though, what about that? 
2018-03-14 11:57:05	mrgray4	I'm also looking at compiler theory, a 495 
2018-03-14 13:51:27	jkayani	What's 442? 
2018-03-14 14:27:01	jesse	i was kinda hoping I could only take 495  csc electives haha. but other than software security, ill be in human computer interaction if i can get in. 
2018-03-14 14:27:26	jesse	dunno what 442 is though. 
2018-03-14 14:33:01	jesse	i also plan on taking senior design and 2 psy courses: ergonomics and whatever psy 307 is... 
2018-03-14 14:45:22	mrgray4	I think 442 is data science 
2018-03-14 14:45:29	mrgray4	It looks like a slight continuation of data structures 
2018-03-14 14:45:51	mrgray4	jeez louise jesse 
2018-03-14 14:48:29	jesse	i know, ergonomics sounds horrible. 
2018-03-18 14:14:33	mrgray4	Is mypack down for anyone else? 
2018-03-18 14:14:46	mrgray4	Tried in safari and chrome, both are fubar'd

2018-03-18 14:15:04	mrgray4	I want mypack to be a senior design project 
2018-03-18 14:16:28	gjabell	see, you say that... but can you imagine being given the current code and told to improve it xD 
2018-03-18 14:16:48	mrgray4	No, like from scratch. Given API specs. 
2018-03-18 14:16:51	mrgray4	Fuck the current code 
2018-03-18 14:17:04	mrgray4	Going from scratch would take a few semesters, but it'd have so many possibilities 
2018-03-18 14:20:37	gjabell	yeah

2018-03-25 12:11:25	mrgray4	It went from 0 or 1 a week, to maybe 2 a week, to 3 a week 
2018-03-25 12:11:44	mrgray4	This week there are 3 forums, each with 2 posts to make in them, each with their own "RELIABLE AND VERIFIABLE" sources to find

2017-10-11 09:39:43	adyfrancis	Shit there's only one professor  
2017-10-11 09:43:22	jkayani	A D- in ethics or SE @chrisaben ? 
2017-10-11 09:43:55	jkayani	SE with Heckman is good; although tbh your instructor doesn't seem to matter as much as your TAs 
2017-10-11 09:54:24	chrisaben	Ethics :joy: haven't taken SE yet 
2017-10-11 10:27:34	carl	Last semester, they changed the time for SE. Maybe they'll do it again.  
2017-10-11 10:28:50	adyfrancis	Is it MWThu this semester?  
2017-10-11 10:30:30	carl	Yes 
2017-10-11 10:32:03	nmcroutw	CSC 495 (007) had 80% A's. Sign me up 
2017-10-11 10:33:55	chrisaben	What 495 though? 
2017-10-11 10:34:39	adyfrancis	Visual interfaces for mobile devices  
2017-10-11 10:34:59	adyfrancis	Only 30 seats though  
2017-10-11 10:35:01	carl	I need to have two CSC electives completed to do senior design, so I'm not sure if pushing it back is a good idea.

2017-10-11 11:22:52	carl	That's the way I like it. I have class ending at 4:15 every day (M-Th) this semester and I'm not a fan. 
2017-10-11 11:27:49	carl	How many hours a week do y'all spend on CSC 326? 
2017-10-11 11:30:34	jesse	how many hours are in a week? 
2017-10-11 11:31:00	jkayani	Most of them 
2017-10-11 11:32:17	jesse	i would say i spent 40 to 50 each week on the last project. 
2017-10-11 11:32:25	carl	What is wrong this with class? :weary: 
2017-10-11 11:32:33	adyfrancis	Wtf 
2017-10-11 11:35:06	jesse	yeah. what I do, is get all my work for the other classes on one weekend day and then devote almost all my other time to software engineering. 
2017-10-11 11:35:50	carl	Someone should lead a strike. :thinking_face: 
2017-10-11 11:36:07	adyfrancis	Unionize the CSC class?? [:point_up:3] 
2017-10-11 11:38:39	carl	>  This course is based on reality, so the project will be as real-world as we can make it.... which might just mean that some aspects of the project may intentionally cause you some heartache (such as ill-defined AND/OR changing requirements). Remember, it's for your own good.
2017-10-11 11:38:39		Yeah, because every CSC grad is going to become a software engineer in industry... 
2017-10-11 11:42:24	chrisaben	I love how that is the course description though :joy: 
2017-10-11 11:46:34	adyfrancis	Is it that the projects are difficult to code? Or is it just a lot of components  
2017-10-11 11:48:01	chrisaben	I think it's just that the companies that assign them give really shitty requirements, unlike what we've been assigned in our other programming classes, and then they'll be like OH YEA WE'RE GONNA GO WITH THIS SHIT INSTEAD when you already spent several hours creating the component they originally wanted 
2017-10-11 11:49:04	mrgray4	@adyfrancis some bugs are difficult to find, but it's just a big ol pile of shit 
2017-10-11 11:49:06	mrgray4	as in a lot 
2017-10-11 11:49:22	jkayani	Delegating tasks and making sure everyone is in sync is the real challenge imo [:point_up:1] 
2017-10-11 11:49:23	carl	> the companies that assign them
2017-10-11 11:49:23		What does this mean? 
2017-10-11 11:49:37	jkayani	Especially when your team members are at different skill levels 
2017-10-11 11:50:04	jkayani	I had to hold my teammates hand the last 2 projects and it's exhausting 
2017-10-11 11:50:19	chrisaben	I heard that the projects are like company assignments? I may be thinking about senior design 
2017-10-11 11:50:37	chrisaben	Someone was describing the one of the classes in this way 
2017-10-11 11:50:48	mrgray4	Yep that's senior design 
2017-10-11 11:50:48	jkayani	Nah 326 you're multiple groups working on the same project to do the same things [:point_up:1] 
2017-10-11 11:51:06	jkayani	But it's separate code base per group 
2017-10-11 11:51:31	jkayani	So each group has an iTryst, and each group works too add the same bullshit to it 
2017-10-11 12:04:32	carl	Thinking from the perspective of The Communicative Constitution of Organization, it sounds like CSC 326 does almost everything wrong when it comes to the flow of communication. As the class seems to force organizational flexibility, I would assume that most groups never achieve an effective process of "organizational self-structuring" where they formalize their communication roles and methods. The class bypasses the "membership negotiation" communication flow by assigning random groups, which likely destroys the homogeneity of groups' goals and values. This makes it hard to define clear expectations for group members. Furthermore, this makes it even more difficult to be effective in the communication flow of "activity coordination" because members have little way of knowing the abilities and preferences of other group members. I would assume that there are also problems in "institutional positioning" because group assignments typically have one point of contact between the organization (the student group) and their publics (the teaching staff). This makes it challenging for the teaching staff to address imbalances in power and passion which is likely the driving force for decision-making in these groups. 
2017-10-11 12:05:00	carl	tl;dr not looking forward to this class at all 
2017-10-11 12:06:19	jkayani	You do get to pick your groups on the last, biggest project 
2017-10-11 12:06:42	carl	Based on this, the notion that the course is in any way reflective of the "real world" is folly because the communicative constitution of the student groups is fundamentally different from the communicative constitution of professional software development teams.  (edited)
2017-10-11 12:07:31	jkayani	And yeah there is 1 point of contact, but he's like a God in that he almost always has a solution and dedicates his life to this class [:point_up:1] 
2017-10-11 17:27:17	nmcroutw	Are any of you interning/working part time along with school? If so how many hours? I'm trying to decide if working 20 hours would be too much with classes 
2017-10-11 17:28:41	jesse	not me.  
2017-10-11 17:29:08	jkayani	I wouldn't do it 
2017-10-11 17:29:20	jkayani	For me anyway, with 326, hell no 
2017-10-11 17:29:24	carl	I'm working a few jobs currently. 20 hours definitely sounds like too much.  
2017-10-11 19:53:06	mrgray4	I like school and classes separate. Got offered for channeladvisor but turned it down for that reason. If you can go part time then maybe consider that if you?re not getting financial aid. Personally I?d say no 
2017-10-11 19:53:59	jesse	what is school without classes? :) 
2017-10-11 19:56:49	mbbennis	I'm doing 20 hours now, but I'm only in 11 hours of classes. I usually end up clocking a few hours under and I'm somehow less busy now than I have been in some full time semesters 
2017-10-11 19:57:06	mbbennis	But idk, it probably depends on the job

2017-10-12 10:21:44	jesse	theres ours... but most of it is the same. 
2017-10-12 10:29:33	jesse	was the 'types of problems' what kowolenko talked about during the review day? 
2017-10-12 10:30:00	jesse	i was there but I didnt take notes on that. 
2017-10-12 10:30:07	adyfrancis	It was a part of the paper 
2017-10-12 10:30:38	adyfrancis	According to friends of my group mates who have taken the class before he asked "name 5 problems and give examples of each" 
2017-10-12 10:31:55	jesse	i dont recall us getting any paper. but I'll try to remember the ones in your sheet 
2017-10-12 10:32:22	adyfrancis	We were told to read a paper about types of problems  
2017-10-12 10:32:55	jesse	oh yeahhhh...  those readings  
2017-10-12 10:33:50	jesse	i didn't read them so that explains why it looked new 
2017-10-12 11:15:16	mrgray4	Hey I read that thing! I did a thing for once! [:+1::skin-tone-3:1] 
2017-10-16 10:03:53	nmcroutw	Is anyone in 401? How is it? 
2017-10-16 10:38:31	jkayani	Yeah 
2017-10-16 10:38:44	jkayani	It's alright - it can be a bit dry at times, b/c it's a lot of digging into protcols 
2017-10-17 10:11:19	adyfrancis	495 pals what are we supposed to talk about today? Something about data? 
2017-10-17 10:18:17	nmcroutw	We are presenting our databases. I wrote down we need to talk about schema, primary keys, and address formatting issues but idk exactly what all those are 
2017-10-17 10:19:03	adyfrancis	Yeah I wrote where I sourced data and primary keys for structured data but I was forgetting about the schema for unstructured  
2017-10-17 10:19:06	adyfrancis	Thanks! 
2017-10-19 15:37:21	mrgray4	Folks, I got the WillowTree internship!!! [:smile:3] 
2017-10-19 15:37:49	mrgray4	My recruiter had resigned leaving me in internship limbo, but I got through today and found out I have an offer :D 
2017-10-19 16:22:56	jesse	was the internship for a position as a recruiter? xD [:goshjosh:1] 
2017-10-19 16:23:07	jesse	congrats dude [:heart:1] 
2017-10-19 16:33:19	mrgray4	Yes, want an internship? 
2017-10-19 16:40:12	carl	:raising_hand: 
2017-10-19 16:43:26	mrgray4	Apply! For anyone interested, they really look positively on people who've done projects, ESPECIALLY mobile applications 
2017-11-29 10:13:26	jesse	Hey guys, one of my buddys might be getting a D in ethics and we were wondering if he would need to retake the course or not. Does anyone know? 
2017-11-29 10:17:08	carl	I don't think it's a prerequisite for anything, so I doubt it's C-walled.  
2017-11-29 10:20:43	jesse	true, but I thought there mightve been a rule about all CSC courses need to be C- or better... idk know and idk if it applies to 1 credit hour courses. 
2017-11-29 11:02:06	chrisaben	It's not c wall, I got a D- and it's checked off 
2017-11-29 11:14:40	jesse	nice. ill let my friend know. thanks. 
2017-12-21 21:38:59	carl	What is the general tech stack being used in Software Engineering these days? Would it be worth it to read up on some entry-level documentation for anything beforehand? 
2017-12-21 21:40:53	jesse	Java, and AngularJS are the big ones. The rest you can learn as you go. Selenium would help too. 
2017-12-21 21:41:32	carl	Angular 1 or Angular 2? 
2017-12-21 21:41:38	jesse	1 
2017-12-21 21:46:26	jesse	if i were you, i would get the iTrust2 project from github and learn what angularjs and selenium does and what functions/syntax to use. 
2017-12-21 21:47:15	jesse	https://github.ncsu.edu/engr-csc326-staff/iTrust-v23
2017-12-21 21:47:15		Build software better, together
2017-12-21 21:47:15		GitHub is where people build software. More than 15 million people use GitHub to discover, fork, and contribute to over 38 million projects. 
2017-12-21 21:51:08	carl	Thanks! It seems I know exactly the wrong frontend tools for this class (React+Jest and a smattering of whatever was trendy in 2015). I've heard of Selenium and Java, though. :thinking_face: 
2017-12-21 22:06:41	jesse	i think the biggest problem i had was I didnt even know what angular did or what selenium did. Nobody told us what any of that means and they threw in a bunch of fancy terms like Spring, and Hibernate as if they were relevant. 
2017-12-21 22:06:41		If you know that Angular is a tool to link up the HTML view with javascript variables, and you know how to make get and post requests (and what those mean), youll be fine.
2017-12-21 22:06:41		Selenium is for automated testing using a headless browser. sometimes it works, sometimes it doesnt. if it doesnt work, make your program wait for a few seconds after fetching a new page and try again.
2017-12-21 22:06:41		As for hibernate and spring, simple copy and paste of code elsewhere in itrust will do everything you could possibly ever want.  (edited)
2017-12-21 22:17:52	carl	I've never even heard of Spring or Hibernate. Thanks! 
2018-01-03 09:45:33	jkayani	Spring's just the Java framework they use for organizing the back end 
2018-01-03 09:46:03	jkayani	And Hibernate's an ORM (Object Relational Mapping? idk) that turns DB entities into Java objects (and vice versa) for easy manipulation in your backend [:+1::skin-tone-2:1] 
2018-01-03 09:47:06	jkayani	Honestly, it's not too difficult, and the tasks they have you do are pretty simple for the most part. If you know React, and you certainly know Java, you'll be fine imo [:+1:1] 
2018-01-03 09:48:21	jkayani	But yeah they could've done a better job explaining some of this in the course - wait until you get to Selenium and Cucumber, that's where I was confused for a while 
2018-01-03 09:51:52	jesse	yeah. they had webpages to explain those tools, but they would just explain that 
2018-01-03 09:51:52		hibernate --> object relational mapping
2018-01-03 09:51:52		its difficult for a newbie such as myself to understand what that means. at least, thats what annoyed me with coffeemaker 
2018-01-03 09:53:14	carl	"we made this hard so you'll never get to experience good software engineering" 
2018-01-03 09:53:51	jesse	xD what's good software engineering? 
2018-01-04 12:54:46	mrgray4	An oxymoron 
2018-01-04 12:55:15	mrgray4	We made it to another semester (I reset my computer pre-break and forgot to reinstall slack) 
2018-01-04 12:55:17	mrgray4	! 
2018-01-04 12:56:53	jesse	welcome back [:heart:1] 
2018-01-07 15:16:51	jkayani	What's the new Slack name going to be? Since most of us are done w. the required classes now 
2018-01-07 15:17:17	mrgray4	I was thinking about this the other day, but Heckman is still somewhat relevant to everyone, so I didn't change it yet 
2018-01-07 15:17:17	jkayani	save for senior design 
2018-01-07 15:17:21	mrgray4	Gladly taking ideas 
2018-01-07 15:17:32	mrgray4	I think @nmcroutw is the only senior designer this semester AFAIK 
2018-01-07 15:21:35	carl	When is everyone else taking senior design? 
2018-01-07 15:22:20	jkayani	Fall 2018 
2018-01-07 15:22:28	jkayani	tenatively 
2018-01-07 15:22:41	mrgray4	Same, not too tentatively because that's gradgitation time I think 
2018-01-07 15:23:03	jkayani	Yeah I'm on track to be done then, but in case this semester goes down the gutter 
2018-01-07 15:55:21	jesse	same. But I dont get the luxury of a gutter. :) 
2018-01-07 16:11:18	carl	Neat. I'm planning on taking it Spring 2019. Are y'all graduating in the Fall? [:fallen_leaf:1] 
2018-01-07 16:59:00	jesse	yeah. usually you have to take senior design last semester. 
2018-01-08 15:10:37	mrgray4	hypothetical, if you have a syllabus on git and you find a typo do you submit a PR 
2018-01-08 15:10:46	mrgray4	:thinking_face: 
2018-01-08 15:31:30	jesse	please tell me this happened to ya 
2018-01-08 15:31:59	mrgray4	I've thought about submitting the PR but I don't want to because it's just ". he" instead of ". the" 
2018-01-08 15:32:46	jesse	do it. for no other reason than you can xD 
2018-01-08 15:47:13	nmcroutw	That would be a pretty savage fdoc move

2018-03-14 11:26:01	mrgray4	What is everyone taking next semester? I was looking at CSC440, but the rate my professor reviews are some of the worst I've seen :! 
2018-03-14 11:48:06	jkayani	Yeah we were all thinking 440 but alas, it's not Chirkova teaching it 
2018-03-14 11:56:58	mrgray4	She is teaching 442 though, what about that? 
2018-03-14 11:57:05	mrgray4	I'm also looking at compiler theory, a 495 
2018-03-14 13:51:27	jkayani	What's 442? 
2018-03-14 14:27:01	jesse	i was kinda hoping I could only take 495  csc electives haha. but other than software security, ill be in human computer interaction if i can get in. 
2018-03-14 14:27:26	jesse	dunno what 442 is though. 
2018-03-14 14:33:01	jesse	i also plan on taking senior design and 2 psy courses: ergonomics and whatever psy 307 is... 
2018-03-14 14:45:22	mrgray4	I think 442 is data science 
2018-03-14 14:45:29	mrgray4	It looks like a slight continuation of data structures 
2018-03-14 14:45:51	mrgray4	jeez louise jesse 
2018-03-14 14:48:29	jesse	i know, ergonomics sounds horrible. 
2018-03-18 14:14:33	mrgray4	Is mypack down for anyone else? 
2018-03-18 14:14:46	mrgray4	Tried in safari and chrome, both are fubar'd

2018-03-18 14:15:04	mrgray4	I want mypack to be a senior design project 
2018-03-18 14:16:28	gjabell	see, you say that... but can you imagine being given the current code and told to improve it xD 
2018-03-18 14:16:48	mrgray4	No, like from scratch. Given API specs. 
2018-03-18 14:16:51	mrgray4	Fuck the current code 
2018-03-18 14:17:04	mrgray4	Going from scratch would take a few semesters, but it'd have so many possibilities 
2018-03-18 14:20:37	gjabell	yeah

2018-03-25 12:11:44	mrgray4	This week there are 3 forums, each with 2 posts to make in them, each with their own "RELIABLE AND VERIFIABLE" sources to find

2018-03-27 17:20:22	mrgray4	i added the things to make it easier 
2018-04-23 22:57:43		getting channel history...
2017-10-11 11:50:37	chrisaben	Someone was describing the one of the classes in this way 
2017-10-11 11:50:48	mrgray4	Yep that's senior design 
2017-10-11 11:50:48	jkayani	Nah 326 you're multiple groups working on the same project to do the same things [:point_up:1] 
2017-10-11 11:51:06	jkayani	But it's separate code base per group 
2017-10-11 11:51:31	jkayani	So each group has an iTryst, and each group works too add the same bullshit to it 
2017-10-11 12:04:32	carl	Thinking from the perspective of The Communicative Constitution of Organization, it sounds like CSC 326 does almost everything wrong when it comes to the flow of communication. As the class seems to force organizational flexibility, I would assume that most groups never achieve an effective process of "organizational self-structuring" where they formalize their communication roles and methods. The class bypasses the "membership negotiation" communication flow by assigning random groups, which likely destroys the homogeneity of groups' goals and values. This makes it hard to define clear expectations for group members. Furthermore, this makes it even more difficult to be effective in the communication flow of "activity coordination" because members have little way of knowing the abilities and preferences of other group members. I would assume that there are also problems in "institutional positioning" because group assignments typically have one point of contact between the organization (the student group) and their publics (the teaching staff). This makes it challenging for the teaching staff to address imbalances in power and passion which is likely the driving force for decision-making in these groups. 
2017-10-11 12:05:00	carl	tl;dr not looking forward to this class at all 
2017-10-11 12:06:19	jkayani	You do get to pick your groups on the last, biggest project 
2017-10-11 12:06:42	carl	Based on this, the notion that the course is in any way reflective of the "real world" is folly because the communicative constitution of the student groups is fundamentally different from the communicative constitution of professional software development teams.  (edited)
2017-10-11 12:07:31	jkayani	And yeah there is 1 point of contact, but he's like a God in that he almost always has a solution and dedicates his life to this class [:point_up:1] 
2017-10-11 17:27:17	nmcroutw	Are any of you interning/working part time along with school? If so how many hours? I'm trying to decide if working 20 hours would be too much with classes 
2017-10-11 17:28:41	jesse	not me.  
2017-10-11 17:29:08	jkayani	I wouldn't do it 
2017-10-11 17:29:20	jkayani	For me anyway, with 326, hell no 
2017-10-11 17:29:24	carl	I'm working a few jobs currently. 20 hours definitely sounds like too much.  
2017-10-11 19:53:06	mrgray4	I like school and classes separate. Got offered for channeladvisor but turned it down for that reason. If you can go part time then maybe consider that if you?re not getting financial aid. Personally I?d say no 
2017-10-11 19:53:59	jesse	what is school without classes? :) 
2017-10-11 19:56:49	mbbennis	I'm doing 20 hours now, but I'm only in 11 hours of classes. I usually end up clocking a few hours under and I'm somehow less busy now than I have been in some full time semesters 
2017-10-11 19:57:06	mbbennis	But idk, it probably depends on the job

2017-10-12 10:21:31	jesse	https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zEXElVJmPOV43AYAhHemp-UzrxOMfh2khvpZM4VallA/edit?usp=drivesdk 
2017-10-12 10:21:44	jesse	theres ours... but most of it is the same. 
2017-10-12 10:29:33	jesse	was the 'types of problems' what kowolenko talked about during the review day? 
2017-10-12 10:30:00	jesse	i was there but I didnt take notes on that. 
2017-10-12 10:30:07	adyfrancis	It was a part of the paper 
2017-10-12 10:30:38	adyfrancis	According to friends of my group mates who have taken the class before he asked "name 5 problems and give examples of each" 
2017-10-12 10:31:55	jesse	i dont recall us getting any paper. but I'll try to remember the ones in your sheet 
2017-10-12 10:32:22	adyfrancis	We were told to read a paper about types of problems  
2017-10-12 10:32:55	jesse	oh yeahhhh...  those readings  
2017-10-12 10:33:50	jesse	i didn't read them so that explains why it looked new 
2017-10-12 11:15:16	mrgray4	Hey I read that thing! I did a thing for once! [:+1::skin-tone-3:1] 
2017-10-16 10:03:53	nmcroutw	Is anyone in 401? How is it? 
2017-10-16 10:38:31	jkayani	Yeah 
2017-10-16 10:38:44	jkayani	It's alright - it can be a bit dry at times, b/c it's a lot of digging into protcols 
2017-10-17 10:11:19	adyfrancis	495 pals what are we supposed to talk about today? Something about data? 
2017-10-17 10:18:17	nmcroutw	We are presenting our databases. I wrote down we need to talk about schema, primary keys, and address formatting issues but idk exactly what all those are 
2017-10-17 10:19:03	adyfrancis	Yeah I wrote where I sourced data and primary keys for structured data but I was forgetting about the schema for unstructured  
2017-10-17 10:19:06	adyfrancis	Thanks! 
2017-10-19 15:37:21	mrgray4	Folks, I got the WillowTree internship!!! [:smile:3] 
2017-10-19 15:37:49	mrgray4	My recruiter had resigned leaving me in internship limbo, but I got through today and found out I have an offer :D 
2017-10-19 16:22:56	jesse	was the internship for a position as a recruiter? xD [:goshjosh:1] 
2017-10-19 16:23:07	jesse	congrats dude [:heart:1] 
2017-10-19 16:33:19	mrgray4	Yes, want an internship? 
2017-10-19 16:40:12	carl	:raising_hand: 
2017-10-19 16:43:26	mrgray4	Apply! For anyone interested, they really look positively on people who've done projects, ESPECIALLY mobile applications 
2017-11-29 10:13:26	jesse	Hey guys, one of my buddys might be getting a D in ethics and we were wondering if he would need to retake the course or not. Does anyone know? 
2017-11-29 10:17:08	carl	I don't think it's a prerequisite for anything, so I doubt it's C-walled.  
2017-11-29 10:20:43	jesse	true, but I thought there mightve been a rule about all CSC courses need to be C- or better... idk know and idk if it applies to 1 credit hour courses. 
2017-11-29 11:02:06	chrisaben	It's not c wall, I got a D- and it's checked off 
2017-11-29 11:14:40	jesse	nice. ill let my friend know. thanks. 
2017-12-21 21:38:59	carl	What is the general tech stack being used in Software Engineering these days? Would it be worth it to read up on some entry-level documentation for anything beforehand? 
2017-12-21 21:40:53	jesse	Java, and AngularJS are the big ones. The rest you can learn as you go. Selenium would help too. 
2017-12-21 21:41:32	carl	Angular 1 or Angular 2? 
2017-12-21 21:41:38	jesse	1 
2017-12-21 21:46:26	jesse	if i were you, i would get the iTrust2 project from github and learn what angularjs and selenium does and what functions/syntax to use. 
2017-12-21 21:47:15	jesse	https://github.ncsu.edu/engr-csc326-staff/iTrust-v23
2017-12-21 21:47:15		Build software better, together
2017-12-21 21:47:15		GitHub is where people build software. More than 15 million people use GitHub to discover, fork, and contribute to over 38 million projects. 
2017-12-21 21:51:08	carl	Thanks! It seems I know exactly the wrong frontend tools for this class (React+Jest and a smattering of whatever was trendy in 2015). I've heard of Selenium and Java, though. :thinking_face: 
2017-12-21 22:06:41	jesse	i think the biggest problem i had was I didnt even know what angular did or what selenium did. Nobody told us what any of that means and they threw in a bunch of fancy terms like Spring, and Hibernate as if they were relevant. 
2017-12-21 22:06:41		If you know that Angular is a tool to link up the HTML view with javascript variables, and you know how to make get and post requests (and what those mean), youll be fine.
2017-12-21 22:06:41		Selenium is for automated testing using a headless browser. sometimes it works, sometimes it doesnt. if it doesnt work, make your program wait for a few seconds after fetching a new page and try again.
2017-12-21 22:06:41		As for hibernate and spring, simple copy and paste of code elsewhere in itrust will do everything you could possibly ever want.  (edited)
2017-12-21 22:17:52	carl	I've never even heard of Spring or Hibernate. Thanks! 
2018-01-03 09:45:33	jkayani	Spring's just the Java framework they use for organizing the back end 
2018-01-03 09:46:03	jkayani	And Hibernate's an ORM (Object Relational Mapping? idk) that turns DB entities into Java objects (and vice versa) for easy manipulation in your backend [:+1::skin-tone-2:1] 
2018-01-03 09:47:06	jkayani	Honestly, it's not too difficult, and the tasks they have you do are pretty simple for the most part. If you know React, and you certainly know Java, you'll be fine imo [:+1:1] 
2018-01-03 09:48:21	jkayani	But yeah they could've done a better job explaining some of this in the course - wait until you get to Selenium and Cucumber, that's where I was confused for a while 
2018-01-03 09:51:52	jesse	yeah. they had webpages to explain those tools, but they would just explain that 
2018-01-03 09:51:52		hibernate --> object relational mapping
2018-01-03 09:51:52		its difficult for a newbie such as myself to understand what that means. at least, thats what annoyed me with coffeemaker 
2018-01-03 09:53:14	carl	"we made this hard so you'll never get to experience good software engineering" 
2018-01-03 09:53:51	jesse	xD what's good software engineering? 
2018-01-04 12:54:46	mrgray4	An oxymoron 
2018-01-04 12:55:15	mrgray4	We made it to another semester (I reset my computer pre-break and forgot to reinstall slack) 
2018-01-04 12:55:17	mrgray4	! 
2018-01-04 12:56:53	jesse	welcome back [:heart:1] 
2018-01-07 15:16:51	jkayani	What's the new Slack name going to be? Since most of us are done w. the required classes now 
2018-01-07 15:17:17	mrgray4	I was thinking about this the other day, but Heckman is still somewhat relevant to everyone, so I didn't change it yet 
2018-01-07 15:17:17	jkayani	save for senior design 
2018-01-07 15:17:21	mrgray4	Gladly taking ideas 
2018-01-07 15:17:32	mrgray4	I think @nmcroutw is the only senior designer this semester AFAIK 
2018-01-07 15:21:35	carl	When is everyone else taking senior design? 
2018-01-07 15:22:20	jkayani	Fall 2018 
2018-01-07 15:22:28	jkayani	tenatively 
2018-01-07 15:22:41	mrgray4	Same, not too tentatively because that's gradgitation time I think 
2018-01-07 15:23:03	jkayani	Yeah I'm on track to be done then, but in case this semester goes down the gutter 
2018-01-07 15:55:21	jesse	same. But I dont get the luxury of a gutter. :) 
2018-01-07 16:11:18	carl	Neat. I'm planning on taking it Spring 2019. Are y'all graduating in the Fall? [:fallen_leaf:1] 
2018-01-07 16:59:00	jesse	yeah. usually you have to take senior design last semester. 
2018-01-08 15:10:37	mrgray4	hypothetical, if you have a syllabus on git and you find a typo do you submit a PR 
2018-01-08 15:10:46	mrgray4	:thinking_face: 
2018-01-08 15:31:30	jesse	please tell me this happened to ya 
2018-01-08 15:31:59	mrgray4	I've thought about submitting the PR but I don't want to because it's just ". he" instead of ". the" 
2018-01-08 15:32:46	jesse	do it. for no other reason than you can xD 
2018-01-08 15:47:13	nmcroutw	That would be a pretty savage fdoc move 
2018-01-08 15:54:38	mrgray4	@mrgray4 uploaded a file: https://sturgill-operators.slack.com/files/U3WBH0F7G/F8P3HGMH6/screen_shot_2018-01-08_at_3.54.22_pm.png (Screen Shot 2018-01-08 at 3.54.22 PM.png)

2018-02-16 10:02:46	mrgray4	Good news everyone! New emojis available: :party_parrot: :fast_party_parrot: :fidget: 
2018-03-14 11:26:01	mrgray4	What is everyone taking next semester? I was looking at CSC440, but the rate my professor reviews are some of the worst I've seen :! 
2018-03-14 11:48:06	jkayani	Yeah we were all thinking 440 but alas, it's not Chirkova teaching it 
2018-03-14 11:56:58	mrgray4	She is teaching 442 though, what about that? 
2018-03-14 11:57:05	mrgray4	I'm also looking at compiler theory, a 495 
2018-03-14 13:51:27	jkayani	What's 442? 
2018-03-14 14:27:01	jesse	i was kinda hoping I could only take 495  csc electives haha. but other than software security, ill be in human computer interaction if i can get in. 
2018-03-14 14:27:26	jesse	dunno what 442 is though. 
2018-03-14 14:33:01	jesse	i also plan on taking senior design and 2 psy courses: ergonomics and whatever psy 307 is... 
2018-03-14 14:45:22	mrgray4	I think 442 is data science 
2018-03-14 14:45:29	mrgray4	It looks like a slight continuation of data structures 
2018-03-14 14:45:51	mrgray4	jeez louise jesse 
2018-03-14 14:48:29	jesse	i know, ergonomics sounds horrible. 
2018-03-18 14:14:33	mrgray4	Is mypack down for anyone else? 
2018-03-18 14:14:46	mrgray4	Tried in safari and chrome, both are fubar'd 
2018-03-18 14:14:49	gjabell	yep 
2018-03-18 14:14:54	mrgray4	rip 
2018-03-18 14:14:54	gjabell	is broke 
2018-03-18 14:15:04	mrgray4	I want mypack to be a senior design project 
2018-03-18 14:16:28	gjabell	see, you say that... but can you imagine being given the current code and told to improve it xD 
2018-03-18 14:16:48	mrgray4	No, like from scratch. Given API specs. 
2018-03-18 14:16:51	mrgray4	Fuck the current code 
2018-03-18 14:17:04	mrgray4	Going from scratch would take a few semesters, but it'd have so many possibilities 
2018-03-18 14:20:37	gjabell	yeah

2018-03-22 16:09:27	gjabell	Yep 
2018-03-22 16:09:36	gjabell	I was in cloud computing lol 
2018-03-22 16:10:17	jkayani	Thought it was a hoax at first, but then Marini sent the same thing 
2018-03-22 16:10:31	gjabell	plus it isn't april first lol 
2018-03-22 16:11:03	jkayani	You'd think the university would send a text or something 
2018-03-22 16:12:41	gjabell	yeah 
2018-03-25 12:11:11	mrgray4	Ethics forum posts are getting ridiculous - Dr. Wright is having a power trip on how many discussions there are 
2018-03-25 12:11:25	mrgray4	It went from 0 or 1 a week, to maybe 2 a week, to 3 a week 
2018-03-25 12:11:44	mrgray4	This week there are 3 forums, each with 2 posts to make in them, each with their own "RELIABLE AND VERIFIABLE" sources to find 
2018-03-25 12:12:22	mrgray4	:expressionless: 
2018-03-25 12:13:44	mbbennis	I think you only have to do 1 post. If you do more than 1, your highest score is the one that counts 
2018-03-25 12:14:32	jesse	that's how it was for me. unfortunately in thought the points stacked for a few weeks. 
2018-03-25 12:14:43	jesse	I* 
2018-03-25 12:17:43	mbbennis	I double checked the rubric: https://moodle-courses1718.wolfware.ncsu.edu/mod/page/view.php?id=453393

2018-03-25 12:20:31	mrgray4	So all these weeks 
2018-03-25 12:20:38	mrgray4	Where there has been >1 forum 
2018-03-25 12:20:41	mrgray4	I've only had to do 1 
2018-03-25 12:20:49	jesse	sorry dude. 
2018-03-25 12:20:50	mrgray4	And I get no extra credit for doing more

2018-03-27 17:16:03	mrgray4	!channel do a `:blossom:` react to this message if you're doing senior design in the fall and do a `:bee:` react if you're doing it in the spring of next year [:blossom:5 :bee:2]

2018-04-23 22:16:58	mrgray4	This drama in PLM is giving me energy to get through finals 
2018-04-23 22:17:06	mrgray4	!channel  
2018-04-23 22:17:14	gjabell	god he must hate us so much 
2018-04-23 22:17:46	gjabell	although he did kind of ask for it, that last post was super passive aggressive 
2018-04-23 22:19:16	jkayani	Did he put something in the Slack? 
2018-04-23 22:19:19	jkayani	Guess I'll take a look 
2018-04-23 22:19:25	gjabell	grab some popcorn xD 
2018-04-23 22:23:58	mrgray4	Grab a fucking bucket 
2018-04-23 22:24:07	mrgray4	He hadn?t taught undergrad in a few years 
2018-04-23 22:24:12	mrgray4	Guess he never will again 
2018-04-23 22:26:09	jkayani	I want to read the text of the policy/regulation he cited for saying he was justified in doing this 
2018-04-23 22:26:37	jesse	https://policies.ncsu.edu/regulation/reg-02-20-14/ 
2018-04-23 22:26:43	jesse	you got it josh 
2018-04-23 22:26:55	gjabell	"Assignments should not have a due date during the final exam period unless the assignment constitutes a part of the final exam.  Exceptions to this policy must be approved in advance by the department head and the dean of the college involved. " 
2018-04-23 22:27:34	gjabell	really the issue is not whether he can make it due during exam week (spoiler: he can't), but whether making it due on the 10th actually gets around that rule 
2018-04-23 22:32:36	jkayani	It also says this:
2018-04-23 22:32:36		>Lab tests and semester project reports and presentations are permissible during the final week of classes.  Papers and homework may have a due date during the final week of classes only if scheduled in the syllabus. 
2018-04-23 22:32:50	jkayani	Key phrase: **only if scheduled in the syllabus** [:+1:1 :goshjosh:1] 
2018-04-23 22:32:54	gjabell	yep 
2018-04-23 22:33:00	gjabell	which it wasn't 
2018-04-23 22:33:19	gjabell	which means if we can get an admin to say that he can't make it due on the 10th then we don't have to do it lol 
2018-04-23 22:34:17	jkayani	Ah but wait this due date is during the final week of classes 
2018-04-23 22:34:26	jkayani	*isn't 
2018-04-23 22:34:32	jkayani	It's after that lol 
2018-04-23 22:34:39	jkayani	I don't think NCSU ever anticipated this happening 
2018-04-23 22:34:56	gjabell	we get to set precedent :D 
2018-04-23 22:47:44	mrgray4	Josh is now gettin funky  [:goshjosh:1] 
2018-04-23 22:48:52	jkayani	Thought I'd pour some gasonline on it 
2018-04-23 22:50:12	gjabell	hell yeah, let's go josh 
2018-04-23 22:50:19	gjabell	now all we need is the match :) 
2018-04-23 22:51:06	mrgray4	Josh. That was the best argument yet.  
2018-04-23 22:51:12	mrgray4	Good job.  
2018-04-23 22:51:24	jkayani	I was going to say something about this yesterday 
2018-04-23 22:51:30	jkayani	At least I did today 
2018-04-23 22:53:00	mrgray4	Your citations. Omg. I love you

2018-04-23 22:59:06	gjabell	xD 
2018-04-23 22:59:08	gjabell	probably lol 
2018-04-23 22:59:18	jesse	I took screenshots of all of the messages just in case hes stupid and deletes our messages. 
2018-04-23 22:59:41	gjabell	good thinking 
2018-04-23 22:59:42	jkayani	Good call - I doubt he'd stoop that low 
2018-04-23 22:59:45	jkayani	But who knows 
2018-04-23 22:59:51	gjabell	although that would pretty much push this over the edge in our favor 
2018-04-23 23:00:43	jesse	yeap. But I think now we are at 4 emails to the Dean now, and I plan on calling him tomorrow. 
2018-04-23 23:00:55	gjabell	nice 
2018-04-23 23:01:23	jkayani	Ooh I should send one: Martin-Vega or whoever, right? 
2018-04-23 23:01:37	jesse	YES PLEASE!!! 
2018-04-23 23:01:47	jesse	i'll give you his email addresses 
2018-04-23 23:02:33	jesse	louis_martin-vega@ncsu.edu   lmartinv@ncsu.edu 
2018-04-23 23:02:43	jkayani	He has 2? 
2018-04-23 23:02:45	jesse	email both cuz we don't know which on he uses. 
2018-04-23 23:02:49	jkayani	OK 
2018-04-23 23:03:08	gjabell	might have been that he was a student 
2018-04-23 23:03:08	jesse	you guys are amazing. 
2018-04-23 23:03:16	gjabell	so he has a student one and a staff one 
2018-04-23 23:05:54	jesse	in two different places each one is listed. I would just email both so he gets the message. 
2018-04-23 23:19:02	jesse	Dunno if you guys saw earlier in menzies message. He said 'Someone has been spreading misinformation about this'. he was basically already blaming me. 
2018-04-24 10:14:16	jkayani	@jkayani uploaded a file: https://sturgill-operators.slack.com/files/U3VP4JQPL/FABFMUJGG/screenshot_20180424-101344.png (Screenshot_20180424-101344.png) 
2018-04-24 10:15:03	gjabell	see the general chat of plm 
2018-04-24 10:15:18	jkayani	Yeah I saw 
2018-04-24 10:15:56	gjabell	woop woop 
2018-04-24 10:16:30	jkayani	Tbh I didn't think this would work, especially after the response to Jesse from Laurie Williams 
2018-04-24 10:16:40	gjabell	yeah I didn't either lol 
2018-04-24 10:16:58	gjabell	so now we shame him for giving in to peer pressure, right? 
2018-04-24 10:17:25	jkayani	Lol - I'm just glad he saw the issue this time 
2018-04-24 10:17:56	jesse	xD yeah its unreal. Especially with how much hate ive been getting from every other faculty member. 
2018-04-24 10:18:26	jesse	they even denied my arguments just because they didnt think others agreed with me. 
2018-04-24 10:18:41	gjabell	that's pretty screwed up 
2018-04-24 10:18:43	jkayani	Lol that's far from the truth 
2018-04-24 10:18:58	gjabell	I'm also not sure why people in chat were on menzies' side lol 
2018-04-24 10:19:04	jkayani	Right? 
2018-04-24 10:19:19	gjabell	does anyone legit want to write the essay? bc I can't imagine why they would 
2018-04-24 10:19:39	jesse	lol. "I dont pretend to know anything about ethics or policies...."
2018-04-24 10:19:39		literally... what?!?! 
2018-04-24 10:19:46	jkayani	Maybe it's like Darth Vader and the whole pray I don't alter the deal any further 
2018-04-24 10:19:57	gjabell	xD 
2018-04-24 10:20:14	gjabell	that message really pissed me off 
2018-04-24 10:20:23	jesse	if you dont know about ethics and youre graduating, this university has some serious issues. 
2018-04-24 10:20:38	gjabell	he said he decided to leave off his third point bc it came across as condescending 
2018-04-24 10:20:57	gjabell	which is funny, because adding that explanation also made it seem condescending lol 
2018-04-24 10:21:09	jkayani	Edward Gilliam is what really rubbed me the wrong way, implying that we're being whiny and lazy 
2018-04-24 10:21:10	gjabell	there was literally no reason to even have a third point there 
2018-04-24 10:21:33	gjabell	he did use 'lmao', so... 
2018-04-24 10:22:21	jkayani	I was tempted to reply with "Some people have backbone lmao" 
2018-04-24 10:22:29	gjabell	xD 
2018-04-24 10:22:35	jesse	i mean, Im sure dr. menzies still thinks we are whiny and lazy anyway. 
2018-04-24 10:23:01	gjabell	probably, but I'm pretty sure my rep with him was already tarnished, so idgaf 
2018-04-24 10:23:58	jkayani	I don't like the idea of making an enemy in the dept either (because I'm cool with a lot of them), but idc, this had to be fought 
2018-04-24 10:24:39	gjabell	I don't think I'd want him as an ally anyways 
2018-04-24 10:25:07	jkayani	Eh maybe you're right 
2018-04-24 10:25:17	gjabell	he strikes me as giving preferential treatment based on how much you suck up to him and his ideas and I don't really want that kind of treatment lol 
2018-04-24 10:25:47	jkayani	That's a very good point 
2018-04-24 10:26:00	gjabell	I mean, you can see it with the guy who already wrote the essay 
2018-04-24 10:26:15	gjabell	dude went way overboard and menzies was happy to give him extra credit 
2018-04-24 10:26:25	jesse	true... but its not just menzies i gotta look out for. Im on dr. adams bad side too, which kinda sucks cuz she shows up to  every csc event. 
2018-04-24 10:26:35	jkayani	Are you? 
2018-04-24 10:26:49	jkayani	She didn't seem to give that impression in her responses to you 
2018-04-24 10:27:06	gjabell	ultimately it's not like they can do anything to you tho 
2018-04-24 10:27:28	gjabell	ofc menzies could give us all bad grades bc of this, but if he did that we'd just take it to the dean or someone and get them repealed 
2018-04-24 10:27:37	gjabell	and after this we probably won't have to deal with him again 
2018-04-24 10:27:47	jkayani	They can't hurt you, but they're less willing to help you 
2018-04-24 10:28:22	gjabell	I don't generally go to teachers for help anyways 
2018-04-24 10:28:55	jkayani	I think for someone like Adams though, it can be a good ally to have 
2018-04-24 10:29:03	jesse	She was pretty mad in the phone call and voice mail. mostly passive aggressive, but still. 
2018-04-24 10:29:15	gjabell	that might just be how she always is tho lol 
2018-04-24 10:29:15	jkayani	Oh, didn't realize that 
2018-04-24 10:29:21	jkayani	Lol yeah maybe 
2018-04-24 10:29:46	jkayani	I'm glad the Dean actually checks his email though 
2018-04-24 10:29:53	jkayani	That's nice to know 
2018-04-24 10:29:57	gjabell	yeha 
2018-04-24 10:30:21	jesse	seriously. it took Dr. Williams 4 days to give me a copy/pasted response towards christina. 
2018-04-24 10:31:01	gjabell	there really needs to be better student-admin support 
2018-04-24 10:31:08	gjabell	the communication here is just terrible 
2018-04-24 10:31:59	chrisaben	I emailed dr. Sullivan for a letter of rec twice in the past year and she hasn't responded 
2018-04-24 10:33:32	jesse	XD yeah. the thing that gets to me is, is that theres a whole department dedicated to dealing with students who break rules... but we only have the dean and a crappy head of csc if we have a complaint about a professor. 
2018-04-24 10:34:43	gjabell	that's what you should have written about for your eng331 paper xD 
2018-04-24 10:35:41	jesse	xD. If only I had waited.

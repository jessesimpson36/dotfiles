2017-05-09 07:48:35	carl	BAE caught me sector slipping 
2017-05-09 07:49:05	jkayani	Should've been sector sparing, am I right? 
2017-05-09 07:49:12	jkayani	Man, tough crowd 
2017-05-09 09:24:21	mrgray4	HA 
2017-05-09 12:48:51	-->		@gjabell has joined the channel 
2017-05-25 21:47:56	carl	Anyone taking Parameterized Algorithms & Complexity with Sullivan? :joy: 
2017-05-25 21:48:20	chrisaben	Me 
2017-05-25 21:49:20	carl	Masochism? :thinking_face: 
2017-05-25 21:50:05	carl	Actually looks like a cool class though. :+1: 
2017-05-25 21:50:22	chrisaben	I think she's brilliant and optimization is something I'm very interested in so it makes sense for me to take her class I guess 
2017-05-25 21:50:39	chrisaben	She was one of the only teachers I like in CSC tbh  
2017-05-25 21:51:06	chrisaben	Even though it was a fucking theory course lol 
2017-05-25 21:54:17	mrgray4	Great teacher. Great slides (except those proof paragraphs). Awful workload  
2017-05-25 21:54:20	carl	Her research looks really top notch. Does she only teach the math/theory courses? 
2017-05-25 21:56:05	chrisaben	Well the parameterization course is a theory/practical, with a focus on research 
2017-05-25 21:57:07	carl	Unrelated, but I'm currently working with a distributed computing system with 25K cores and 3 PB of storage. :heart_eyes: 
2017-05-25 22:10:54	mrgray4	I really like her I just can't mentally deal with the class. Maybe? I'm honestly still so undecided on this fall 
2017-05-25 22:11:06	mrgray4	If I stay with my job (which I love) I may be a part time student 
2017-05-25 22:11:18	mrgray4	Also @carl :heart_eyes::heart_eyes::weary: 
2017-05-26 08:57:23	carl	@mrgray4 Where are you working? I remember discussing this, but those memories have been overwritten by the last three Sturgill lectures. 
2017-05-26 09:00:13	mrgray4	ChannelAdvisor! ECommerce company. They allow a company to synchronize their inventory and orders across multiple platforms like Amazon Walmart eBay etc while also offering statistics and other stuff and things 
2017-05-26 09:00:24	mrgray4	What about you? Overwritten similarly :p 
2017-05-26 09:01:36	carl	Computational Social Science REU at Notre Dame. 
2017-06-04 13:00:00	jkayani	Looking back I really like Sullivan too. She did a pretty good job running the course, answered questions promptly, and tried to be as clear as possible. Personally, I don't think I'm really interested in theory enough (or smart enough to really get something out of it lol) to take her 495, but I'm sure it'll be a good experience. [:heart:2] 
2017-06-04 13:00:19	jkayani	Even if she was the "harder" prof. for 333, I'm glad I took her. [:heart:2] 
2017-06-04 13:00:49	jkayani	Also @carl what are you using that system to study? 
2017-06-04 13:01:05	jkayani	And @mrgray4 what do you at ChannelAdvisor? Like what team are you on? 
2017-06-04 13:32:54	carl	@jkayani We are working on creating a global agent-based model at a scale of 7.6 billion people. 
2017-06-04 13:50:21	mrgray4	@jkayani so I'm on the "ChannelSync" team which deals with the synchronization component of the software (the main part of it honestly, synchronizing products and inventory between the people selling them and the markets they're selling them on) 
2017-06-04 13:52:52	mrgray4	@jkayani I'm working on making a new Redis (kinda like a key value/NoSQL storage solution if you don't already know) data provider for them to replace an existing one. It was storing their data structures very inefficiently. I'm doing it by storing a shell of a lot of the data and then storing the actual data (sometimes megabytes worth) in S3 instead of megabytes worth in one value of a key value pair 
2017-06-04 13:53:08	mrgray4	They were getting so many out of memory exceptions lol 
2017-06-04 14:08:38	jkayani	Sounds really cool @mrgray4 - kinda like what I'm doing at the Dude actually
2017-06-04 14:08:38		It turns out the company's main business is software to manage work orders for different industries, like schools and governments and stuff. With those work orders, they get a bunch of data and make pretty analytics-esque graphs and stuff, but want to squeeze more out of it. So I'm working on a "data lake" (data just flows in/out of the lake, also noSQL) where we're building a Hadoop cluster (and associated infrastructure) to squeeze more juice out of the data (not sure exactly what), and supposedly help them migrate from old legacy data repos to this new thing. 
2017-06-04 14:08:46	jkayani	@carl what does the model model? 
2017-06-04 14:17:38	mrgray4	@jkayani that sounds awesome! Can you just create fields/groups from the lake keys? Is that the out flow? 
2017-06-04 14:36:25	carl	@jkayani Currently we are using the simulator to model human migration. 
2017-06-07 13:02:59	mrgray4	Presented in a sprint review for the first time today, 2nd finished feature :100:  
2017-06-07 13:04:35	mrgray4	Also guys I want some opinions. It?s highly likely I?ll be offered to stay on during the fall. Knowing that I value my free time/gym time, my two options are: drop down to 6 or 9 hours and do this part time OR leave on amicable terms 
2017-06-07 13:04:52	mrgray4	Also depends on how much work they?d want me to do per week if I stayed on 
2017-06-07 14:26:20	carl	How much are they paying you?  How many more credits do you need to graduate? 
2017-06-07 14:42:15	mrgray4	So that?s the breakdown. 40 hours left it says? That includes the 14 I have this coming semester 
2017-06-07 14:42:45	mrgray4	Currently getting $25 an hour, but if I stayed on should I expect more? 
2017-06-07 14:42:56	mrgray4	@mrgray4 uploaded a file: https://sturgill-operators.slack.com/files/U3WBH0F7G/F5R2UK8JK/image_uploaded_from_ios.jpg (/) 
2017-06-07 14:43:30	mrgray4	If I was around 10 a semester I could graduate in 4 
2017-06-07 14:43:40	adyfrancis	Usually companies evaluate interns yearly  
2017-06-07 14:43:55	mrgray4	Hmm okay. Thanks Ady 
2017-06-07 14:44:18	adyfrancis	$25/hour is insane I would consider working during the year it's really not that bad  
2017-06-07 14:44:21	mrgray4	I?m pretty damn happy with $25, so I guess I?d be fine in that regard 
2017-06-07 14:44:26	mrgray4	Yeah^ 
2017-06-07 14:44:48	mrgray4	I really don?t want to throw away something god 
2017-06-07 14:44:50	mrgray4	Good* 
2017-06-07 14:44:55	carl	How many hours would you be working in the Fall? 
2017-06-07 14:45:21	adyfrancis	I mean you can ask them, hey can I just come back next summer they'll probably say yes if it's likely they want you in the fall as well 
2017-06-07 14:45:23	mrgray4	Don?t know. I?d expect 20 or less. Hopefully closer to 10 because software engineering 
2017-06-07 14:46:03	mrgray4	I?m going to have a 1on1 with my boss Monday and that?s when I plan to ask details about it. I know it?s early but I?m trying to get my plans lined up 
2017-06-07 14:46:40	adyfrancis	It won't be easy for sure to do school + work but it depends on how flexible they are with hours. Plus like however far it is from school 
2017-06-07 14:47:18	mrgray4	Also I think they?re pretty good about work from home. I?m guessing I?d go in once a week to catch up and then do the rest of the work from home 
2017-06-07 14:47:50	mrgray4	My coworker has done it and he?s full time, but I?m taking what he says with a grain of salt because I think he is the king of productivity 
2017-06-07 14:48:21	adyfrancis	Haha yeah working from home is hard. Especially during school cause you're gonna wanna do school work  
2017-06-07 14:49:18	adyfrancis	I do school work at work but being in an office helps me not completely dismiss my office work. Where do you work again? How far is it from campus 
2017-06-07 14:50:06	mrgray4	ChannelAdvisor. About 10 miles down wade/I40 from campus.  
2017-06-07 14:50:58	adyfrancis	Oooh that's a drive. You can try splitting your week into MWF/TuTh 
2017-06-07 14:51:19	adyfrancis	Or try for more online classes idk 
2017-06-07 14:51:39	carl	You could always quit your job and quit school. :thinking_face: 
2017-06-07 14:52:45	adyfrancis	I'll do it if Matt does it  
2017-06-07 14:53:45	mrgray4	Just dropped out in my pack 
2017-06-07 14:53:49	mrgray4	Do it 
2017-06-07 14:54:28	adyfrancis	The mad man 
2017-06-07 14:56:59	mrgray4	There?s pretty much no way to not make my schedule every day because of god damned SE 
2017-06-07 14:57:31	chrisaben	You could always not take SE :yum: 
2017-06-07 14:57:34	adyfrancis	Cause of lab, right? Try to make lab the only class that day  
2017-06-07 14:57:48	mrgray4	Also @carl specifically but anyone who likes to jam to tunes, any good music lately?  
2017-06-07 14:57:56	mrgray4	I have two other classes that day :/ 
2017-06-07 14:58:31	mrgray4	I could not... but a lot of people including one of my roommates are so I?m doing it while the resources are hella

2017-06-08 20:17:09	adyfrancis	Can anyone help me out w/ a assembly question? Taking a practice test for the first test tomorrow  
2017-06-08 20:24:17	mrgray4	We can try :D (I may not get back til later tonight) 
2017-06-08 20:25:18	adyfrancis	It's a pretty easy one I think the answer key might be wrong or I'm missing something  
2017-06-08 20:25:49	adyfrancis	@adyfrancis uploaded a file: https://sturgill-operators.slack.com/files/U3Z34UFQF/F5QG61BB3/image_uploaded_from_ios.jpg (Image uploaded from iOS) and commented: The answer is A 
2017-06-08 23:57:27	mrgray4	Sorry about the delay 
2017-06-08 23:57:45	mrgray4	So ja I?m pretty sure is unsigned jump above 
2017-06-09 00:01:53	mrgray4	1: ax=1 bx=4, init 
2017-06-09 00:01:53		2: ax=2 bx=4, add 1 to ax
2017-06-09 00:01:53		3: ax=2 bx=2, sub ax from bx
2017-06-09 00:01:53		4: ax=2 bx=2, cmp/ja (ax=bx, so a is not above b so continue)
2017-06-09 00:01:53		5: ax=3, bx=2, add 1 to ax
2017-06-09 00:01:53		6: ax=3, bx=-1 (SIGN FLAG SET HERE)
2017-06-09 00:01:53		7: sign flag set above, registers now on this jump above causing it to be below thus falls through 
2017-06-09 00:02:09	mrgray4	And as you can see ax=3 
2017-06-09 17:51:12	adyfrancis	Sorry I forgot to check this, I sent an email to the professor haha should've updated. Although he didn't explain it very well so thanks 
2017-06-17 17:14:57	jkayani	Well, guess who forgot to check their Slack! Sorry for the late response
2017-06-17 17:14:57		@mrgray4 Not sure I understand the question - afaik, the lake is intended to be able to store/manipulate structured legacy data alongside data from their other platforms. Right now, all we're doing is building a proof of concept of already existing functionality by importing legacy data into our Hadoop-powered data lake and linking it up to some BI tool. It doesn't sound super difficult at first, but getting Hadoop and co. setup and running correctly and smoothly is an ongoing battle with firewall rules and ports, and then the import from legacy data repos is being done via: legacy->CSV->data lake. The CSV creates a bottleneck b/c it has to have a lot of badly formed records purged, otherwise the data lake will be "contaminated" lol.  Our second sprint review is Tuesday, and we're aiming to be able to query the clean data lake quicker than with the current RDBMS and move on to actually integrating the BI tool with the lake. 
2017-06-17 17:14:57		Also what'd you end up deciding about school/work for the next semester or so? 
2017-06-17 18:05:56	mrgray4	@jkayani Interesting! I just read the wiki page on data lake and it made me realize "oh duh that's what it is." I hope it works out well. So I'm enjoying work more and more as it goes, and I think I'll try and stay on if the work can be minimized to part time (<= 20hrs would be great) 
2017-06-17 18:06:45	mrgray4	For the rest of the summer, my goal is to read the 900 page (not bad 900, a lot of the pages aren't dense to do code examples and a lot of spacing) swift ebook apple released. It's really well done and documents the entire language in an educational matter so I can get even better with the platform. 
2017-06-17 18:07:26	mrgray4	!channel who's taking ethics in the fall? I think I'm going to push it back to spring because I've heard it's a bitch with software engineering due to it taking time for monotonous work (what I've heard) 
2017-06-17 18:08:39	carl	Push back Software Engineering instead. :hugging_face::hugging_face::hugging_face: 
2017-06-17 18:08:50	mrgray4	I mean... I could 
2017-06-17 18:08:57	mrgray4	It's totally possible 
2017-06-17 18:09:05	mrgray4	I could try for research this fall 
2017-07-28 16:14:47	carl	@mrgray4 Congrats on completing your advising of channels! 
2017-07-29 15:15:06	mrgray4	Thank you so much. If I come back they have a prioritized spot for me. Idk if full time SE is what I wanna do but if I don?t find something I like more within the next couple of years then it?s probably where I?ll go.  
2017-07-29 15:15:23	carl	:thumbsup: 
2017-07-29 15:15:53	mrgray4	What have your thoughts been on research? 
2017-07-29 15:17:41	carl	It's pretty great! Working on submitting a paper to a conference this weekend. Going the grad school route doesn't make economic sense though so I dunno long term yet. :thinking_face: [:thinking_face:1]  (edited)

[:fire:1] 
2017-10-10 13:34:09	jkayani	Lol do they usually do the course release on the 9th? 
2017-10-10 13:36:36	jesse	its usually much earlier.. but i think that since the new mypack just opened, they didn't wanna deal with it.

2018-02-01 18:04:41	mrgray4	I live in Lakeview. I?m doing nothing either will probably just gonna work on hw tonight 
2018-02-01 18:08:17	carl	Sounds great. I'll head over.  
2018-02-01 18:33:56	mrgray4	Do you see a grassy knoll 
2018-02-01 18:34:12	mrgray4	Not the one Kennedy was around 
2018-02-02 21:28:50	jkayani	Anyone in Wolf Ride next semester looking for a roommate? B/c that's where I'm trying to go 
2018-02-02 21:29:21	jkayani	I say next semester b/c it's probably my last, so you'd have to deal w. a rando on my departure. Something to think about 
2018-02-02 23:07:52	mrgray4	We might 
2018-02-02 23:08:57	mrgray4	Jesse, a friend, and I are graduating winter ?18 but our 4th is graduating undergrad this semester 
2018-02-02 23:09:09	mrgray4	However he may come back for CSC grad
2018-02-02 23:09:09		School 
2018-02-05 18:41:48	jkayani	Hey @gjabell did you install Burp from the shell script on their website? I was curious what the binary garbage at the bottom of it was; it seems like a normal `.sh` file, and it has plaintext shell commands at the top, but after that it's weird stuff 
2018-02-05 18:42:15	jkayani	Like it's a Java application and all, is that supposed to be JAR data or something? 
2018-02-05 18:42:23	gjabell	I just used the aur package xD 
2018-02-05 18:42:38	jkayani	Ah OK - I've seen this technique in shell scripts before so I was wondering if you had either 
2018-02-05 18:43:01	jkayani	In case you're curious: https://portswigger.net/burp/communitydownload

2018-02-05 18:48:28	gjabell	ugh, that's weird 
2018-02-05 18:48:42	gjabell	explains why it's almost 100 mb tho xD 
2018-02-05 18:49:05	jkayani	Right? Yeah I'm just going to AUR this one anyway 
2018-02-05 18:50:51	gjabell	yeah 
2018-02-05 18:51:04	gjabell	I generally prefer to just aur everything so it stays up to date 
2018-02-05 18:51:10	jkayani	^ Makes sense 
2018-02-05 18:51:32	gjabell	also if you want an alternative to yaourt check out aura 
2018-02-05 18:51:40	jkayani	I don't use any of those 
2018-02-05 18:51:46	jkayani	I just clone and `makepkg` lol 
2018-02-05 18:52:00	gjabell	ah xD you're a better linux user than me lol 
2018-02-05 18:52:27	jkayani	Lol I only do it b/c I can't be bothered to learn a tool so 
2018-02-05 18:52:37	gjabell	fair enough 
2018-02-05 18:52:50	gjabell	I like aura bc I can just sub a different letter and it'll do the same stuff as pacman 
2018-02-05 18:53:12	gjabell	ie aura -S searches the base arch linux repos, and aura -A searches aur 
2018-02-05 18:53:34	gjabell	makes it real easy to upgrade as well, I just have upgrade aliased to aura -Syu && aura -Ayu 
2018-02-10 16:05:26	gjabell	Anyone want a 24u server rack? 
2018-02-10 16:06:46	jesse	nope. But it makes me sad that you dont wanna keep it lol. 
2018-02-10 16:07:04	gjabell	I might have found a better one :P 
2018-02-10 16:07:34	jesse	Hahaha what the heck dude?! where do you even find this stuff? 
2018-02-10 16:07:51	gjabell	Craigslist xD 
2018-02-10 16:08:05	gjabell	I found a soundproof one for cheap lol 
2018-02-10 16:10:54	jesse	do people build their own servers like they build their own desktops? 
2018-02-10 16:11:07	jesse	or do they just buy the unit? 
2018-02-10 16:11:35	gjabell	Depends, you can get a rack mount case and put components in it
2018-02-10 16:11:35		If it's enterprise grade you typically just buy the unit tho 
2018-02-10 16:13:24	jesse	gotcha. well,  I've still got ways to go before my nerd levels are high enough to want servers/ server racks. good luck dude. 
2018-02-10 16:13:53	gjabell	XD thanks, figured I'd ask just in case l 
2018-02-10 16:13:55	gjabell	L* 
2018-02-10 16:13:59	gjabell	Fak 
2018-02-10 16:14:04	gjabell	Lol* 
2018-02-10 16:14:10	jesse	lol 
2018-02-10 16:21:25	chrisaben	The server rack is tempting lol 
2018-02-10 16:21:44	gjabell	you know you want it :) 
2018-02-16 09:55:13	mrgray4	@gjabell still selling the server rack? how much? I know someone maybe interested

2017-05-25 21:47:56	carl	Anyone taking Parameterized Algorithms & Complexity with Sullivan? :joy: 
2017-05-25 21:48:20	chrisaben	Me 
2017-05-25 21:49:20	carl	Masochism? :thinking_face: 
2017-05-25 21:50:05	carl	Actually looks like a cool class though. :+1: 
2017-05-25 21:50:22	chrisaben	I think she's brilliant and optimization is something I'm very interested in so it makes sense for me to take her class I guess 
2017-05-25 21:50:39	chrisaben	She was one of the only teachers I like in CSC tbh  
2017-05-25 21:51:06	chrisaben	Even though it was a fucking theory course lol 
2017-05-25 21:54:17	mrgray4	Great teacher. Great slides (except those proof paragraphs). Awful workload  
2017-05-25 21:54:20	carl	Her research looks really top notch. Does she only teach the math/theory courses? 
2017-05-25 21:56:05	chrisaben	Well the parameterization course is a theory/practical, with a focus on research 
2017-05-25 21:57:07	carl	Unrelated, but I'm currently working with a distributed computing system with 25K cores and 3 PB of storage. :heart_eyes: 
2017-05-25 22:10:54	mrgray4	I really like her I just can't mentally deal with the class. Maybe? I'm honestly still so undecided on this fall 
2017-05-25 22:11:06	mrgray4	If I stay with my job (which I love) I may be a part time student 
2017-05-25 22:11:18	mrgray4	Also @carl :heart_eyes::heart_eyes::weary: 
2017-05-26 08:57:23	carl	@mrgray4 Where are you working? I remember discussing this, but those memories have been overwritten by the last three Sturgill lectures. 
2017-05-26 09:00:13	mrgray4	ChannelAdvisor! ECommerce company. They allow a company to synchronize their inventory and orders across multiple platforms like Amazon Walmart eBay etc while also offering statistics and other stuff and things 
2017-05-26 09:00:24	mrgray4	What about you? Overwritten similarly :p 
2017-05-26 09:01:36	carl	Computational Social Science REU at Notre Dame. 
2017-06-04 13:00:00	jkayani	Looking back I really like Sullivan too. She did a pretty good job running the course, answered questions promptly, and tried to be as clear as possible. Personally, I don't think I'm really interested in theory enough (or smart enough to really get something out of it lol) to take her 495, but I'm sure it'll be a good experience. [:heart:2] 
2017-06-04 13:00:19	jkayani	Even if she was the "harder" prof. for 333, I'm glad I took her. [:heart:2] 
2017-06-04 13:00:49	jkayani	Also @carl what are you using that system to study? 
2017-06-04 13:01:05	jkayani	And @mrgray4 what do you at ChannelAdvisor? Like what team are you on? 
2017-06-04 13:32:54	carl	@jkayani We are working on creating a global agent-based model at a scale of 7.6 billion people. 
2017-06-04 13:50:21	mrgray4	@jkayani so I'm on the "ChannelSync" team which deals with the synchronization component of the software (the main part of it honestly, synchronizing products and inventory between the people selling them and the markets they're selling them on) 
2017-06-04 13:52:52	mrgray4	@jkayani I'm working on making a new Redis (kinda like a key value/NoSQL storage solution if you don't already know) data provider for them to replace an existing one. It was storing their data structures very inefficiently. I'm doing it by storing a shell of a lot of the data and then storing the actual data (sometimes megabytes worth) in S3 instead of megabytes worth in one value of a key value pair 
2017-06-04 13:53:08	mrgray4	They were getting so many out of memory exceptions lol 
2017-06-04 14:08:38	jkayani	Sounds really cool @mrgray4 - kinda like what I'm doing at the Dude actually
2017-06-04 14:08:38		It turns out the company's main business is software to manage work orders for different industries, like schools and governments and stuff. With those work orders, they get a bunch of data and make pretty analytics-esque graphs and stuff, but want to squeeze more out of it. So I'm working on a "data lake" (data just flows in/out of the lake, also noSQL) where we're building a Hadoop cluster (and associated infrastructure) to squeeze more juice out of the data (not sure exactly what), and supposedly help them migrate from old legacy data repos to this new thing. 
2017-06-04 14:08:46	jkayani	@carl what does the model model? 
2017-06-04 14:17:38	mrgray4	@jkayani that sounds awesome! Can you just create fields/groups from the lake keys? Is that the out flow? 
2017-06-04 14:36:25	carl	@jkayani Currently we are using the simulator to model human migration. 
2017-06-07 13:02:59	mrgray4	Presented in a sprint review for the first time today, 2nd finished feature :100:  
2017-06-07 13:04:35	mrgray4	Also guys I want some opinions. It?s highly likely I?ll be offered to stay on during the fall. Knowing that I value my free time/gym time, my two options are: drop down to 6 or 9 hours and do this part time OR leave on amicable terms 
2017-06-07 13:04:52	mrgray4	Also depends on how much work they?d want me to do per week if I stayed on 
2017-06-07 14:26:20	carl	How much are they paying you?  How many more credits do you need to graduate? 
2017-06-07 14:42:15	mrgray4	So that?s the breakdown. 40 hours left it says? That includes the 14 I have this coming semester 
2017-06-07 14:42:45	mrgray4	Currently getting $25 an hour, but if I stayed on should I expect more? 
2017-06-07 14:42:56	mrgray4	@mrgray4 uploaded a file: https://sturgill-operators.slack.com/files/U3WBH0F7G/F5R2UK8JK/image_uploaded_from_ios.jpg (/) 
2017-06-07 14:43:30	mrgray4	If I was around 10 a semester I could graduate in 4 
2017-06-07 14:43:40	adyfrancis	Usually companies evaluate interns yearly  
2017-06-07 14:43:55	mrgray4	Hmm okay. Thanks Ady 
2017-06-07 14:44:18	adyfrancis	$25/hour is insane I would consider working during the year it's really not that bad  
2017-06-07 14:44:21	mrgray4	I?m pretty damn happy with $25, so I guess I?d be fine in that regard 
2017-06-07 14:44:26	mrgray4	Yeah^ 
2017-06-07 14:44:48	mrgray4	I really don?t want to throw away something god 
2017-06-07 14:44:50	mrgray4	Good* 
2017-06-07 14:44:55	carl	How many hours would you be working in the Fall? 
2017-06-07 14:45:21	adyfrancis	I mean you can ask them, hey can I just come back next summer they'll probably say yes if it's likely they want you in the fall as well 
2017-06-07 14:45:23	mrgray4	Don?t know. I?d expect 20 or less. Hopefully closer to 10 because software engineering 
2017-06-07 14:46:03	mrgray4	I?m going to have a 1on1 with my boss Monday and that?s when I plan to ask details about it. I know it?s early but I?m trying to get my plans lined up 
2017-06-07 14:46:40	adyfrancis	It won't be easy for sure to do school + work but it depends on how flexible they are with hours. Plus like however far it is from school 
2017-06-07 14:47:18	mrgray4	Also I think they?re pretty good about work from home. I?m guessing I?d go in once a week to catch up and then do the rest of the work from home 
2017-06-07 14:47:50	mrgray4	My coworker has done it and he?s full time, but I?m taking what he says with a grain of salt because I think he is the king of productivity 
2017-06-07 14:48:21	adyfrancis	Haha yeah working from home is hard. Especially during school cause you're gonna wanna do school work  
2017-06-07 14:49:18	adyfrancis	I do school work at work but being in an office helps me not completely dismiss my office work. Where do you work again? How far is it from campus 
2017-06-07 14:50:06	mrgray4	ChannelAdvisor. About 10 miles down wade/I40 from campus.  
2017-06-07 14:50:58	adyfrancis	Oooh that's a drive. You can try splitting your week into MWF/TuTh 
2017-06-07 14:51:19	adyfrancis	Or try for more online classes idk 
2017-06-07 14:51:39	carl	You could always quit your job and quit school. :thinking_face: 
2017-06-07 14:52:45	adyfrancis	I'll do it if Matt does it  
2017-06-07 14:53:45	mrgray4	Just dropped out in my pack 
2017-06-07 14:53:49	mrgray4	Do it 
2017-06-07 14:54:28	adyfrancis	The mad man 
2017-06-07 14:56:59	mrgray4	There?s pretty much no way to not make my schedule every day because of god damned SE 
2017-06-07 14:57:31	chrisaben	You could always not take SE :yum: 
2017-06-07 14:57:34	adyfrancis	Cause of lab, right? Try to make lab the only class that day  
2017-06-07 14:57:48	mrgray4	Also @carl specifically but anyone who likes to jam to tunes, any good music lately?  
2017-06-07 14:57:56	mrgray4	I have two other classes that day :/ 
2017-06-07 14:58:31	mrgray4	I could not... but a lot of people including one of my roommates are so I?m doing it while the resources are hella

2017-06-08 20:25:18	adyfrancis	It's a pretty easy one I think the answer key might be wrong or I'm missing something  
2017-06-08 20:25:49	adyfrancis	@adyfrancis uploaded a file: https://sturgill-operators.slack.com/files/U3Z34UFQF/F5QG61BB3/image_uploaded_from_ios.jpg (Image uploaded from iOS) and commented: The answer is A 
2017-06-08 23:57:27	mrgray4	Sorry about the delay 
2017-06-08 23:57:45	mrgray4	So ja I?m pretty sure is unsigned jump above 
2017-06-09 00:01:53	mrgray4	1: ax=1 bx=4, init 
2017-06-09 00:01:53		2: ax=2 bx=4, add 1 to ax
2017-06-09 00:01:53		3: ax=2 bx=2, sub ax from bx
2017-06-09 00:01:53		4: ax=2 bx=2, cmp/ja (ax=bx, so a is not above b so continue)
2017-06-09 00:01:53		5: ax=3, bx=2, add 1 to ax
2017-06-09 00:01:53		6: ax=3, bx=-1 (SIGN FLAG SET HERE)
2017-06-09 00:01:53		7: sign flag set above, registers now on this jump above causing it to be below thus falls through 
2017-06-09 00:02:09	mrgray4	And as you can see ax=3 
2017-06-09 17:51:12	adyfrancis	Sorry I forgot to check this, I sent an email to the professor haha should've updated. Although he didn't explain it very well so thanks 
2017-06-17 17:14:57	jkayani	Well, guess who forgot to check their Slack! Sorry for the late response
2017-06-17 17:14:57		@mrgray4 Not sure I understand the question - afaik, the lake is intended to be able to store/manipulate structured legacy data alongside data from their other platforms. Right now, all we're doing is building a proof of concept of already existing functionality by importing legacy data into our Hadoop-powered data lake and linking it up to some BI tool. It doesn't sound super difficult at first, but getting Hadoop and co. setup and running correctly and smoothly is an ongoing battle with firewall rules and ports, and then the import from legacy data repos is being done via: legacy->CSV->data lake. The CSV creates a bottleneck b/c it has to have a lot of badly formed records purged, otherwise the data lake will be "contaminated" lol.  Our second sprint review is Tuesday, and we're aiming to be able to query the clean data lake quicker than with the current RDBMS and move on to actually integrating the BI tool with the lake. 
2017-06-17 17:14:57		Also what'd you end up deciding about school/work for the next semester or so? 
2017-06-17 18:05:56	mrgray4	@jkayani Interesting! I just read the wiki page on data lake and it made me realize "oh duh that's what it is." I hope it works out well. So I'm enjoying work more and more as it goes, and I think I'll try and stay on if the work can be minimized to part time (<= 20hrs would be great) 
2017-06-17 18:06:45	mrgray4	For the rest of the summer, my goal is to read the 900 page (not bad 900, a lot of the pages aren't dense to do code examples and a lot of spacing) swift ebook apple released. It's really well done and documents the entire language in an educational matter so I can get even better with the platform. 
2017-06-17 18:07:26	mrgray4	!channel who's taking ethics in the fall? I think I'm going to push it back to spring because I've heard it's a bitch with software engineering due to it taking time for monotonous work (what I've heard) 
2017-06-17 18:08:39	carl	Push back Software Engineering instead. :hugging_face::hugging_face::hugging_face: 
2017-06-17 18:08:50	mrgray4	I mean... I could 
2017-06-17 18:08:57	mrgray4	It's totally possible 
2017-06-17 18:09:05	mrgray4	I could try for research this fall 
2017-07-28 16:14:47	carl	@mrgray4 Congrats on completing your advising of channels! 
2017-07-29 15:15:06	mrgray4	Thank you so much. If I come back they have a prioritized spot for me. Idk if full time SE is what I wanna do but if I don?t find something I like more within the next couple of years then it?s probably where I?ll go.

2017-07-29 15:15:53	mrgray4	What have your thoughts been on research? 
2017-07-29 15:17:41	carl	It's pretty great! Working on submitting a paper to a conference this weekend. Going the grad school route doesn't make economic sense though so I dunno long term yet. :thinking_face: [:thinking_face:1]  (edited)

2017-10-04 22:28:41	carl	If you ever feel like you aren't competent enough to work in Software, just remember that next semester's courses come out on the 11th and not the 9th because they think the new MyPack system is pretty much guaranteed to crash, but they decided to roll out during registration anyways.  [:fire:1] 
2017-10-10 13:34:09	jkayani	Lol do they usually do the course release on the 9th? 
2017-10-10 13:36:36	jesse	its usually much earlier.. but i think that since the new mypack just opened, they didn't wanna deal with it.

2018-01-29 17:37:39	carl	I feel personally attacked. **DELETING** all my passwords and moving to Northwest Idaho.  
2018-01-29 17:38:10	mrgray4	Is Northwestern Idaho the most secluded portion? 
2018-01-29 17:43:12	carl	Ted Kaczynski ruined moving to a remote cabin in Montana, so NW Idaho is the best substitute. [:joy:1 :bomb:1] 
2018-01-29 18:05:50	mrgray4	Hahahaha I was going to ask why not Montana, fair point 
2018-02-01 17:43:36	carl	I'm on-campus for the entire day on Tuesdays/Thursdays if anyone wants to catch dinner at some point.  
2018-02-01 17:48:05	mrgray4	Til what time? 
2018-02-01 17:51:41	mrgray4	I have homemade soup if you want to visit wolfridge! Courtesy of my mother 
2018-02-01 17:52:13	carl	I'm 100% down for this! 
2018-02-01 18:01:21	carl	I've got nothing until around 8 PM.  
2018-02-01 18:03:45	mrgray4	:D sounds good. Just got off a phone call, I?m back at my apt now so come over and I?ll let you in 
2018-02-01 18:04:41	mrgray4	I live in Lakeview. I?m doing nothing either will probably just gonna work on hw tonight 
2018-02-01 18:08:17	carl	Sounds great. I'll head over.  
2018-02-01 18:33:56	mrgray4	Do you see a grassy knoll 
2018-02-01 18:34:12	mrgray4	Not the one Kennedy was around 
2018-02-02 21:28:50	jkayani	Anyone in Wolf Ride next semester looking for a roommate? B/c that's where I'm trying to go 
2018-02-02 21:29:21	jkayani	I say next semester b/c it's probably my last, so you'd have to deal w. a rando on my departure. Something to think about 
2018-02-02 23:07:52	mrgray4	We might 
2018-02-02 23:08:57	mrgray4	Jesse, a friend, and I are graduating winter ?18 but our 4th is graduating undergrad this semester 
2018-02-02 23:09:09	mrgray4	However he may come back for CSC grad

2018-02-05 18:41:48	jkayani	Hey @gjabell did you install Burp from the shell script on their website? I was curious what the binary garbage at the bottom of it was; it seems like a normal `.sh` file, and it has plaintext shell commands at the top, but after that it's weird stuff 
2018-02-05 18:42:15	jkayani	Like it's a Java application and all, is that supposed to be JAR data or something? 
2018-02-05 18:42:23	gjabell	I just used the aur package xD 
2018-02-05 18:42:38	jkayani	Ah OK - I've seen this technique in shell scripts before so I was wondering if you had either 
2018-02-05 18:43:01	jkayani	In case you're curious: https://portswigger.net/burp/communitydownload
2018-02-05 18:43:01		Download Burp Suite Community Edition
2018-02-05 18:43:01		PortSwigger offers tools for web application security, testing & scanning. Choose from a wide range of security tools & identify the very latest vulnerabilities. 
2018-02-05 18:48:28	gjabell	ugh, that's weird 
2018-02-05 18:48:42	gjabell	explains why it's almost 100 mb tho xD 
2018-02-05 18:49:05	jkayani	Right? Yeah I'm just going to AUR this one anyway 
2018-02-05 18:50:51	gjabell	yeah 
2018-02-05 18:51:04	gjabell	I generally prefer to just aur everything so it stays up to date 
2018-02-05 18:51:10	jkayani	^ Makes sense 
2018-02-05 18:51:32	gjabell	also if you want an alternative to yaourt check out aura 
2018-02-05 18:51:40	jkayani	I don't use any of those 
2018-02-05 18:51:46	jkayani	I just clone and `makepkg` lol 
2018-02-05 18:52:00	gjabell	ah xD you're a better linux user than me lol 
2018-02-05 18:52:27	jkayani	Lol I only do it b/c I can't be bothered to learn a tool so 
2018-02-05 18:52:37	gjabell	fair enough 
2018-02-05 18:52:50	gjabell	I like aura bc I can just sub a different letter and it'll do the same stuff as pacman 
2018-02-05 18:53:12	gjabell	ie aura -S searches the base arch linux repos, and aura -A searches aur 
2018-02-05 18:53:34	gjabell	makes it real easy to upgrade as well, I just have upgrade aliased to aura -Syu && aura -Ayu 
2018-02-10 16:05:26	gjabell	Anyone want a 24u server rack? 
2018-02-10 16:06:46	jesse	nope. But it makes me sad that you dont wanna keep it lol. 
2018-02-10 16:07:04	gjabell	I might have found a better one :P 
2018-02-10 16:07:34	jesse	Hahaha what the heck dude?! where do you even find this stuff? 
2018-02-10 16:07:51	gjabell	Craigslist xD 
2018-02-10 16:08:05	gjabell	I found a soundproof one for cheap lol 
2018-02-10 16:10:54	jesse	do people build their own servers like they build their own desktops? 
2018-02-10 16:11:07	jesse	or do they just buy the unit? 
2018-02-10 16:11:35	gjabell	Depends, you can get a rack mount case and put components in it
2018-02-10 16:11:35		If it's enterprise grade you typically just buy the unit tho 
2018-02-10 16:13:24	jesse	gotcha. well,  I've still got ways to go before my nerd levels are high enough to want servers/ server racks. good luck dude. 
2018-02-10 16:13:53	gjabell	XD thanks, figured I'd ask just in case l 
2018-02-10 16:13:55	gjabell	L* 
2018-02-10 16:13:59	gjabell	Fak 
2018-02-10 16:14:04	gjabell	Lol*

2018-02-10 16:21:44	gjabell	you know you want it :) 
2018-02-16 09:55:13	mrgray4	@gjabell still selling the server rack? how much? I know someone maybe interested

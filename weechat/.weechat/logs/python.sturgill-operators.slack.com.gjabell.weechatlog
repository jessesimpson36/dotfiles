2018-03-16 14:24:21	jesse	i'm trying to figure out how to message you lol 
2018-03-16 14:31:53	jesse	ok i got it back, but idk how to change the channel to gjabell 
2018-03-16 14:32:17	gjabell	try /buffer [whatever number shows up for me in the sidebar] 
2018-03-16 14:31:31		getting channel history...
2018-01-10 16:00:58	jesse	yo 
2018-01-10 16:01:03	gjabell	heyo 
2018-01-10 16:01:10	gjabell	this is going to make my life so much easier xD 
2018-01-10 16:02:29	jesse	I'm glad!! but you graduate some time soonish right? 
2018-01-10 16:02:40	gjabell	probably may 2019 
2018-01-10 16:02:43	gjabell	so a little while 
2018-01-10 16:02:51	jesse	oh ok. December for me 
2018-01-10 16:03:17	gjabell	ah, nice 
2018-01-10 16:04:14	jesse	yeah i don't really know about that ddns stuff. it's fancy talk but I think I understand what it does. 
2018-01-10 16:04:14		i stopped my server until i know what i want to do with it. 
2018-01-10 16:04:33	gjabell	ah 
2018-01-10 16:04:40	gjabell	you know what DNS is, right? 
2018-01-10 16:04:47	gjabell	domain names to IPs 
2018-01-10 16:04:52	jesse	yup 
2018-01-10 16:04:57	gjabell	ddns is dynamic dns 
2018-01-10 16:05:04	jesse	ahh! 
2018-01-10 16:05:06	gjabell	basically, a DNS record only works if you know the ip address of something 
2018-01-10 16:05:18	gjabell	and if you don't have a static IP, the domain will break as soon as your public IP changes 
2018-01-10 16:05:35	gjabell	ddns is basically a service where you can periodically update your DNS to point at your IP

2018-01-10 16:06:07	gjabell	really there's no reason xD 
2018-01-10 16:06:14	gjabell	I guess if you were running a DNS server :P 
2018-01-10 16:06:23	gjabell	cause as it turns out 
2018-01-10 16:06:32	gjabell	kinda hard to use DNS if you can't get it from the server xD 
2018-01-10 16:06:37	jesse	lets run a DNS server through DDNS 
2018-01-10 16:06:42	gjabell	lol 
2018-01-10 16:07:03	gjabell	I don't know that many places make you pay for a static ip anymore, not sure tho 
2018-01-10 16:07:07	gjabell	probably depends on the company 
2018-01-10 16:09:17	jesse	why are static ip addresses expensive? 
2018-01-10 16:09:27	gjabell	tbh not really sure 
2018-01-10 16:09:36	gjabell	I guess it probably requires more effort from the company 
2018-01-10 16:09:48	gjabell	dhcp is easy because you can just let a computer handle it

2018-01-10 16:10:07	jesse	if you use ddns, youre basically taking away multiple possible ips rather than just one.... 
2018-01-10 16:10:31	gjabell	why? 
2018-01-10 16:13:53	jesse	well im kinda thinking about it like a pool of marbles. each one representing an ip address. if people took 1 out and only needed that 1... it would be simple and cheap to distribute... if we had a system of replacing a marble every hour or so, imagine how complex it would be to maintain which ips are used and which arent....  but i know computers are good at that stuff so it doesnt really matter..  
2018-01-10 16:20:29	jesse	point being, i think it would be cheaper to use ip addresses but it isnt. 
2018-01-10 16:25:59	gjabell	I don't think it's actually too difficult, basically there's a computer that keeps track of all assigned ips, and each ip address has a lease time (typically 24 hours or something), once the lease runs out the computer that was assigned the ip requests a new ip, and the computer hands it a new one (or typically the same one it had before unless that's now being used by something else)

2018-02-06 12:46:09	jesse	Hey Galen, have you had to screen-record on linux before? 
2018-02-06 13:24:26	gjabell	I did for the guided project in software engineering 
2018-02-06 13:24:40	gjabell	I think I used obs iirc 
2018-02-06 13:26:31	jesse	haven't tried that one. but all i can get is a black screen with a cursor as output :(
2018-02-06 13:26:31		I'm gonna try getting on a computer at the library and see if my PowerPoint can be opened with sound on there 
2018-02-06 13:26:51	gjabell	weird 
2018-02-06 13:26:55	gjabell	what program are you using 
2018-02-06 13:27:35	jesse	i used screencast, ffmpeg, simplescreenrecorder, and one other one. 
2018-02-06 13:28:31	gjabell	Hmm 
2018-02-06 13:30:44	jesse	why can't teachers just use libreoffice :'( 
2018-02-06 13:30:48	jesse	lol 
2018-02-06 13:31:08	gjabell	Ikr 
2018-03-01 13:27:05	jesse	are you studying any more than what we did on tuesday? 
2018-03-01 14:01:53	gjabell	I went over review 6 again bc that was the one I had the most trouble with 
2018-03-01 14:01:59	gjabell	didn't do much other than that tho 
2018-03-01 14:04:24	jesse	gotcha. I'm probably not gonna touch the material. 
2018-03-01 14:04:42	gjabell	yeah at this point I think I'm just going to let the chips fall where they do 
2018-03-12 18:34:19	gjabell	are you in the data-driven decision making special topics? 
2018-03-12 18:42:29	jesse	i was last semester 
2018-03-12 18:42:39	gjabell	was it fun 
2018-03-12 18:42:41	jesse	good easy A that got me a job that I am currently working. 
2018-03-12 18:42:52	jesse	all python 
2018-03-12 18:42:52	gjabell	seems good then, I might take it next semester 
2018-03-12 18:43:05	gjabell	do you know if there's reason to take soft. sec. if I'm taking comp. sec. atm 
2018-03-12 19:09:22	jesse	its easier and dr. king 
2018-03-13 07:33:09	gjabell	Fair XD
2018-03-13 07:33:09		Atm it's either that or decision making 
2018-03-13 09:19:16	jesse	take them both. surely theres another csc course you could get rid of? 
2018-03-13 09:22:26	gjabell	Well, I'm taking databases as my restricted elective, so I was going to take one of those two as an 'other elective'
2018-03-13 09:22:26		Plus I kinda figure I shoudlnt overload too much on csc since I want to take senior design 
2018-03-13 09:26:04	jesse	Ms. Marini told me to take other restricted electives that were not computer science cuz she thought I was gonna overwork myself with senior design. 
2018-03-13 09:26:29	jesse	she also wants me to either take a class over the summer or not work... :disappointed: 
2018-03-13 09:26:49	gjabell	Lol why 
2018-03-13 09:28:07	gjabell	All the other electives suxk tho 
2018-03-13 09:28:28	jesse	I'm gonna be taking Human Computer Interaction and soft security 
2018-03-13 09:31:07	jesse	and senior design and I've got 2 other psy classes... I was gonna have cryptography in place of one of those psychology classes but marini said computer science is hard and it would be too much, so I should take Ergonomics instead lol.
2018-03-13 09:31:07		she also  said that senior design was gonna be a big time suck and that there would be plenty of times that I would have to meet up with either my team or the teachers outside of class or whatever. 
2018-03-13 09:31:48	jesse	I kinda agree with her. dunno if I will take a summer class or if I will drop working though 
2018-03-13 09:33:22	gjabell	Wait were you thinking of working next semester? Or does she wajt you to drop your internship? 
2018-03-13 09:37:27	jesse	haha not my internship. I've been doing research this semester for $$$ but she wants me to either drop it for the next semester or to drop a class next semester and keep it... Right now, I'm not quite sure what the financially correct option is. 
2018-03-13 09:37:47	gjabell	Oh OK lol 
2018-03-13 09:38:40	jesse	lol if marini told me to drop my internship I would probably scoff and use her computer to lift my advisement hold and leave. 
2018-03-13 09:39:17	gjabell	Lol yeah 
2018-03-16 13:53:02	gjabell	so I was bored and started writing a cli interface for slack using go 
2018-03-16 13:53:22	gjabell	but then I found out someone made a plugin for weechat, which is way more featured than anything I'd end up making 
2018-03-16 13:55:27	gjabell	so now I can move even more of my life to the command line :D 
2018-03-16 13:56:09	jesse	it's the same truth about programming.... everything has already been made haha.  
2018-03-16 13:56:09		so what is weechat? 
2018-03-16 13:56:43	gjabell	yeah xD 
2018-03-16 13:56:46	gjabell	it's an IRC client 
2018-03-16 13:56:53	gjabell	with lots of plugin options 
2018-03-16 13:57:04	jesse	awesome. I miss IRC. 
2018-03-16 13:57:15	gjabell	slack has an IRC gateway but they are decommisioning it 
2018-03-16 13:57:25	gjabell	but this plugin just uses their api so it still works 
2018-03-16 13:57:48	gjabell	https://github.com/wee-slack/wee-slack
2018-03-16 13:57:48		wee-slack/wee-slack

2018-03-16 13:58:47	gjabell	@gjabell uploaded a file: https://sturgill-operators.slack.com/files/U5AUU7HHA/F9R7M593M/2018-03-16-135733_2544x1427_scrot.png (2018-03-16-135733 2544x1427 scrot) 
2018-03-16 13:59:04	gjabell	I think I'm in love 
2018-03-16 13:59:20	jesse	also, what are you gonna do when everything you do is in a terminal? give up i3? 
2018-03-16 13:59:32	gjabell	xD I guess so yeah 
2018-03-16 13:59:40	jesse	omg that is soo coool 
2018-03-16 13:59:43	gjabell	i3 is basically tmux for a ui,so I guess I'll just move to tmux lol 
2018-03-16 13:59:51	gjabell	although web browsing in w3m kinda sucks so idk 
2018-03-16 13:59:55	gjabell	ikr 
2018-03-16 14:00:03	gjabell	it's super easy to setup too 
2018-03-16 14:00:40	jesse	i was gonna play a video game, but you gave my life meaning once more. 
2018-03-16 14:02:56	gjabell	:) 
2018-03-16 14:04:41	gjabell	ofc now I have to go spend a whole weekend exploring all the configuration xD 
2018-03-16 14:09:29	jesse	w3m isnt all that bad if we never needed wolfware or mypack 
2018-03-16 14:09:49	gjabell	that's fair I guess 
2018-03-16 14:09:56	gjabell	navigating is a bit of a pain tho 
2018-03-16 14:10:02	gjabell	at least until you get used to it I imagine 
2018-03-16 14:24:21	jesse	i'm trying to figure out how to message you lol 
2018-03-16 14:25:55	gjabell	worked on my side xD 
2018-03-16 14:26:08	gjabell	did you message me through weechat or the interface 
2018-03-16 14:26:27	jesse	yeah its a bit of a pain right now... I closed out and it looks like i need to go through the registration again. 
2018-03-16 14:26:32	jesse	UI 
2018-03-16 14:26:49	gjabell	oh 
2018-03-16 14:27:07	gjabell	after you register I think you need to do '/save' 
2018-03-16 14:27:16	gjabell	and it'll write it out to the conf file 
2018-03-16 14:27:41	gjabell	also I'd suggest using the secure method they mention if you're going to be committing it to any repos 
2018-03-16 14:27:49	jesse	the config file isn't loading either so I have to manually do that... 
2018-03-16 14:27:54	gjabell	hmm 
2018-03-16 14:27:58	gjabell	how did you configure it? 
2018-03-16 14:28:11	jesse	i just followed the installation instructions 
2018-03-16 14:28:24	gjabell	so wait if you open weechat does it load everything correctly? 
2018-03-16 14:28:38	gjabell	bc originally it wasn't loading the python script for me bc I used python3 instead of 2 
2018-03-16 14:28:42	gjabell	for the websocket-client 
2018-03-16 14:28:50	jesse	that might be it. 
2018-03-16 14:28:56	jesse	it isn't loading 
2018-03-16 14:29:21	gjabell	try installing python2-pip and using pip2 install to get the websocket-client 
2018-03-16 14:29:26	gjabell	that's what worked for me 
2018-03-16 14:30:25	jesse	yeah I have that...why cant people just decide which version of python people should universally use? :disappointed: 
2018-03-16 14:30:42	jesse	or make it back compatible. 
2018-03-16 14:31:06	gjabell	ikr 
2018-03-16 14:31:53	jesse	ok i got it back, but idk how to change the channel to gjabell 
2018-03-16 14:32:17	gjabell	try /buffer [whatever number shows up for me in the sidebar] 
2018-03-16 14:32:42	jesse	:) 
2018-03-16 14:32:45	jesse	:( 
2018-03-16 14:32:49	gjabell	rip xD 
2018-03-16 14:32:50	jesse	testing 
2018-03-16 14:32:54	jesse	yeayy 
2018-03-16 14:32:56	gjabell	woop 
2018-03-16 14:33:17	gjabell	you can switch things in the sidebar with ALT+number, or ALT+arrow keys 
2018-03-16 14:33:23	gjabell	or /buffer number 
2018-03-16 14:33:37	jesse	now we gotta get this running on my raspberry pi so I can ssh into it using my phone... 
2018-03-16 14:33:37	gjabell	or there's a script that let's you matched based on names 
2018-03-16 14:33:41	gjabell	lol xD 
2018-03-16 14:33:45	gjabell	shouldn't be too hard 
2018-03-16 14:34:33	jesse	I'm gonna work on loading my other channels in here. I wonder how this application is memory-wise... cuz the gui takes up loads of memory 
2018-03-16 14:34:47	gjabell	it's probably super minimal 
2018-03-16 14:35:08	gjabell	223M according to htop 
2018-03-16 14:35:31	gjabell	I don't even have the gui installed anymore so I can't check lol 
2018-03-16 14:36:43		getting channel history...
2018-01-10 16:00:58	jesse	yo 
2018-01-10 16:01:03	gjabell	heyo 
2018-01-10 16:01:10	gjabell	this is going to make my life so much easier xD 
2018-01-10 16:02:29	jesse	I'm glad!! but you graduate some time soonish right? 
2018-01-10 16:02:40	gjabell	probably may 2019 
2018-01-10 16:02:43	gjabell	so a little while

2018-02-06 13:24:26	gjabell	I did for the guided project in software engineering 
2018-02-06 13:24:40	gjabell	I think I used obs iirc 
2018-02-06 13:26:31	jesse	haven't tried that one. but all i can get is a black screen with a cursor as output :(
2018-02-06 13:26:31		I'm gonna try getting on a computer at the library and see if my PowerPoint can be opened with sound on there 
2018-02-06 13:26:51	gjabell	weird 
2018-02-06 13:26:55	gjabell	what program are you using 
2018-02-06 13:27:35	jesse	i used screencast, ffmpeg, simplescreenrecorder, and one other one. 
2018-02-06 13:28:31	gjabell	Hmm 
2018-02-06 13:30:44	jesse	why can't teachers just use libreoffice :'( 
2018-02-06 13:30:48	jesse	lol 
2018-02-06 13:31:08	gjabell	Ikr 
2018-03-01 13:27:05	jesse	are you studying any more than what we did on tuesday? 
2018-03-01 14:01:53	gjabell	I went over review 6 again bc that was the one I had the most trouble with 
2018-03-01 14:01:59	gjabell	didn't do much other than that tho 
2018-03-01 14:04:24	jesse	gotcha. I'm probably not gonna touch the material. 
2018-03-01 14:04:42	gjabell	yeah at this point I think I'm just going to let the chips fall where they do 
2018-03-12 18:34:19	gjabell	are you in the data-driven decision making special topics? 
2018-03-12 18:42:29	jesse	i was last semester 
2018-03-12 18:42:39	gjabell	was it fun 
2018-03-12 18:42:41	jesse	good easy A that got me a job that I am currently working. 
2018-03-12 18:42:52	jesse	all python 
2018-03-12 18:42:52	gjabell	seems good then, I might take it next semester 
2018-03-12 18:43:05	gjabell	do you know if there's reason to take soft. sec. if I'm taking comp. sec. atm 
2018-03-12 19:09:22	jesse	its easier and dr. king 
2018-03-13 07:33:09	gjabell	Fair XD
2018-03-13 07:33:09		Atm it's either that or decision making 
2018-03-13 09:19:16	jesse	take them both. surely theres another csc course you could get rid of? 
2018-03-13 09:22:26	gjabell	Well, I'm taking databases as my restricted elective, so I was going to take one of those two as an 'other elective'
2018-03-13 09:22:26		Plus I kinda figure I shoudlnt overload too much on csc since I want to take senior design 
2018-03-13 09:26:04	jesse	Ms. Marini told me to take other restricted electives that were not computer science cuz she thought I was gonna overwork myself with senior design. 
2018-03-13 09:26:29	jesse	she also wants me to either take a class over the summer or not work... :disappointed: 
2018-03-13 09:26:49	gjabell	Lol why 
2018-03-13 09:28:07	gjabell	All the other electives suxk tho 
2018-03-13 09:28:28	jesse	I'm gonna be taking Human Computer Interaction and soft security 
2018-03-13 09:31:07	jesse	and senior design and I've got 2 other psy classes... I was gonna have cryptography in place of one of those psychology classes but marini said computer science is hard and it would be too much, so I should take Ergonomics instead lol.
2018-03-13 09:31:07		she also  said that senior design was gonna be a big time suck and that there would be plenty of times that I would have to meet up with either my team or the teachers outside of class or whatever. 
2018-03-13 09:31:48	jesse	I kinda agree with her. dunno if I will take a summer class or if I will drop working though 
2018-03-13 09:33:22	gjabell	Wait were you thinking of working next semester? Or does she wajt you to drop your internship? 
2018-03-13 09:37:27	jesse	haha not my internship. I've been doing research this semester for $$$ but she wants me to either drop it for the next semester or to drop a class next semester and keep it... Right now, I'm not quite sure what the financially correct option is. 
2018-03-13 09:37:47	gjabell	Oh OK lol 
2018-03-13 09:38:40	jesse	lol if marini told me to drop my internship I would probably scoff and use her computer to lift my advisement hold and leave. 
2018-03-13 09:39:17	gjabell	Lol yeah 
2018-03-16 13:53:02	gjabell	so I was bored and started writing a cli interface for slack using go 
2018-03-16 13:53:22	gjabell	but then I found out someone made a plugin for weechat, which is way more featured than anything I'd end up making 
2018-03-16 13:55:27	gjabell	so now I can move even more of my life to the command line :D 
2018-03-16 13:56:09	jesse	it's the same truth about programming.... everything has already been made haha.  
2018-03-16 13:56:09		so what is weechat? 
2018-03-16 13:56:43	gjabell	yeah xD 
2018-03-16 13:56:46	gjabell	it's an IRC client 
2018-03-16 13:56:53	gjabell	with lots of plugin options 
2018-03-16 13:57:04	jesse	awesome. I miss IRC. 
2018-03-16 13:57:15	gjabell	slack has an IRC gateway but they are decommisioning it 
2018-03-16 13:57:25	gjabell	but this plugin just uses their api so it still works 
2018-03-16 13:57:48	gjabell	https://github.com/wee-slack/wee-slack
2018-03-16 13:57:48		wee-slack/wee-slack

2018-03-16 13:58:47	gjabell	@gjabell uploaded a file: https://sturgill-operators.slack.com/files/U5AUU7HHA/F9R7M593M/2018-03-16-135733_2544x1427_scrot.png (2018-03-16-135733 2544x1427 scrot) 
2018-03-16 13:59:04	gjabell	I think I'm in love 
2018-03-16 13:59:20	jesse	also, what are you gonna do when everything you do is in a terminal? give up i3? 
2018-03-16 13:59:32	gjabell	xD I guess so yeah 
2018-03-16 13:59:40	jesse	omg that is soo coool 
2018-03-16 13:59:43	gjabell	i3 is basically tmux for a ui,so I guess I'll just move to tmux lol 
2018-03-16 13:59:51	gjabell	although web browsing in w3m kinda sucks so idk 
2018-03-16 13:59:55	gjabell	ikr 
2018-03-16 14:00:03	gjabell	it's super easy to setup too 
2018-03-16 14:00:40	jesse	i was gonna play a video game, but you gave my life meaning once more. 
2018-03-16 14:02:56	gjabell	:) 
2018-03-16 14:04:41	gjabell	ofc now I have to go spend a whole weekend exploring all the configuration xD 
2018-03-16 14:09:29	jesse	w3m isnt all that bad if we never needed wolfware or mypack 
2018-03-16 14:09:49	gjabell	that's fair I guess 
2018-03-16 14:09:56	gjabell	navigating is a bit of a pain tho 
2018-03-16 14:10:02	gjabell	at least until you get used to it I imagine 
2018-03-16 14:24:21	jesse	i'm trying to figure out how to message you lol 
2018-03-16 14:25:55	gjabell	worked on my side xD 
2018-03-16 14:26:08	gjabell	did you message me through weechat or the interface 
2018-03-16 14:26:27	jesse	yeah its a bit of a pain right now... I closed out and it looks like i need to go through the registration again. 
2018-03-16 14:26:32	jesse	UI 
2018-03-16 14:26:49	gjabell	oh 
2018-03-16 14:27:07	gjabell	after you register I think you need to do '/save' 
2018-03-16 14:27:16	gjabell	and it'll write it out to the conf file 
2018-03-16 14:27:41	gjabell	also I'd suggest using the secure method they mention if you're going to be committing it to any repos 
2018-03-16 14:27:49	jesse	the config file isn't loading either so I have to manually do that... 
2018-03-16 14:27:54	gjabell	hmm 
2018-03-16 14:27:58	gjabell	how did you configure it? 
2018-03-16 14:28:11	jesse	i just followed the installation instructions 
2018-03-16 14:28:24	gjabell	so wait if you open weechat does it load everything correctly? 
2018-03-16 14:28:38	gjabell	bc originally it wasn't loading the python script for me bc I used python3 instead of 2 
2018-03-16 14:28:42	gjabell	for the websocket-client 
2018-03-16 14:28:50	jesse	that might be it. 
2018-03-16 14:28:56	jesse	it isn't loading 
2018-03-16 14:29:21	gjabell	try installing python2-pip and using pip2 install to get the websocket-client 
2018-03-16 14:29:26	gjabell	that's what worked for me 
2018-03-16 14:30:25	jesse	yeah I have that...why cant people just decide which version of python people should universally use? :disappointed: 
2018-03-16 14:30:42	jesse	or make it back compatible. 
2018-03-16 14:31:06	gjabell	ikr 
2018-03-16 14:31:53	jesse	ok i got it back, but idk how to change the channel to gjabell 
2018-03-16 14:32:17	gjabell	try /buffer [whatever number shows up for me in the sidebar] 
2018-03-16 14:32:42	jesse	:) 
2018-03-16 14:32:45	jesse	:( 
2018-03-16 14:32:49	gjabell	rip xD 
2018-03-16 14:32:50	jesse	testing 
2018-03-16 14:32:54	jesse	yeayy 
2018-03-16 14:32:56	gjabell	woop 
2018-03-16 14:33:17	gjabell	you can switch things in the sidebar with ALT+number, or ALT+arrow keys 
2018-03-16 14:33:23	gjabell	or /buffer number 
2018-03-16 14:33:37	jesse	now we gotta get this running on my raspberry pi so I can ssh into it using my phone... 
2018-03-16 14:33:37	gjabell	or there's a script that let's you matched based on names 
2018-03-16 14:33:41	gjabell	lol xD 
2018-03-16 14:33:45	gjabell	shouldn't be too hard 
2018-03-16 14:34:33	jesse	I'm gonna work on loading my other channels in here. I wonder how this application is memory-wise... cuz the gui takes up loads of memory 
2018-03-16 14:34:47	gjabell	it's probably super minimal 
2018-03-16 14:35:08	gjabell	223M according to htop 
2018-03-16 14:35:31	gjabell	I don't even have the gui installed anymore so I can't check lol 
2018-03-16 14:36:59	jesse	haha i'm removing it now too 
2018-03-16 14:37:50	gjabell	I've been using the web interface bc the app kinda blows on i3 
2018-03-16 14:37:53	gjabell	but fuck that now xD 
2018-03-16 14:38:10		getting channel history...
2018-01-10 16:00:58	jesse	yo 
2018-01-10 16:01:03	gjabell	heyo 
2018-01-10 16:01:10	gjabell	this is going to make my life so much easier xD 
2018-01-10 16:02:29	jesse	I'm glad!! but you graduate some time soonish right? 
2018-01-10 16:02:40	gjabell	probably may 2019 
2018-01-10 16:02:43	gjabell	so a little while 
2018-01-10 16:02:51	jesse	oh ok. December for me 
2018-01-10 16:03:17	gjabell	ah, nice 
2018-01-10 16:04:14	jesse	yeah i don't really know about that ddns stuff. it's fancy talk but I think I understand what it does. 
2018-01-10 16:04:14		i stopped my server until i know what i want to do with it. 
2018-01-10 16:04:33	gjabell	ah 
2018-01-10 16:04:40	gjabell	you know what DNS is, right? 
2018-01-10 16:04:47	gjabell	domain names to IPs 
2018-01-10 16:04:52	jesse	yup 
2018-01-10 16:04:57	gjabell	ddns is dynamic dns 
2018-01-10 16:05:04	jesse	ahh! 
2018-01-10 16:05:06	gjabell	basically, a DNS record only works if you know the ip address of something 
2018-01-10 16:05:18	gjabell	and if you don't have a static IP, the domain will break as soon as your public IP changes 
2018-01-10 16:05:35	gjabell	ddns is basically a service where you can periodically update your DNS to point at your IP 
2018-01-10 16:05:44	gjabell	so even if your IP changes, it will update the DNS server 
2018-01-10 16:05:54	jesse	so why pay for a static ip if you could use ddns? 
2018-01-10 16:06:07	gjabell	really there's no reason xD 
2018-01-10 16:06:14	gjabell	I guess if you were running a DNS server :P 
2018-01-10 16:06:23	gjabell	cause as it turns out 
2018-01-10 16:06:32	gjabell	kinda hard to use DNS if you can't get it from the server xD 
2018-01-10 16:06:37	jesse	lets run a DNS server through DDNS 
2018-01-10 16:06:42	gjabell	lol 
2018-01-10 16:07:03	gjabell	I don't know that many places make you pay for a static ip anymore, not sure tho 
2018-01-10 16:07:07	gjabell	probably depends on the company 
2018-01-10 16:09:17	jesse	why are static ip addresses expensive? 
2018-01-10 16:09:27	gjabell	tbh not really sure 
2018-01-10 16:09:36	gjabell	I guess it probably requires more effort from the company 
2018-01-10 16:09:48	gjabell	dhcp is easy because you can just let a computer handle it 
2018-01-10 16:10:03	gjabell	static ips you need to make sure you don't hand out an ip that's in use 
2018-01-10 16:10:07	jesse	if you use ddns, youre basically taking away multiple possible ips rather than just one.... 
2018-01-10 16:10:31	gjabell	why? 
2018-01-10 16:13:53	jesse	well im kinda thinking about it like a pool of marbles. each one representing an ip address. if people took 1 out and only needed that 1... it would be simple and cheap to distribute... if we had a system of replacing a marble every hour or so, imagine how complex it would be to maintain which ips are used and which arent....  but i know computers are good at that stuff so it doesnt really matter..  
2018-01-10 16:20:29	jesse	point being, i think it would be cheaper to use ip addresses but it isnt. 
2018-01-10 16:25:59	gjabell	I don't think it's actually too difficult, basically there's a computer that keeps track of all assigned ips, and each ip address has a lease time (typically 24 hours or something), once the lease runs out the computer that was assigned the ip requests a new ip, and the computer hands it a new one (or typically the same one it had before unless that's now being used by something else)

2018-02-06 12:46:09	jesse	Hey Galen, have you had to screen-record on linux before? 
2018-02-06 13:24:26	gjabell	I did for the guided project in software engineering 
2018-02-06 13:24:40	gjabell	I think I used obs iirc 
2018-02-06 13:26:31	jesse	haven't tried that one. but all i can get is a black screen with a cursor as output :(
2018-02-06 13:26:31		I'm gonna try getting on a computer at the library and see if my PowerPoint can be opened with sound on there 
2018-02-06 13:26:51	gjabell	weird 
2018-02-06 13:26:55	gjabell	what program are you using 
2018-02-06 13:27:35	jesse	i used screencast, ffmpeg, simplescreenrecorder, and one other one. 
2018-02-06 13:28:31	gjabell	Hmm 
2018-02-06 13:30:44	jesse	why can't teachers just use libreoffice :'( 
2018-02-06 13:30:48	jesse	lol 
2018-02-06 13:31:08	gjabell	Ikr 
2018-03-01 13:27:05	jesse	are you studying any more than what we did on tuesday?

2018-03-01 14:04:42	gjabell	yeah at this point I think I'm just going to let the chips fall where they do 
2018-03-12 18:34:19	gjabell	are you in the data-driven decision making special topics? 
2018-03-12 18:42:29	jesse	i was last semester

2018-03-12 18:43:05	gjabell	do you know if there's reason to take soft. sec. if I'm taking comp. sec. atm 
2018-03-12 19:09:22	jesse	its easier and dr. king 
2018-03-13 07:33:09	gjabell	Fair XD
2018-03-13 07:33:09		Atm it's either that or decision making

2018-03-13 09:28:07	gjabell	All the other electives suxk tho 
2018-03-13 09:28:28	jesse	I'm gonna be taking Human Computer Interaction and soft security 
2018-03-13 09:31:07	jesse	and senior design and I've got 2 other psy classes... I was gonna have cryptography in place of one of those psychology classes but marini said computer science is hard and it would be too much, so I should take Ergonomics instead lol.
2018-03-13 09:31:07		she also  said that senior design was gonna be a big time suck and that there would be plenty of times that I would have to meet up with either my team or the teachers outside of class or whatever.

2018-03-13 09:37:27	jesse	haha not my internship. I've been doing research this semester for $$$ but she wants me to either drop it for the next semester or to drop a class next semester and keep it... Right now, I'm not quite sure what the financially correct option is. 
2018-03-13 09:37:47	gjabell	Oh OK lol 
2018-03-13 09:38:40	jesse	lol if marini told me to drop my internship I would probably scoff and use her computer to lift my advisement hold and leave. 
2018-03-13 09:39:17	gjabell	Lol yeah 
2018-03-16 13:53:02	gjabell	so I was bored and started writing a cli interface for slack using go 
2018-03-16 13:53:22	gjabell	but then I found out someone made a plugin for weechat, which is way more featured than anything I'd end up making 
2018-03-16 13:55:27	gjabell	so now I can move even more of my life to the command line :D 
2018-03-16 13:56:09	jesse	it's the same truth about programming.... everything has already been made haha.  
2018-03-16 13:56:09		so what is weechat? 
2018-03-16 13:56:43	gjabell	yeah xD 
2018-03-16 13:56:46	gjabell	it's an IRC client 
2018-03-16 13:56:53	gjabell	with lots of plugin options 
2018-03-16 13:57:04	jesse	awesome. I miss IRC. 
2018-03-16 13:57:15	gjabell	slack has an IRC gateway but they are decommisioning it 
2018-03-16 13:57:25	gjabell	but this plugin just uses their api so it still works

2018-03-16 13:59:04	gjabell	I think I'm in love 
2018-03-16 13:59:20	jesse	also, what are you gonna do when everything you do is in a terminal? give up i3? 
2018-03-16 13:59:32	gjabell	xD I guess so yeah 
2018-03-16 13:59:40	jesse	omg that is soo coool 
2018-03-16 13:59:43	gjabell	i3 is basically tmux for a ui,so I guess I'll just move to tmux lol 
2018-03-16 13:59:51	gjabell	although web browsing in w3m kinda sucks so idk 
2018-03-16 13:59:55	gjabell	ikr 
2018-03-16 14:00:03	gjabell	it's super easy to setup too 
2018-03-16 14:00:40	jesse	i was gonna play a video game, but you gave my life meaning once more. 
2018-03-16 14:02:56	gjabell	:) 
2018-03-16 14:04:41	gjabell	ofc now I have to go spend a whole weekend exploring all the configuration xD 
2018-03-16 14:09:29	jesse	w3m isnt all that bad if we never needed wolfware or mypack 
2018-03-16 14:09:49	gjabell	that's fair I guess 
2018-03-16 14:09:56	gjabell	navigating is a bit of a pain tho 
2018-03-16 14:10:02	gjabell	at least until you get used to it I imagine 
2018-03-16 14:24:21	jesse	i'm trying to figure out how to message you lol 
2018-03-16 14:25:55	gjabell	worked on my side xD 
2018-03-16 14:26:08	gjabell	did you message me through weechat or the interface 
2018-03-16 14:26:27	jesse	yeah its a bit of a pain right now... I closed out and it looks like i need to go through the registration again. 
2018-03-16 14:26:32	jesse	UI 
2018-03-16 14:26:49	gjabell	oh 
2018-03-16 14:27:07	gjabell	after you register I think you need to do '/save' 
2018-03-16 14:27:16	gjabell	and it'll write it out to the conf file 
2018-03-16 14:27:41	gjabell	also I'd suggest using the secure method they mention if you're going to be committing it to any repos 
2018-03-16 14:27:49	jesse	the config file isn't loading either so I have to manually do that... 
2018-03-16 14:27:54	gjabell	hmm 
2018-03-16 14:27:58	gjabell	how did you configure it? 
2018-03-16 14:28:11	jesse	i just followed the installation instructions 
2018-03-16 14:28:24	gjabell	so wait if you open weechat does it load everything correctly? 
2018-03-16 14:28:38	gjabell	bc originally it wasn't loading the python script for me bc I used python3 instead of 2 
2018-03-16 14:28:42	gjabell	for the websocket-client 
2018-03-16 14:28:50	jesse	that might be it. 
2018-03-16 14:28:56	jesse	it isn't loading 
2018-03-16 14:29:21	gjabell	try installing python2-pip and using pip2 install to get the websocket-client 
2018-03-16 14:29:26	gjabell	that's what worked for me 
2018-03-16 14:30:25	jesse	yeah I have that...why cant people just decide which version of python people should universally use? :disappointed: 
2018-03-16 14:30:42	jesse	or make it back compatible. 
2018-03-16 14:31:06	gjabell	ikr 
2018-03-16 14:31:53	jesse	ok i got it back, but idk how to change the channel to gjabell 
2018-03-16 14:32:17	gjabell	try /buffer [whatever number shows up for me in the sidebar] 
2018-03-16 14:32:42	jesse	:) 
2018-03-16 14:32:45	jesse	:( 
2018-03-16 14:32:49	gjabell	rip xD 
2018-03-16 14:32:50	jesse	testing 
2018-03-16 14:32:54	jesse	yeayy 
2018-03-16 14:32:56	gjabell	woop 
2018-03-16 14:33:17	gjabell	you can switch things in the sidebar with ALT+number, or ALT+arrow keys 
2018-03-16 14:33:23	gjabell	or /buffer number 
2018-03-16 14:33:37	jesse	now we gotta get this running on my raspberry pi so I can ssh into it using my phone... 
2018-03-16 14:33:37	gjabell	or there's a script that let's you matched based on names 
2018-03-16 14:33:41	gjabell	lol xD 
2018-03-16 14:33:45	gjabell	shouldn't be too hard 
2018-03-16 14:34:33	jesse	I'm gonna work on loading my other channels in here. I wonder how this application is memory-wise... cuz the gui takes up loads of memory 
2018-03-16 14:34:47	gjabell	it's probably super minimal 
2018-03-16 14:35:08	gjabell	223M according to htop 
2018-03-16 14:35:31	gjabell	I don't even have the gui installed anymore so I can't check lol 
2018-03-16 14:36:59	jesse	haha i'm removing it now too 
2018-03-16 14:37:50	gjabell	I've been using the web interface bc the app kinda blows on i3 
2018-03-16 14:37:53	gjabell	but fuck that now xD 
2018-03-16 14:40:42	jesse	it is a lil hard to manage multiple channels though 
2018-03-16 14:41:01	gjabell	idk I don't think it's too bad 
2018-03-16 14:41:14	gjabell	you just have to remember which channel comes from which server 
2018-03-16 14:41:21	gjabell	or are you talking about something else 
2018-03-16 14:42:05	jesse	I added the 3 channels I was apart of. my sidebar is pretty cluttered and I'm not sure which people correspond to which channel... since there are duplicates 
2018-03-16 14:42:13	gjabell	ah 
2018-03-16 14:42:22	gjabell	if you open a channel you can type /close and it'll go away from teh sidebar 
2018-03-16 14:38:10		getting channel history...
2018-03-16 14:42:38	gjabell	there also might be a way to tag things based on the server 
2018-01-10 16:00:58	jesse	yo 
2018-01-10 16:01:03	gjabell	heyo 
2018-01-10 16:01:10	gjabell	this is going to make my life so much easier xD 
2018-01-10 16:02:29	jesse	I'm glad!! but you graduate some time soonish right? 
2018-01-10 16:02:40	gjabell	probably may 2019 
2018-01-10 16:02:43	gjabell	so a little while 
2018-01-10 16:02:51	jesse	oh ok. December for me 
2018-01-10 16:03:17	gjabell	ah, nice 
2018-01-10 16:04:14	jesse	yeah i don't really know about that ddns stuff. it's fancy talk but I think I understand what it does. 
2018-01-10 16:04:14		i stopped my server until i know what i want to do with it. 
2018-01-10 16:04:33	gjabell	ah 
2018-01-10 16:04:40	gjabell	you know what DNS is, right? 
2018-01-10 16:04:47	gjabell	domain names to IPs 
2018-01-10 16:04:52	jesse	yup 
2018-01-10 16:04:57	gjabell	ddns is dynamic dns 
2018-01-10 16:05:04	jesse	ahh! 
2018-01-10 16:05:06	gjabell	basically, a DNS record only works if you know the ip address of something 
2018-01-10 16:05:18	gjabell	and if you don't have a static IP, the domain will break as soon as your public IP changes 
2018-01-10 16:05:35	gjabell	ddns is basically a service where you can periodically update your DNS to point at your IP 
2018-01-10 16:05:44	gjabell	so even if your IP changes, it will update the DNS server 
2018-01-10 16:05:54	jesse	so why pay for a static ip if you could use ddns? 
2018-01-10 16:06:07	gjabell	really there's no reason xD 
2018-01-10 16:06:14	gjabell	I guess if you were running a DNS server :P 
2018-01-10 16:06:23	gjabell	cause as it turns out 
2018-01-10 16:06:32	gjabell	kinda hard to use DNS if you can't get it from the server xD 
2018-01-10 16:06:37	jesse	lets run a DNS server through DDNS 
2018-01-10 16:06:42	gjabell	lol 
2018-01-10 16:07:03	gjabell	I don't know that many places make you pay for a static ip anymore, not sure tho 
2018-01-10 16:07:07	gjabell	probably depends on the company 
2018-01-10 16:09:17	jesse	why are static ip addresses expensive? 
2018-01-10 16:09:27	gjabell	tbh not really sure 
2018-01-10 16:09:36	gjabell	I guess it probably requires more effort from the company 
2018-01-10 16:09:48	gjabell	dhcp is easy because you can just let a computer handle it 
2018-01-10 16:10:03	gjabell	static ips you need to make sure you don't hand out an ip that's in use 
2018-01-10 16:10:07	jesse	if you use ddns, youre basically taking away multiple possible ips rather than just one.... 
2018-01-10 16:10:31	gjabell	why? 
2018-01-10 16:13:53	jesse	well im kinda thinking about it like a pool of marbles. each one representing an ip address. if people took 1 out and only needed that 1... it would be simple and cheap to distribute... if we had a system of replacing a marble every hour or so, imagine how complex it would be to maintain which ips are used and which arent....  but i know computers are good at that stuff so it doesnt really matter..  
2018-01-10 16:20:29	jesse	point being, i think it would be cheaper to use ip addresses but it isnt. 
2018-01-10 16:25:59	gjabell	I don't think it's actually too difficult, basically there's a computer that keeps track of all assigned ips, and each ip address has a lease time (typically 24 hours or something), once the lease runs out the computer that was assigned the ip requests a new ip, and the computer hands it a new one (or typically the same one it had before unless that's now being used by something else)

2018-02-06 12:46:09	jesse	Hey Galen, have you had to screen-record on linux before? 
2018-02-06 13:24:26	gjabell	I did for the guided project in software engineering 
2018-02-06 13:24:40	gjabell	I think I used obs iirc 
2018-02-06 13:26:31	jesse	haven't tried that one. but all i can get is a black screen with a cursor as output :(
2018-02-06 13:26:31		I'm gonna try getting on a computer at the library and see if my PowerPoint can be opened with sound on there 
2018-02-06 13:26:51	gjabell	weird 
2018-02-06 13:26:55	gjabell	what program are you using 
2018-02-06 13:27:35	jesse	i used screencast, ffmpeg, simplescreenrecorder, and one other one. 
2018-02-06 13:28:31	gjabell	Hmm 
2018-02-06 13:30:44	jesse	why can't teachers just use libreoffice :'( 
2018-02-06 13:30:48	jesse	lol 
2018-02-06 13:31:08	gjabell	Ikr 
2018-03-01 13:27:05	jesse	are you studying any more than what we did on tuesday? 
2018-03-01 14:01:53	gjabell	I went over review 6 again bc that was the one I had the most trouble with 
2018-03-01 14:01:59	gjabell	didn't do much other than that tho 
2018-03-01 14:04:24	jesse	gotcha. I'm probably not gonna touch the material. 
2018-03-01 14:04:42	gjabell	yeah at this point I think I'm just going to let the chips fall where they do 
2018-03-12 18:34:19	gjabell	are you in the data-driven decision making special topics? 
2018-03-12 18:42:29	jesse	i was last semester 
2018-03-12 18:42:39	gjabell	was it fun 
2018-03-12 18:42:41	jesse	good easy A that got me a job that I am currently working. 
2018-03-12 18:42:52	jesse	all python 
2018-03-12 18:42:52	gjabell	seems good then, I might take it next semester 
2018-03-12 18:43:05	gjabell	do you know if there's reason to take soft. sec. if I'm taking comp. sec. atm 
2018-03-12 19:09:22	jesse	its easier and dr. king 
2018-03-13 07:33:09	gjabell	Fair XD
2018-03-13 07:33:09		Atm it's either that or decision making 
2018-03-13 09:19:16	jesse	take them both. surely theres another csc course you could get rid of? 
2018-03-13 09:22:26	gjabell	Well, I'm taking databases as my restricted elective, so I was going to take one of those two as an 'other elective'
2018-03-13 09:22:26		Plus I kinda figure I shoudlnt overload too much on csc since I want to take senior design 
2018-03-13 09:26:04	jesse	Ms. Marini told me to take other restricted electives that were not computer science cuz she thought I was gonna overwork myself with senior design. 
2018-03-13 09:26:29	jesse	she also wants me to either take a class over the summer or not work... :disappointed: 
2018-03-13 09:26:49	gjabell	Lol why 
2018-03-13 09:28:07	gjabell	All the other electives suxk tho 
2018-03-13 09:28:28	jesse	I'm gonna be taking Human Computer Interaction and soft security 
2018-03-13 09:31:07	jesse	and senior design and I've got 2 other psy classes... I was gonna have cryptography in place of one of those psychology classes but marini said computer science is hard and it would be too much, so I should take Ergonomics instead lol.
2018-03-13 09:31:07		she also  said that senior design was gonna be a big time suck and that there would be plenty of times that I would have to meet up with either my team or the teachers outside of class or whatever. 
2018-03-13 09:31:48	jesse	I kinda agree with her. dunno if I will take a summer class or if I will drop working though 
2018-03-13 09:33:22	gjabell	Wait were you thinking of working next semester? Or does she wajt you to drop your internship? 
2018-03-13 09:37:27	jesse	haha not my internship. I've been doing research this semester for $$$ but she wants me to either drop it for the next semester or to drop a class next semester and keep it... Right now, I'm not quite sure what the financially correct option is. 
2018-03-13 09:37:47	gjabell	Oh OK lol 
2018-03-13 09:38:40	jesse	lol if marini told me to drop my internship I would probably scoff and use her computer to lift my advisement hold and leave. 
2018-03-13 09:39:17	gjabell	Lol yeah 
2018-03-16 13:53:02	gjabell	so I was bored and started writing a cli interface for slack using go 
2018-03-16 13:53:22	gjabell	but then I found out someone made a plugin for weechat, which is way more featured than anything I'd end up making

2018-03-16 14:24:21	jesse	i'm trying to figure out how to message you lol 
2018-03-16 14:25:55	gjabell	worked on my side xD 
2018-03-16 14:26:08	gjabell	did you message me through weechat or the interface 
2018-03-16 14:26:27	jesse	yeah its a bit of a pain right now... I closed out and it looks like i need to go through the registration again. 
2018-03-16 14:26:32	jesse	UI 
2018-03-16 14:26:49	gjabell	oh 
2018-03-16 14:27:07	gjabell	after you register I think you need to do '/save' 
2018-03-16 14:27:16	gjabell	and it'll write it out to the conf file 
2018-03-16 14:27:41	gjabell	also I'd suggest using the secure method they mention if you're going to be committing it to any repos 
2018-03-16 14:27:49	jesse	the config file isn't loading either so I have to manually do that... 
2018-03-16 14:27:54	gjabell	hmm 
2018-03-16 14:27:58	gjabell	how did you configure it? 
2018-03-16 14:28:11	jesse	i just followed the installation instructions 
2018-03-16 14:28:24	gjabell	so wait if you open weechat does it load everything correctly? 
2018-03-16 14:28:38	gjabell	bc originally it wasn't loading the python script for me bc I used python3 instead of 2 
2018-03-16 14:28:42	gjabell	for the websocket-client 
2018-03-16 14:28:50	jesse	that might be it. 
2018-03-16 14:28:56	jesse	it isn't loading 
2018-03-16 14:29:21	gjabell	try installing python2-pip and using pip2 install to get the websocket-client 
2018-03-16 14:29:26	gjabell	that's what worked for me 
2018-03-16 14:30:25	jesse	yeah I have that...why cant people just decide which version of python people should universally use? :disappointed: 
2018-03-16 14:30:42	jesse	or make it back compatible. 
2018-03-16 14:31:06	gjabell	ikr 
2018-03-16 14:31:53	jesse	ok i got it back, but idk how to change the channel to gjabell 
2018-03-16 14:32:17	gjabell	try /buffer [whatever number shows up for me in the sidebar] 
2018-03-16 14:32:42	jesse	:) 
2018-03-16 14:32:45	jesse	:( 
2018-03-16 14:32:49	gjabell	rip xD 
2018-03-16 14:32:50	jesse	testing 
2018-03-16 14:32:54	jesse	yeayy 
2018-03-16 14:32:56	gjabell	woop 
2018-03-16 14:33:17	gjabell	you can switch things in the sidebar with ALT+number, or ALT+arrow keys 
2018-03-16 14:33:23	gjabell	or /buffer number 
2018-03-16 14:33:37	jesse	now we gotta get this running on my raspberry pi so I can ssh into it using my phone... 
2018-03-16 14:33:37	gjabell	or there's a script that let's you matched based on names 
2018-03-16 14:33:41	gjabell	lol xD 
2018-03-16 14:33:45	gjabell	shouldn't be too hard 
2018-03-16 14:34:33	jesse	I'm gonna work on loading my other channels in here. I wonder how this application is memory-wise... cuz the gui takes up loads of memory 
2018-03-16 14:34:47	gjabell	it's probably super minimal 
2018-03-16 14:35:08	gjabell	223M according to htop 
2018-03-16 14:35:31	gjabell	I don't even have the gui installed anymore so I can't check lol 
2018-03-16 14:36:59	jesse	haha i'm removing it now too 
2018-03-16 14:37:50	gjabell	I've been using the web interface bc the app kinda blows on i3 
2018-03-16 14:37:53	gjabell	but fuck that now xD 
2018-03-16 14:40:42	jesse	it is a lil hard to manage multiple channels though 
2018-03-16 14:41:01	gjabell	idk I don't think it's too bad 
2018-03-16 14:41:14	gjabell	you just have to remember which channel comes from which server 
2018-03-16 14:41:21	gjabell	or are you talking about something else 
2018-03-16 14:42:05	jesse	I added the 3 channels I was apart of. my sidebar is pretty cluttered and I'm not sure which people correspond to which channel... since there are duplicates 
2018-03-16 14:42:13	gjabell	ah 
2018-03-16 14:42:22	gjabell	if you open a channel you can type /close and it'll go away from teh sidebar 
2018-03-16 14:42:38	gjabell	there also might be a way to tag things based on the server 
2018-03-16 14:43:52	gjabell	now I just have to get facebook messenger working on this and i'll never need a web-based chat again xD 
2018-03-16 14:49:54	jesse	haha nice 
2018-03-16 14:45:27		getting channel history...
2018-01-10 16:00:58	jesse	yo 
2018-01-10 16:01:03	gjabell	heyo 
2018-01-10 16:01:10	gjabell	this is going to make my life so much easier xD 
2018-01-10 16:02:29	jesse	I'm glad!! but you graduate some time soonish right? 
2018-01-10 16:02:40	gjabell	probably may 2019 
2018-01-10 16:02:43	gjabell	so a little while 
2018-01-10 16:02:51	jesse	oh ok. December for me 
2018-01-10 16:03:17	gjabell	ah, nice 
2018-01-10 16:04:14	jesse	yeah i don't really know about that ddns stuff. it's fancy talk but I think I understand what it does. 
2018-01-10 16:04:14		i stopped my server until i know what i want to do with it. 
2018-01-10 16:04:33	gjabell	ah 
2018-01-10 16:04:40	gjabell	you know what DNS is, right? 
2018-01-10 16:04:47	gjabell	domain names to IPs 
2018-01-10 16:04:52	jesse	yup 
2018-01-10 16:04:57	gjabell	ddns is dynamic dns 
2018-01-10 16:05:04	jesse	ahh! 
2018-01-10 16:05:06	gjabell	basically, a DNS record only works if you know the ip address of something 
2018-01-10 16:05:18	gjabell	and if you don't have a static IP, the domain will break as soon as your public IP changes 
2018-01-10 16:05:35	gjabell	ddns is basically a service where you can periodically update your DNS to point at your IP 
2018-01-10 16:05:44	gjabell	so even if your IP changes, it will update the DNS server 
2018-01-10 16:05:54	jesse	so why pay for a static ip if you could use ddns? 
2018-01-10 16:06:07	gjabell	really there's no reason xD 
2018-01-10 16:06:14	gjabell	I guess if you were running a DNS server :P 
2018-01-10 16:06:23	gjabell	cause as it turns out 
2018-01-10 16:06:32	gjabell	kinda hard to use DNS if you can't get it from the server xD 
2018-01-10 16:06:37	jesse	lets run a DNS server through DDNS 
2018-01-10 16:06:42	gjabell	lol 
2018-01-10 16:07:03	gjabell	I don't know that many places make you pay for a static ip anymore, not sure tho 
2018-01-10 16:07:07	gjabell	probably depends on the company 
2018-01-10 16:09:17	jesse	why are static ip addresses expensive? 
2018-01-10 16:09:27	gjabell	tbh not really sure 
2018-01-10 16:09:36	gjabell	I guess it probably requires more effort from the company 
2018-01-10 16:09:48	gjabell	dhcp is easy because you can just let a computer handle it 
2018-01-10 16:10:03	gjabell	static ips you need to make sure you don't hand out an ip that's in use 
2018-01-10 16:10:07	jesse	if you use ddns, youre basically taking away multiple possible ips rather than just one.... 
2018-01-10 16:10:31	gjabell	why? 
2018-01-10 16:13:53	jesse	well im kinda thinking about it like a pool of marbles. each one representing an ip address. if people took 1 out and only needed that 1... it would be simple and cheap to distribute... if we had a system of replacing a marble every hour or so, imagine how complex it would be to maintain which ips are used and which arent....  but i know computers are good at that stuff so it doesnt really matter..  
2018-01-10 16:20:29	jesse	point being, i think it would be cheaper to use ip addresses but it isnt. 
2018-01-10 16:25:59	gjabell	I don't think it's actually too difficult, basically there's a computer that keeps track of all assigned ips, and each ip address has a lease time (typically 24 hours or something), once the lease runs out the computer that was assigned the ip requests a new ip, and the computer hands it a new one (or typically the same one it had before unless that's now being used by something else) 
2018-01-24 09:45:02	gjabell	@gjabell uploaded a file: https://sturgill-operators.slack.com/files/U5AUU7HHA/F8Y12EN13/references.pdf (references.pdf) 
2018-02-06 12:46:09	jesse	Hey Galen, have you had to screen-record on linux before? 
2018-02-06 13:24:26	gjabell	I did for the guided project in software engineering 
2018-02-06 13:24:40	gjabell	I think I used obs iirc 
2018-02-06 13:26:31	jesse	haven't tried that one. but all i can get is a black screen with a cursor as output :(
2018-02-06 13:26:31		I'm gonna try getting on a computer at the library and see if my PowerPoint can be opened with sound on there 
2018-02-06 13:26:51	gjabell	weird 
2018-02-06 13:26:55	gjabell	what program are you using 
2018-02-06 13:27:35	jesse	i used screencast, ffmpeg, simplescreenrecorder, and one other one. 
2018-02-06 13:28:31	gjabell	Hmm 
2018-02-06 13:30:44	jesse	why can't teachers just use libreoffice :'( 
2018-02-06 13:30:48	jesse	lol 
2018-02-06 13:31:08	gjabell	Ikr 
2018-03-01 13:27:05	jesse	are you studying any more than what we did on tuesday? 
2018-03-01 14:01:53	gjabell	I went over review 6 again bc that was the one I had the most trouble with 
2018-03-01 14:01:59	gjabell	didn't do much other than that tho 
2018-03-01 14:04:24	jesse	gotcha. I'm probably not gonna touch the material. 
2018-03-01 14:04:42	gjabell	yeah at this point I think I'm just going to let the chips fall where they do 
2018-03-12 18:34:19	gjabell	are you in the data-driven decision making special topics? 
2018-03-12 18:42:29	jesse	i was last semester 
2018-03-12 18:42:39	gjabell	was it fun 
2018-03-12 18:42:41	jesse	good easy A that got me a job that I am currently working. 
2018-03-12 18:42:52	jesse	all python 
2018-03-12 18:42:52	gjabell	seems good then, I might take it next semester 
2018-03-12 18:43:05	gjabell	do you know if there's reason to take soft. sec. if I'm taking comp. sec. atm 
2018-03-12 19:09:22	jesse	its easier and dr. king 
2018-03-13 07:33:09	gjabell	Fair XD
2018-03-13 07:33:09		Atm it's either that or decision making 
2018-03-13 09:19:16	jesse	take them both. surely theres another csc course you could get rid of? 
2018-03-13 09:22:26	gjabell	Well, I'm taking databases as my restricted elective, so I was going to take one of those two as an 'other elective'
2018-03-13 09:22:26		Plus I kinda figure I shoudlnt overload too much on csc since I want to take senior design 
2018-03-13 09:26:04	jesse	Ms. Marini told me to take other restricted electives that were not computer science cuz she thought I was gonna overwork myself with senior design. 
2018-03-13 09:26:29	jesse	she also wants me to either take a class over the summer or not work... :disappointed: 
2018-03-13 09:26:49	gjabell	Lol why 
2018-03-13 09:28:07	gjabell	All the other electives suxk tho 
2018-03-13 09:28:28	jesse	I'm gonna be taking Human Computer Interaction and soft security 
2018-03-13 09:31:07	jesse	and senior design and I've got 2 other psy classes... I was gonna have cryptography in place of one of those psychology classes but marini said computer science is hard and it would be too much, so I should take Ergonomics instead lol.
2018-03-13 09:31:07		she also  said that senior design was gonna be a big time suck and that there would be plenty of times that I would have to meet up with either my team or the teachers outside of class or whatever. 
2018-03-13 09:31:48	jesse	I kinda agree with her. dunno if I will take a summer class or if I will drop working though 
2018-03-13 09:33:22	gjabell	Wait were you thinking of working next semester? Or does she wajt you to drop your internship? 
2018-03-13 09:37:27	jesse	haha not my internship. I've been doing research this semester for $$$ but she wants me to either drop it for the next semester or to drop a class next semester and keep it... Right now, I'm not quite sure what the financially correct option is. 
2018-03-13 09:37:47	gjabell	Oh OK lol 
2018-03-13 09:38:40	jesse	lol if marini told me to drop my internship I would probably scoff and use her computer to lift my advisement hold and leave. 
2018-03-13 09:39:17	gjabell	Lol yeah 
2018-03-16 13:53:02	gjabell	so I was bored and started writing a cli interface for slack using go 
2018-03-16 13:53:22	gjabell	but then I found out someone made a plugin for weechat, which is way more featured than anything I'd end up making 
2018-03-16 13:55:27	gjabell	so now I can move even more of my life to the command line :D 
2018-03-16 13:56:09	jesse	it's the same truth about programming.... everything has already been made haha.  
2018-03-16 13:56:09		so what is weechat? 
2018-03-16 13:56:43	gjabell	yeah xD 
2018-03-16 13:56:46	gjabell	it's an IRC client 
2018-03-16 13:56:53	gjabell	with lots of plugin options 
2018-03-16 13:57:04	jesse	awesome. I miss IRC. 
2018-03-16 13:57:15	gjabell	slack has an IRC gateway but they are decommisioning it 
2018-03-16 13:57:25	gjabell	but this plugin just uses their api so it still works 
2018-03-16 13:57:48	gjabell	https://github.com/wee-slack/wee-slack

2018-03-16 13:59:20	jesse	also, what are you gonna do when everything you do is in a terminal? give up i3? 
2018-03-16 13:59:32	gjabell	xD I guess so yeah 
2018-03-16 13:59:40	jesse	omg that is soo coool 
2018-03-16 13:59:43	gjabell	i3 is basically tmux for a ui,so I guess I'll just move to tmux lol 
2018-03-16 13:59:51	gjabell	although web browsing in w3m kinda sucks so idk 
2018-03-16 13:59:55	gjabell	ikr 
2018-03-16 14:00:03	gjabell	it's super easy to setup too 
2018-03-16 14:00:40	jesse	i was gonna play a video game, but you gave my life meaning once more. 
2018-03-16 14:02:56	gjabell	:) 
2018-03-16 14:04:41	gjabell	ofc now I have to go spend a whole weekend exploring all the configuration xD 
2018-03-16 14:09:29	jesse	w3m isnt all that bad if we never needed wolfware or mypack 
2018-03-16 14:09:49	gjabell	that's fair I guess 
2018-03-16 14:09:56	gjabell	navigating is a bit of a pain tho 
2018-03-16 14:10:02	gjabell	at least until you get used to it I imagine 
2018-03-16 14:24:21	jesse	i'm trying to figure out how to message you lol 
2018-03-16 14:25:55	gjabell	worked on my side xD 
2018-03-16 14:26:08	gjabell	did you message me through weechat or the interface 
2018-03-16 14:26:27	jesse	yeah its a bit of a pain right now... I closed out and it looks like i need to go through the registration again. 
2018-03-16 14:26:32	jesse	UI 
2018-03-16 14:26:49	gjabell	oh 
2018-03-16 14:27:07	gjabell	after you register I think you need to do '/save' 
2018-03-16 14:27:16	gjabell	and it'll write it out to the conf file 
2018-03-16 14:27:41	gjabell	also I'd suggest using the secure method they mention if you're going to be committing it to any repos 
2018-03-16 14:27:49	jesse	the config file isn't loading either so I have to manually do that... 
2018-03-16 14:27:54	gjabell	hmm 
2018-03-16 14:27:58	gjabell	how did you configure it? 
2018-03-16 14:28:11	jesse	i just followed the installation instructions

2018-03-16 14:30:25	jesse	yeah I have that...why cant people just decide which version of python people should universally use? :disappointed: 
2018-03-16 14:30:42	jesse	or make it back compatible. 
2018-03-16 14:31:06	gjabell	ikr 
2018-03-16 14:31:53	jesse	ok i got it back, but idk how to change the channel to gjabell

2018-03-16 14:33:17	gjabell	you can switch things in the sidebar with ALT+number, or ALT+arrow keys 
2018-03-16 14:33:23	gjabell	or /buffer number 
2018-03-16 14:33:37	jesse	now we gotta get this running on my raspberry pi so I can ssh into it using my phone... 
2018-03-16 14:33:37	gjabell	or there's a script that let's you matched based on names 
2018-03-16 14:33:41	gjabell	lol xD 
2018-03-16 14:33:45	gjabell	shouldn't be too hard 
2018-03-16 14:34:33	jesse	I'm gonna work on loading my other channels in here. I wonder how this application is memory-wise... cuz the gui takes up loads of memory 
2018-03-16 14:34:47	gjabell	it's probably super minimal 
2018-03-16 14:35:08	gjabell	223M according to htop 
2018-03-16 14:35:31	gjabell	I don't even have the gui installed anymore so I can't check lol 
2018-03-16 14:36:59	jesse	haha i'm removing it now too 
2018-03-16 14:37:50	gjabell	I've been using the web interface bc the app kinda blows on i3 
2018-03-16 14:37:53	gjabell	but fuck that now xD 
2018-03-16 14:40:42	jesse	it is a lil hard to manage multiple channels though 
2018-03-16 14:41:01	gjabell	idk I don't think it's too bad 
2018-03-16 14:41:14	gjabell	you just have to remember which channel comes from which server 
2018-03-16 14:41:21	gjabell	or are you talking about something else 
2018-03-16 14:42:05	jesse	I added the 3 channels I was apart of. my sidebar is pretty cluttered and I'm not sure which people correspond to which channel... since there are duplicates 
2018-03-16 14:42:13	gjabell	ah 
2018-03-16 14:42:22	gjabell	if you open a channel you can type /close and it'll go away from teh sidebar 
2018-03-16 14:42:38	gjabell	there also might be a way to tag things based on the server 
2018-03-16 14:43:52	gjabell	now I just have to get facebook messenger working on this and i'll never need a web-based chat again xD 
2018-03-16 14:49:54	jesse	haha nice 
2018-03-16 15:00:22		getting channel history...
2018-01-10 16:00:58	jesse	yo 
2018-01-10 16:01:03	gjabell	heyo 
2018-01-10 16:01:10	gjabell	this is going to make my life so much easier xD 
2018-01-10 16:02:29	jesse	I'm glad!! but you graduate some time soonish right? 
2018-01-10 16:02:40	gjabell	probably may 2019 
2018-01-10 16:02:43	gjabell	so a little while 
2018-01-10 16:02:51	jesse	oh ok. December for me 
2018-01-10 16:03:17	gjabell	ah, nice 
2018-01-10 16:04:14	jesse	yeah i don't really know about that ddns stuff. it's fancy talk but I think I understand what it does. 
2018-01-10 16:04:14		i stopped my server until i know what i want to do with it. 
2018-01-10 16:04:33	gjabell	ah 
2018-01-10 16:04:40	gjabell	you know what DNS is, right? 
2018-01-10 16:04:47	gjabell	domain names to IPs 
2018-01-10 16:04:52	jesse	yup 
2018-01-10 16:04:57	gjabell	ddns is dynamic dns 
2018-01-10 16:05:04	jesse	ahh! 
2018-01-10 16:05:06	gjabell	basically, a DNS record only works if you know the ip address of something 
2018-01-10 16:05:18	gjabell	and if you don't have a static IP, the domain will break as soon as your public IP changes 
2018-01-10 16:05:35	gjabell	ddns is basically a service where you can periodically update your DNS to point at your IP 
2018-01-10 16:05:44	gjabell	so even if your IP changes, it will update the DNS server 
2018-01-10 16:05:54	jesse	so why pay for a static ip if you could use ddns? 
2018-01-10 16:06:07	gjabell	really there's no reason xD 
2018-01-10 16:06:14	gjabell	I guess if you were running a DNS server :P 
2018-01-10 16:06:23	gjabell	cause as it turns out 
2018-01-10 16:06:32	gjabell	kinda hard to use DNS if you can't get it from the server xD 
2018-01-10 16:06:37	jesse	lets run a DNS server through DDNS 
2018-01-10 16:06:42	gjabell	lol 
2018-01-10 16:07:03	gjabell	I don't know that many places make you pay for a static ip anymore, not sure tho 
2018-01-10 16:07:07	gjabell	probably depends on the company 
2018-01-10 16:09:17	jesse	why are static ip addresses expensive? 
2018-01-10 16:09:27	gjabell	tbh not really sure 
2018-01-10 16:09:36	gjabell	I guess it probably requires more effort from the company 
2018-01-10 16:09:48	gjabell	dhcp is easy because you can just let a computer handle it 
2018-01-10 16:10:03	gjabell	static ips you need to make sure you don't hand out an ip that's in use 
2018-01-10 16:10:07	jesse	if you use ddns, youre basically taking away multiple possible ips rather than just one.... 
2018-01-10 16:10:31	gjabell	why? 
2018-01-10 16:13:53	jesse	well im kinda thinking about it like a pool of marbles. each one representing an ip address. if people took 1 out and only needed that 1... it would be simple and cheap to distribute... if we had a system of replacing a marble every hour or so, imagine how complex it would be to maintain which ips are used and which arent....  but i know computers are good at that stuff so it doesnt really matter..  
2018-01-10 16:20:29	jesse	point being, i think it would be cheaper to use ip addresses but it isnt. 
2018-01-10 16:25:59	gjabell	I don't think it's actually too difficult, basically there's a computer that keeps track of all assigned ips, and each ip address has a lease time (typically 24 hours or something), once the lease runs out the computer that was assigned the ip requests a new ip, and the computer hands it a new one (or typically the same one it had before unless that's now being used by something else) 
2018-01-24 09:45:02	gjabell	@gjabell uploaded a file: https://sturgill-operators.slack.com/files/U5AUU7HHA/F8Y12EN13/references.pdf (references.pdf) 
2018-02-06 12:46:09	jesse	Hey Galen, have you had to screen-record on linux before? 
2018-02-06 13:24:26	gjabell	I did for the guided project in software engineering 
2018-02-06 13:24:40	gjabell	I think I used obs iirc 
2018-02-06 13:26:31	jesse	haven't tried that one. but all i can get is a black screen with a cursor as output :(
2018-02-06 13:26:31		I'm gonna try getting on a computer at the library and see if my PowerPoint can be opened with sound on there 
2018-02-06 13:26:51	gjabell	weird 
2018-02-06 13:26:55	gjabell	what program are you using 
2018-02-06 13:27:35	jesse	i used screencast, ffmpeg, simplescreenrecorder, and one other one. 
2018-02-06 13:28:31	gjabell	Hmm 
2018-02-06 13:30:44	jesse	why can't teachers just use libreoffice :'( 
2018-02-06 13:30:48	jesse	lol 
2018-02-06 13:31:08	gjabell	Ikr 
2018-03-01 13:27:05	jesse	are you studying any more than what we did on tuesday? 
2018-03-01 14:01:53	gjabell	I went over review 6 again bc that was the one I had the most trouble with 
2018-03-01 14:01:59	gjabell	didn't do much other than that tho 
2018-03-01 14:04:24	jesse	gotcha. I'm probably not gonna touch the material. 
2018-03-01 14:04:42	gjabell	yeah at this point I think I'm just going to let the chips fall where they do 
2018-03-12 18:34:19	gjabell	are you in the data-driven decision making special topics? 
2018-03-12 18:42:29	jesse	i was last semester 
2018-03-12 18:42:39	gjabell	was it fun 
2018-03-12 18:42:41	jesse	good easy A that got me a job that I am currently working. 
2018-03-12 18:42:52	jesse	all python 
2018-03-12 18:42:52	gjabell	seems good then, I might take it next semester 
2018-03-12 18:43:05	gjabell	do you know if there's reason to take soft. sec. if I'm taking comp. sec. atm 
2018-03-12 19:09:22	jesse	its easier and dr. king 
2018-03-13 07:33:09	gjabell	Fair XD
2018-03-13 07:33:09		Atm it's either that or decision making 
2018-03-13 09:19:16	jesse	take them both. surely theres another csc course you could get rid of? 
2018-03-13 09:22:26	gjabell	Well, I'm taking databases as my restricted elective, so I was going to take one of those two as an 'other elective'
2018-03-13 09:22:26		Plus I kinda figure I shoudlnt overload too much on csc since I want to take senior design 
2018-03-13 09:26:04	jesse	Ms. Marini told me to take other restricted electives that were not computer science cuz she thought I was gonna overwork myself with senior design. 
2018-03-13 09:26:29	jesse	she also wants me to either take a class over the summer or not work... :disappointed: 
2018-03-13 09:26:49	gjabell	Lol why 
2018-03-13 09:28:07	gjabell	All the other electives suxk tho 
2018-03-13 09:28:28	jesse	I'm gonna be taking Human Computer Interaction and soft security 
2018-03-13 09:31:07	jesse	and senior design and I've got 2 other psy classes... I was gonna have cryptography in place of one of those psychology classes but marini said computer science is hard and it would be too much, so I should take Ergonomics instead lol.
2018-03-13 09:31:07		she also  said that senior design was gonna be a big time suck and that there would be plenty of times that I would have to meet up with either my team or the teachers outside of class or whatever. 
2018-03-13 09:31:48	jesse	I kinda agree with her. dunno if I will take a summer class or if I will drop working though 
2018-03-13 09:33:22	gjabell	Wait were you thinking of working next semester? Or does she wajt you to drop your internship? 
2018-03-13 09:37:27	jesse	haha not my internship. I've been doing research this semester for $$$ but she wants me to either drop it for the next semester or to drop a class next semester and keep it... Right now, I'm not quite sure what the financially correct option is. 
2018-03-13 09:37:47	gjabell	Oh OK lol 
2018-03-13 09:38:40	jesse	lol if marini told me to drop my internship I would probably scoff and use her computer to lift my advisement hold and leave. 
2018-03-13 09:39:17	gjabell	Lol yeah 
2018-03-16 13:53:02	gjabell	so I was bored and started writing a cli interface for slack using go 
2018-03-16 13:53:22	gjabell	but then I found out someone made a plugin for weechat, which is way more featured than anything I'd end up making 
2018-03-16 13:55:27	gjabell	so now I can move even more of my life to the command line :D 
2018-03-16 13:56:09	jesse	it's the same truth about programming.... everything has already been made haha.  
2018-03-16 13:56:09		so what is weechat? 
2018-03-16 13:56:43	gjabell	yeah xD 
2018-03-16 13:56:46	gjabell	it's an IRC client 
2018-03-16 13:56:53	gjabell	with lots of plugin options 
2018-03-16 13:57:04	jesse	awesome. I miss IRC. 
2018-03-16 13:57:15	gjabell	slack has an IRC gateway but they are decommisioning it 
2018-03-16 13:57:25	gjabell	but this plugin just uses their api so it still works 
2018-03-16 13:57:48	gjabell	https://github.com/wee-slack/wee-slack
2018-03-16 13:57:48		wee-slack/wee-slack

2018-03-16 13:58:47	gjabell	@gjabell uploaded a file: https://sturgill-operators.slack.com/files/U5AUU7HHA/F9R7M593M/2018-03-16-135733_2544x1427_scrot.png (2018-03-16-135733 2544x1427 scrot) 
2018-03-16 13:59:04	gjabell	I think I'm in love 
2018-03-16 13:59:20	jesse	also, what are you gonna do when everything you do is in a terminal? give up i3? 
2018-03-16 13:59:32	gjabell	xD I guess so yeah 
2018-03-16 13:59:40	jesse	omg that is soo coool 
2018-03-16 13:59:43	gjabell	i3 is basically tmux for a ui,so I guess I'll just move to tmux lol 
2018-03-16 13:59:51	gjabell	although web browsing in w3m kinda sucks so idk 
2018-03-16 13:59:55	gjabell	ikr 
2018-03-16 14:00:03	gjabell	it's super easy to setup too 
2018-03-16 14:00:40	jesse	i was gonna play a video game, but you gave my life meaning once more. 
2018-03-16 14:02:56	gjabell	:) 
2018-03-16 14:04:41	gjabell	ofc now I have to go spend a whole weekend exploring all the configuration xD 
2018-03-16 14:09:29	jesse	w3m isnt all that bad if we never needed wolfware or mypack 
2018-03-16 14:09:49	gjabell	that's fair I guess 
2018-03-16 14:09:56	gjabell	navigating is a bit of a pain tho 
2018-03-16 14:10:02	gjabell	at least until you get used to it I imagine 
2018-03-16 14:24:21	jesse	i'm trying to figure out how to message you lol 
2018-03-16 14:25:55	gjabell	worked on my side xD 
2018-03-16 14:26:08	gjabell	did you message me through weechat or the interface 
2018-03-16 14:26:27	jesse	yeah its a bit of a pain right now... I closed out and it looks like i need to go through the registration again. 
2018-03-16 14:26:32	jesse	UI 
2018-03-16 14:26:49	gjabell	oh 
2018-03-16 14:27:07	gjabell	after you register I think you need to do '/save' 
2018-03-16 14:27:16	gjabell	and it'll write it out to the conf file 
2018-03-16 14:27:41	gjabell	also I'd suggest using the secure method they mention if you're going to be committing it to any repos 
2018-03-16 14:27:49	jesse	the config file isn't loading either so I have to manually do that... 
2018-03-16 14:27:54	gjabell	hmm 
2018-03-16 14:27:58	gjabell	how did you configure it? 
2018-03-16 14:28:11	jesse	i just followed the installation instructions 
2018-03-16 14:28:24	gjabell	so wait if you open weechat does it load everything correctly? 
2018-03-16 14:28:38	gjabell	bc originally it wasn't loading the python script for me bc I used python3 instead of 2 
2018-03-16 14:28:42	gjabell	for the websocket-client 
2018-03-16 14:28:50	jesse	that might be it. 
2018-03-16 14:28:56	jesse	it isn't loading 
2018-03-16 14:29:21	gjabell	try installing python2-pip and using pip2 install to get the websocket-client 
2018-03-16 14:29:26	gjabell	that's what worked for me 
2018-03-16 14:30:25	jesse	yeah I have that...why cant people just decide which version of python people should universally use? :disappointed: 
2018-03-16 14:30:42	jesse	or make it back compatible. 
2018-03-16 14:31:06	gjabell	ikr 
2018-03-16 14:31:53	jesse	ok i got it back, but idk how to change the channel to gjabell 
2018-03-16 14:32:17	gjabell	try /buffer [whatever number shows up for me in the sidebar] 
2018-03-16 14:32:42	jesse	:) 
2018-03-16 14:32:45	jesse	:( 
2018-03-16 14:32:49	gjabell	rip xD 
2018-03-16 14:32:50	jesse	testing 
2018-03-16 14:32:54	jesse	yeayy 
2018-03-16 14:32:56	gjabell	woop 
2018-03-16 14:33:17	gjabell	you can switch things in the sidebar with ALT+number, or ALT+arrow keys 
2018-03-16 14:33:23	gjabell	or /buffer number 
2018-03-16 14:33:37	jesse	now we gotta get this running on my raspberry pi so I can ssh into it using my phone... 
2018-03-16 14:33:37	gjabell	or there's a script that let's you matched based on names 
2018-03-16 14:33:41	gjabell	lol xD 
2018-03-16 14:33:45	gjabell	shouldn't be too hard 
2018-03-16 14:34:33	jesse	I'm gonna work on loading my other channels in here. I wonder how this application is memory-wise... cuz the gui takes up loads of memory 
2018-03-16 14:34:47	gjabell	it's probably super minimal 
2018-03-16 14:35:08	gjabell	223M according to htop 
2018-03-16 14:35:31	gjabell	I don't even have the gui installed anymore so I can't check lol 
2018-03-16 14:36:59	jesse	haha i'm removing it now too 
2018-03-16 14:37:50	gjabell	I've been using the web interface bc the app kinda blows on i3 
2018-03-16 14:37:53	gjabell	but fuck that now xD 
2018-03-16 14:40:42	jesse	it is a lil hard to manage multiple channels though 
2018-03-16 14:41:01	gjabell	idk I don't think it's too bad 
2018-03-16 14:41:14	gjabell	you just have to remember which channel comes from which server 
2018-03-16 14:41:21	gjabell	or are you talking about something else 
2018-03-16 14:42:05	jesse	I added the 3 channels I was apart of. my sidebar is pretty cluttered and I'm not sure which people correspond to which channel... since there are duplicates

2018-03-16 14:49:54	jesse	haha nice 
2018-03-16 15:00:51	jesse	autoloading is still not working but I think ive remembered the command I need to run. 
2018-03-16 15:01:20	gjabell	did you put the script in the autoload folder 
2018-03-16 15:01:26	jesse	yup 
2018-03-16 15:01:44	gjabell	hmm 
2018-03-16 15:01:49	gjabell	that's weird, it worked fine for me 
2018-03-16 15:07:55		getting channel history...
2018-01-10 16:00:58	jesse	yo 
2018-01-10 16:01:03	gjabell	heyo 
2018-01-10 16:01:10	gjabell	this is going to make my life so much easier xD 
2018-01-10 16:02:29	jesse	I'm glad!! but you graduate some time soonish right? 
2018-01-10 16:02:40	gjabell	probably may 2019 
2018-01-10 16:02:43	gjabell	so a little while 
2018-01-10 16:02:51	jesse	oh ok. December for me 
2018-01-10 16:03:17	gjabell	ah, nice 
2018-01-10 16:04:14	jesse	yeah i don't really know about that ddns stuff. it's fancy talk but I think I understand what it does. 
2018-01-10 16:04:14		i stopped my server until i know what i want to do with it. 
2018-01-10 16:04:33	gjabell	ah 
2018-01-10 16:04:40	gjabell	you know what DNS is, right? 
2018-01-10 16:04:47	gjabell	domain names to IPs 
2018-01-10 16:04:52	jesse	yup 
2018-01-10 16:04:57	gjabell	ddns is dynamic dns 
2018-01-10 16:05:04	jesse	ahh! 
2018-01-10 16:05:06	gjabell	basically, a DNS record only works if you know the ip address of something 
2018-01-10 16:05:18	gjabell	and if you don't have a static IP, the domain will break as soon as your public IP changes 
2018-01-10 16:05:35	gjabell	ddns is basically a service where you can periodically update your DNS to point at your IP 
2018-01-10 16:05:44	gjabell	so even if your IP changes, it will update the DNS server 
2018-01-10 16:05:54	jesse	so why pay for a static ip if you could use ddns? 
2018-01-10 16:06:07	gjabell	really there's no reason xD 
2018-01-10 16:06:14	gjabell	I guess if you were running a DNS server :P 
2018-01-10 16:06:23	gjabell	cause as it turns out 
2018-01-10 16:06:32	gjabell	kinda hard to use DNS if you can't get it from the server xD 
2018-01-10 16:06:37	jesse	lets run a DNS server through DDNS 
2018-01-10 16:06:42	gjabell	lol 
2018-01-10 16:07:03	gjabell	I don't know that many places make you pay for a static ip anymore, not sure tho 
2018-01-10 16:07:07	gjabell	probably depends on the company 
2018-01-10 16:09:17	jesse	why are static ip addresses expensive? 
2018-01-10 16:09:27	gjabell	tbh not really sure 
2018-01-10 16:09:36	gjabell	I guess it probably requires more effort from the company 
2018-01-10 16:09:48	gjabell	dhcp is easy because you can just let a computer handle it 
2018-01-10 16:10:03	gjabell	static ips you need to make sure you don't hand out an ip that's in use 
2018-01-10 16:10:07	jesse	if you use ddns, youre basically taking away multiple possible ips rather than just one.... 
2018-01-10 16:10:31	gjabell	why? 
2018-01-10 16:13:53	jesse	well im kinda thinking about it like a pool of marbles. each one representing an ip address. if people took 1 out and only needed that 1... it would be simple and cheap to distribute... if we had a system of replacing a marble every hour or so, imagine how complex it would be to maintain which ips are used and which arent....  but i know computers are good at that stuff so it doesnt really matter..  
2018-01-10 16:20:29	jesse	point being, i think it would be cheaper to use ip addresses but it isnt. 
2018-01-10 16:25:59	gjabell	I don't think it's actually too difficult, basically there's a computer that keeps track of all assigned ips, and each ip address has a lease time (typically 24 hours or something), once the lease runs out the computer that was assigned the ip requests a new ip, and the computer hands it a new one (or typically the same one it had before unless that's now being used by something else)

2018-02-06 12:46:09	jesse	Hey Galen, have you had to screen-record on linux before? 
2018-02-06 13:24:26	gjabell	I did for the guided project in software engineering 
2018-02-06 13:24:40	gjabell	I think I used obs iirc 
2018-02-06 13:26:31	jesse	haven't tried that one. but all i can get is a black screen with a cursor as output :(
2018-02-06 13:26:31		I'm gonna try getting on a computer at the library and see if my PowerPoint can be opened with sound on there 
2018-02-06 13:26:51	gjabell	weird 
2018-02-06 13:26:55	gjabell	what program are you using 
2018-02-06 13:27:35	jesse	i used screencast, ffmpeg, simplescreenrecorder, and one other one. 
2018-02-06 13:28:31	gjabell	Hmm 
2018-02-06 13:30:44	jesse	why can't teachers just use libreoffice :'( 
2018-02-06 13:30:48	jesse	lol 
2018-02-06 13:31:08	gjabell	Ikr 
2018-03-01 13:27:05	jesse	are you studying any more than what we did on tuesday? 
2018-03-01 14:01:53	gjabell	I went over review 6 again bc that was the one I had the most trouble with 
2018-03-01 14:01:59	gjabell	didn't do much other than that tho 
2018-03-01 14:04:24	jesse	gotcha. I'm probably not gonna touch the material. 
2018-03-01 14:04:42	gjabell	yeah at this point I think I'm just going to let the chips fall where they do 
2018-03-12 18:34:19	gjabell	are you in the data-driven decision making special topics? 
2018-03-12 18:42:29	jesse	i was last semester 
2018-03-12 18:42:39	gjabell	was it fun 
2018-03-12 18:42:41	jesse	good easy A that got me a job that I am currently working. 
2018-03-12 18:42:52	jesse	all python 
2018-03-12 18:42:52	gjabell	seems good then, I might take it next semester 
2018-03-12 18:43:05	gjabell	do you know if there's reason to take soft. sec. if I'm taking comp. sec. atm 
2018-03-12 19:09:22	jesse	its easier and dr. king 
2018-03-13 07:33:09	gjabell	Fair XD
2018-03-13 07:33:09		Atm it's either that or decision making 
2018-03-13 09:19:16	jesse	take them both. surely theres another csc course you could get rid of? 
2018-03-13 09:22:26	gjabell	Well, I'm taking databases as my restricted elective, so I was going to take one of those two as an 'other elective'
2018-03-13 09:22:26		Plus I kinda figure I shoudlnt overload too much on csc since I want to take senior design 
2018-03-13 09:26:04	jesse	Ms. Marini told me to take other restricted electives that were not computer science cuz she thought I was gonna overwork myself with senior design. 
2018-03-13 09:26:29	jesse	she also wants me to either take a class over the summer or not work... :disappointed: 
2018-03-13 09:26:49	gjabell	Lol why 
2018-03-13 09:28:07	gjabell	All the other electives suxk tho 
2018-03-13 09:28:28	jesse	I'm gonna be taking Human Computer Interaction and soft security 
2018-03-13 09:31:07	jesse	and senior design and I've got 2 other psy classes... I was gonna have cryptography in place of one of those psychology classes but marini said computer science is hard and it would be too much, so I should take Ergonomics instead lol.
2018-03-13 09:31:07		she also  said that senior design was gonna be a big time suck and that there would be plenty of times that I would have to meet up with either my team or the teachers outside of class or whatever. 
2018-03-13 09:31:48	jesse	I kinda agree with her. dunno if I will take a summer class or if I will drop working though 
2018-03-13 09:33:22	gjabell	Wait were you thinking of working next semester? Or does she wajt you to drop your internship? 
2018-03-13 09:37:27	jesse	haha not my internship. I've been doing research this semester for $$$ but she wants me to either drop it for the next semester or to drop a class next semester and keep it... Right now, I'm not quite sure what the financially correct option is. 
2018-03-13 09:37:47	gjabell	Oh OK lol 
2018-03-13 09:38:40	jesse	lol if marini told me to drop my internship I would probably scoff and use her computer to lift my advisement hold and leave. 
2018-03-13 09:39:17	gjabell	Lol yeah 
2018-03-16 13:53:02	gjabell	so I was bored and started writing a cli interface for slack using go 
2018-03-16 13:53:22	gjabell	but then I found out someone made a plugin for weechat, which is way more featured than anything I'd end up making 
2018-03-16 13:55:27	gjabell	so now I can move even more of my life to the command line :D 
2018-03-16 13:56:09	jesse	it's the same truth about programming.... everything has already been made haha.  
2018-03-16 13:56:09		so what is weechat? 
2018-03-16 13:56:43	gjabell	yeah xD 
2018-03-16 13:56:46	gjabell	it's an IRC client 
2018-03-16 13:56:53	gjabell	with lots of plugin options 
2018-03-16 13:57:04	jesse	awesome. I miss IRC. 
2018-03-16 13:57:15	gjabell	slack has an IRC gateway but they are decommisioning it 
2018-03-16 13:57:25	gjabell	but this plugin just uses their api so it still works 
2018-03-16 13:57:48	gjabell	https://github.com/wee-slack/wee-slack

2018-03-16 13:59:04	gjabell	I think I'm in love 
2018-03-16 13:59:20	jesse	also, what are you gonna do when everything you do is in a terminal? give up i3? 
2018-03-16 13:59:32	gjabell	xD I guess so yeah 
2018-03-16 13:59:40	jesse	omg that is soo coool 
2018-03-16 13:59:43	gjabell	i3 is basically tmux for a ui,so I guess I'll just move to tmux lol 
2018-03-16 13:59:51	gjabell	although web browsing in w3m kinda sucks so idk 
2018-03-16 13:59:55	gjabell	ikr 
2018-03-16 14:00:03	gjabell	it's super easy to setup too 
2018-03-16 14:00:40	jesse	i was gonna play a video game, but you gave my life meaning once more. 
2018-03-16 14:02:56	gjabell	:) 
2018-03-16 14:04:41	gjabell	ofc now I have to go spend a whole weekend exploring all the configuration xD 
2018-03-16 14:09:29	jesse	w3m isnt all that bad if we never needed wolfware or mypack 
2018-03-16 14:09:49	gjabell	that's fair I guess 
2018-03-16 14:09:56	gjabell	navigating is a bit of a pain tho 
2018-03-16 14:10:02	gjabell	at least until you get used to it I imagine 
2018-03-16 14:24:21	jesse	i'm trying to figure out how to message you lol 
2018-03-16 14:25:55	gjabell	worked on my side xD 
2018-03-16 14:26:08	gjabell	did you message me through weechat or the interface 
2018-03-16 14:26:27	jesse	yeah its a bit of a pain right now... I closed out and it looks like i need to go through the registration again. 
2018-03-16 14:26:32	jesse	UI 
2018-03-16 14:26:49	gjabell	oh 
2018-03-16 14:27:07	gjabell	after you register I think you need to do '/save' 
2018-03-16 14:27:16	gjabell	and it'll write it out to the conf file 
2018-03-16 14:27:41	gjabell	also I'd suggest using the secure method they mention if you're going to be committing it to any repos 
2018-03-16 14:27:49	jesse	the config file isn't loading either so I have to manually do that... 
2018-03-16 14:27:54	gjabell	hmm 
2018-03-16 14:27:58	gjabell	how did you configure it? 
2018-03-16 14:28:11	jesse	i just followed the installation instructions 
2018-03-16 14:28:24	gjabell	so wait if you open weechat does it load everything correctly? 
2018-03-16 14:28:38	gjabell	bc originally it wasn't loading the python script for me bc I used python3 instead of 2 
2018-03-16 14:28:42	gjabell	for the websocket-client 
2018-03-16 14:28:50	jesse	that might be it. 
2018-03-16 14:28:56	jesse	it isn't loading 
2018-03-16 14:29:21	gjabell	try installing python2-pip and using pip2 install to get the websocket-client 
2018-03-16 14:29:26	gjabell	that's what worked for me 
2018-03-16 14:30:25	jesse	yeah I have that...why cant people just decide which version of python people should universally use? :disappointed: 
2018-03-16 14:30:42	jesse	or make it back compatible. 
2018-03-16 14:31:06	gjabell	ikr 
2018-03-16 14:31:53	jesse	ok i got it back, but idk how to change the channel to gjabell 
2018-03-16 14:32:17	gjabell	try /buffer [whatever number shows up for me in the sidebar] 
2018-03-16 14:32:42	jesse	:) 
2018-03-16 14:32:45	jesse	:( 
2018-03-16 14:32:49	gjabell	rip xD 
2018-03-16 14:32:50	jesse	testing 
2018-03-16 14:32:54	jesse	yeayy 
2018-03-16 14:32:56	gjabell	woop 
2018-03-16 14:33:17	gjabell	you can switch things in the sidebar with ALT+number, or ALT+arrow keys 
2018-03-16 14:33:23	gjabell	or /buffer number 
2018-03-16 14:33:37	jesse	now we gotta get this running on my raspberry pi so I can ssh into it using my phone... 
2018-03-16 14:33:37	gjabell	or there's a script that let's you matched based on names 
2018-03-16 14:33:41	gjabell	lol xD 
2018-03-16 14:33:45	gjabell	shouldn't be too hard 
2018-03-16 14:34:33	jesse	I'm gonna work on loading my other channels in here. I wonder how this application is memory-wise... cuz the gui takes up loads of memory 
2018-03-16 14:34:47	gjabell	it's probably super minimal 
2018-03-16 14:35:08	gjabell	223M according to htop 
2018-03-16 14:35:31	gjabell	I don't even have the gui installed anymore so I can't check lol 
2018-03-16 14:36:59	jesse	haha i'm removing it now too 
2018-03-16 14:37:50	gjabell	I've been using the web interface bc the app kinda blows on i3 
2018-03-16 14:37:53	gjabell	but fuck that now xD 
2018-03-16 14:40:42	jesse	it is a lil hard to manage multiple channels though 
2018-03-16 14:41:01	gjabell	idk I don't think it's too bad 
2018-03-16 14:41:14	gjabell	you just have to remember which channel comes from which server 
2018-03-16 14:41:21	gjabell	or are you talking about something else 
2018-03-16 14:42:05	jesse	I added the 3 channels I was apart of. my sidebar is pretty cluttered and I'm not sure which people correspond to which channel... since there are duplicates 
2018-03-16 14:42:13	gjabell	ah 
2018-03-16 14:42:22	gjabell	if you open a channel you can type /close and it'll go away from teh sidebar 
2018-03-16 14:42:38	gjabell	there also might be a way to tag things based on the server 
2018-03-16 14:43:52	gjabell	now I just have to get facebook messenger working on this and i'll never need a web-based chat again xD 
2018-03-16 14:49:54	jesse	haha nice 
2018-03-16 15:00:51	jesse	autoloading is still not working but I think ive remembered the command I need to run. 
2018-03-16 15:01:20	gjabell	did you put the script in the autoload folder 
2018-03-16 15:01:26	jesse	yup 
2018-03-16 15:01:44	gjabell	hmm 
2018-03-16 15:01:49	gjabell	that's weird, it worked fine for me 
2018-03-16 15:10:07	jesse	@jesse uploaded a file: https://sturgill-operators.slack.com/files/U3VPX29FW/F9S7E8DEJ/cool.png (cool) 
2018-03-16 15:13:19		getting channel history...
2018-01-10 16:00:58	jesse	yo 
2018-01-10 16:01:03	gjabell	heyo 
2018-01-10 16:01:10	gjabell	this is going to make my life so much easier xD 
2018-01-10 16:02:29	jesse	I'm glad!! but you graduate some time soonish right? 
2018-01-10 16:02:40	gjabell	probably may 2019 
2018-01-10 16:02:43	gjabell	so a little while 
2018-01-10 16:02:51	jesse	oh ok. December for me 
2018-01-10 16:03:17	gjabell	ah, nice 
2018-01-10 16:04:14	jesse	yeah i don't really know about that ddns stuff. it's fancy talk but I think I understand what it does. 
2018-01-10 16:04:14		i stopped my server until i know what i want to do with it. 
2018-01-10 16:04:33	gjabell	ah 
2018-01-10 16:04:40	gjabell	you know what DNS is, right? 
2018-01-10 16:04:47	gjabell	domain names to IPs 
2018-01-10 16:04:52	jesse	yup 
2018-01-10 16:04:57	gjabell	ddns is dynamic dns 
2018-01-10 16:05:04	jesse	ahh! 
2018-01-10 16:05:06	gjabell	basically, a DNS record only works if you know the ip address of something

2018-01-10 16:06:07	gjabell	really there's no reason xD 
2018-01-10 16:06:14	gjabell	I guess if you were running a DNS server :P 
2018-01-10 16:06:23	gjabell	cause as it turns out 
2018-01-10 16:06:32	gjabell	kinda hard to use DNS if you can't get it from the server xD 
2018-01-10 16:06:37	jesse	lets run a DNS server through DDNS 
2018-01-10 16:06:42	gjabell	lol 
2018-01-10 16:07:03	gjabell	I don't know that many places make you pay for a static ip anymore, not sure tho

2018-01-10 16:10:31	gjabell	why? 
2018-01-10 16:13:53	jesse	well im kinda thinking about it like a pool of marbles. each one representing an ip address. if people took 1 out and only needed that 1... it would be simple and cheap to distribute... if we had a system of replacing a marble every hour or so, imagine how complex it would be to maintain which ips are used and which arent....  but i know computers are good at that stuff so it doesnt really matter..  
2018-01-10 16:20:29	jesse	point being, i think it would be cheaper to use ip addresses but it isnt. 
2018-01-10 16:25:59	gjabell	I don't think it's actually too difficult, basically there's a computer that keeps track of all assigned ips, and each ip address has a lease time (typically 24 hours or something), once the lease runs out the computer that was assigned the ip requests a new ip, and the computer hands it a new one (or typically the same one it had before unless that's now being used by something else)

2018-02-06 12:46:09	jesse	Hey Galen, have you had to screen-record on linux before? 
2018-02-06 13:24:26	gjabell	I did for the guided project in software engineering 
2018-02-06 13:24:40	gjabell	I think I used obs iirc 
2018-02-06 13:26:31	jesse	haven't tried that one. but all i can get is a black screen with a cursor as output :(
2018-02-06 13:26:31		I'm gonna try getting on a computer at the library and see if my PowerPoint can be opened with sound on there 
2018-02-06 13:26:51	gjabell	weird 
2018-02-06 13:26:55	gjabell	what program are you using 
2018-02-06 13:27:35	jesse	i used screencast, ffmpeg, simplescreenrecorder, and one other one. 
2018-02-06 13:28:31	gjabell	Hmm 
2018-02-06 13:30:44	jesse	why can't teachers just use libreoffice :'( 
2018-02-06 13:30:48	jesse	lol 
2018-02-06 13:31:08	gjabell	Ikr 
2018-03-01 13:27:05	jesse	are you studying any more than what we did on tuesday? 
2018-03-01 14:01:53	gjabell	I went over review 6 again bc that was the one I had the most trouble with 
2018-03-01 14:01:59	gjabell	didn't do much other than that tho 
2018-03-01 14:04:24	jesse	gotcha. I'm probably not gonna touch the material. 
2018-03-01 14:04:42	gjabell	yeah at this point I think I'm just going to let the chips fall where they do 
2018-03-12 18:34:19	gjabell	are you in the data-driven decision making special topics? 
2018-03-12 18:42:29	jesse	i was last semester 
2018-03-12 18:42:39	gjabell	was it fun 
2018-03-12 18:42:41	jesse	good easy A that got me a job that I am currently working. 
2018-03-12 18:42:52	jesse	all python 
2018-03-12 18:42:52	gjabell	seems good then, I might take it next semester 
2018-03-12 18:43:05	gjabell	do you know if there's reason to take soft. sec. if I'm taking comp. sec. atm 
2018-03-12 19:09:22	jesse	its easier and dr. king 
2018-03-13 07:33:09	gjabell	Fair XD
2018-03-13 07:33:09		Atm it's either that or decision making 
2018-03-13 09:19:16	jesse	take them both. surely theres another csc course you could get rid of? 
2018-03-13 09:22:26	gjabell	Well, I'm taking databases as my restricted elective, so I was going to take one of those two as an 'other elective'
2018-03-13 09:22:26		Plus I kinda figure I shoudlnt overload too much on csc since I want to take senior design 
2018-03-13 09:26:04	jesse	Ms. Marini told me to take other restricted electives that were not computer science cuz she thought I was gonna overwork myself with senior design. 
2018-03-13 09:26:29	jesse	she also wants me to either take a class over the summer or not work... :disappointed: 
2018-03-13 09:26:49	gjabell	Lol why 
2018-03-13 09:28:07	gjabell	All the other electives suxk tho 
2018-03-13 09:28:28	jesse	I'm gonna be taking Human Computer Interaction and soft security 
2018-03-13 09:31:07	jesse	and senior design and I've got 2 other psy classes... I was gonna have cryptography in place of one of those psychology classes but marini said computer science is hard and it would be too much, so I should take Ergonomics instead lol.
2018-03-13 09:31:07		she also  said that senior design was gonna be a big time suck and that there would be plenty of times that I would have to meet up with either my team or the teachers outside of class or whatever. 
2018-03-13 09:31:48	jesse	I kinda agree with her. dunno if I will take a summer class or if I will drop working though 
2018-03-13 09:33:22	gjabell	Wait were you thinking of working next semester? Or does she wajt you to drop your internship? 
2018-03-13 09:37:27	jesse	haha not my internship. I've been doing research this semester for $$$ but she wants me to either drop it for the next semester or to drop a class next semester and keep it... Right now, I'm not quite sure what the financially correct option is. 
2018-03-13 09:37:47	gjabell	Oh OK lol 
2018-03-13 09:38:40	jesse	lol if marini told me to drop my internship I would probably scoff and use her computer to lift my advisement hold and leave. 
2018-03-13 09:39:17	gjabell	Lol yeah 
2018-03-16 13:53:02	gjabell	so I was bored and started writing a cli interface for slack using go 
2018-03-16 13:53:22	gjabell	but then I found out someone made a plugin for weechat, which is way more featured than anything I'd end up making 
2018-03-16 13:55:27	gjabell	so now I can move even more of my life to the command line :D 
2018-03-16 13:56:09	jesse	it's the same truth about programming.... everything has already been made haha.  
2018-03-16 13:56:09		so what is weechat? 
2018-03-16 13:56:43	gjabell	yeah xD 
2018-03-16 13:56:46	gjabell	it's an IRC client 
2018-03-16 13:56:53	gjabell	with lots of plugin options 
2018-03-16 13:57:04	jesse	awesome. I miss IRC. 
2018-03-16 13:57:15	gjabell	slack has an IRC gateway but they are decommisioning it 
2018-03-16 13:57:25	gjabell	but this plugin just uses their api so it still works 
2018-03-16 13:57:48	gjabell	https://github.com/wee-slack/wee-slack

2018-03-16 13:59:04	gjabell	I think I'm in love 
2018-03-16 13:59:20	jesse	also, what are you gonna do when everything you do is in a terminal? give up i3? 
2018-03-16 13:59:32	gjabell	xD I guess so yeah 
2018-03-16 13:59:40	jesse	omg that is soo coool 
2018-03-16 13:59:43	gjabell	i3 is basically tmux for a ui,so I guess I'll just move to tmux lol 
2018-03-16 13:59:51	gjabell	although web browsing in w3m kinda sucks so idk 
2018-03-16 13:59:55	gjabell	ikr 
2018-03-16 14:00:03	gjabell	it's super easy to setup too 
2018-03-16 14:00:40	jesse	i was gonna play a video game, but you gave my life meaning once more. 
2018-03-16 14:02:56	gjabell	:) 
2018-03-16 14:04:41	gjabell	ofc now I have to go spend a whole weekend exploring all the configuration xD 
2018-03-16 14:09:29	jesse	w3m isnt all that bad if we never needed wolfware or mypack 
2018-03-16 14:09:49	gjabell	that's fair I guess 
2018-03-16 14:09:56	gjabell	navigating is a bit of a pain tho 
2018-03-16 14:10:02	gjabell	at least until you get used to it I imagine 
2018-03-16 14:24:21	jesse	i'm trying to figure out how to message you lol 
2018-03-16 14:25:55	gjabell	worked on my side xD 
2018-03-16 14:26:08	gjabell	did you message me through weechat or the interface 
2018-03-16 14:26:27	jesse	yeah its a bit of a pain right now... I closed out and it looks like i need to go through the registration again. 
2018-03-16 14:26:32	jesse	UI 
2018-03-16 14:26:49	gjabell	oh 
2018-03-16 14:27:07	gjabell	after you register I think you need to do '/save' 
2018-03-16 14:27:16	gjabell	and it'll write it out to the conf file 
2018-03-16 14:27:41	gjabell	also I'd suggest using the secure method they mention if you're going to be committing it to any repos 
2018-03-16 14:27:49	jesse	the config file isn't loading either so I have to manually do that... 
2018-03-16 14:27:54	gjabell	hmm 
2018-03-16 14:27:58	gjabell	how did you configure it? 
2018-03-16 14:28:11	jesse	i just followed the installation instructions 
2018-03-16 14:28:24	gjabell	so wait if you open weechat does it load everything correctly? 
2018-03-16 14:28:38	gjabell	bc originally it wasn't loading the python script for me bc I used python3 instead of 2 
2018-03-16 14:28:42	gjabell	for the websocket-client 
2018-03-16 14:28:50	jesse	that might be it. 
2018-03-16 14:28:56	jesse	it isn't loading 
2018-03-16 14:29:21	gjabell	try installing python2-pip and using pip2 install to get the websocket-client 
2018-03-16 14:29:26	gjabell	that's what worked for me 
2018-03-16 14:30:25	jesse	yeah I have that...why cant people just decide which version of python people should universally use? :disappointed: 
2018-03-16 14:30:42	jesse	or make it back compatible. 
2018-03-16 14:31:06	gjabell	ikr 
2018-03-16 14:31:53	jesse	ok i got it back, but idk how to change the channel to gjabell 
2018-03-16 14:32:17	gjabell	try /buffer [whatever number shows up for me in the sidebar] 
2018-03-16 14:32:42	jesse	:) 
2018-03-16 14:32:45	jesse	:( 
2018-03-16 14:32:49	gjabell	rip xD 
2018-03-16 14:32:50	jesse	testing 
2018-03-16 14:32:54	jesse	yeayy 
2018-03-16 14:32:56	gjabell	woop 
2018-03-16 14:33:17	gjabell	you can switch things in the sidebar with ALT+number, or ALT+arrow keys 
2018-03-16 14:33:23	gjabell	or /buffer number 
2018-03-16 14:33:37	jesse	now we gotta get this running on my raspberry pi so I can ssh into it using my phone... 
2018-03-16 14:33:37	gjabell	or there's a script that let's you matched based on names 
2018-03-16 14:33:41	gjabell	lol xD 
2018-03-16 14:33:45	gjabell	shouldn't be too hard 
2018-03-16 14:34:33	jesse	I'm gonna work on loading my other channels in here. I wonder how this application is memory-wise... cuz the gui takes up loads of memory 
2018-03-16 14:34:47	gjabell	it's probably super minimal 
2018-03-16 14:35:08	gjabell	223M according to htop 
2018-03-16 14:35:31	gjabell	I don't even have the gui installed anymore so I can't check lol 
2018-03-16 14:36:59	jesse	haha i'm removing it now too 
2018-03-16 14:37:50	gjabell	I've been using the web interface bc the app kinda blows on i3 
2018-03-16 14:37:53	gjabell	but fuck that now xD 
2018-03-16 14:40:42	jesse	it is a lil hard to manage multiple channels though 
2018-03-16 14:41:01	gjabell	idk I don't think it's too bad 
2018-03-16 14:41:14	gjabell	you just have to remember which channel comes from which server 
2018-03-16 14:41:21	gjabell	or are you talking about something else 
2018-03-16 14:42:05	jesse	I added the 3 channels I was apart of. my sidebar is pretty cluttered and I'm not sure which people correspond to which channel... since there are duplicates 
2018-03-16 14:42:13	gjabell	ah 
2018-03-16 14:42:22	gjabell	if you open a channel you can type /close and it'll go away from teh sidebar 
2018-03-16 14:42:38	gjabell	there also might be a way to tag things based on the server 
2018-03-16 14:43:52	gjabell	now I just have to get facebook messenger working on this and i'll never need a web-based chat again xD 
2018-03-16 14:49:54	jesse	haha nice 
2018-03-16 15:00:51	jesse	autoloading is still not working but I think ive remembered the command I need to run. 
2018-03-16 15:01:20	gjabell	did you put the script in the autoload folder 
2018-03-16 15:01:26	jesse	yup 
2018-03-16 15:01:44	gjabell	hmm 
2018-03-16 15:01:49	gjabell	that's weird, it worked fine for me 
2018-03-16 15:10:07	jesse	@jesse uploaded a file: https://sturgill-operators.slack.com/files/U3VPX29FW/F9S7E8DEJ/cool.png (cool) 
2018-03-16 15:12:10	gjabell	xD 
2018-03-16 15:12:13	gjabell	that's sweet 
2018-03-16 15:12:21	gjabell	looks like fallout pip-boy lol 
2018-03-16 15:13:44	jesse	xD I never played that game but i've seen others play it. 
2018-03-16 15:14:14	jesse	also I wanted to make you open up the website once more. 
2018-03-16 15:14:26	gjabell	lol xD 
2018-03-16 15:16:35		getting channel history...
2018-01-10 16:00:58	jesse	yo 
2018-01-10 16:01:03	gjabell	heyo 
2018-01-10 16:01:10	gjabell	this is going to make my life so much easier xD 
2018-01-10 16:02:29	jesse	I'm glad!! but you graduate some time soonish right? 
2018-01-10 16:02:40	gjabell	probably may 2019 
2018-01-10 16:02:43	gjabell	so a little while 
2018-01-10 16:02:51	jesse	oh ok. December for me 
2018-01-10 16:03:17	gjabell	ah, nice 
2018-01-10 16:04:14	jesse	yeah i don't really know about that ddns stuff. it's fancy talk but I think I understand what it does. 
2018-01-10 16:04:14		i stopped my server until i know what i want to do with it. 
2018-01-10 16:04:33	gjabell	ah 
2018-01-10 16:04:40	gjabell	you know what DNS is, right? 
2018-01-10 16:04:47	gjabell	domain names to IPs 
2018-01-10 16:04:52	jesse	yup 
2018-01-10 16:04:57	gjabell	ddns is dynamic dns 
2018-01-10 16:05:04	jesse	ahh! 
2018-01-10 16:05:06	gjabell	basically, a DNS record only works if you know the ip address of something 
2018-01-10 16:05:18	gjabell	and if you don't have a static IP, the domain will break as soon as your public IP changes 
2018-01-10 16:05:35	gjabell	ddns is basically a service where you can periodically update your DNS to point at your IP 
2018-01-10 16:05:44	gjabell	so even if your IP changes, it will update the DNS server 
2018-01-10 16:05:54	jesse	so why pay for a static ip if you could use ddns? 
2018-01-10 16:06:07	gjabell	really there's no reason xD 
2018-01-10 16:06:14	gjabell	I guess if you were running a DNS server :P 
2018-01-10 16:06:23	gjabell	cause as it turns out 
2018-01-10 16:06:32	gjabell	kinda hard to use DNS if you can't get it from the server xD 
2018-01-10 16:06:37	jesse	lets run a DNS server through DDNS 
2018-01-10 16:06:42	gjabell	lol 
2018-01-10 16:07:03	gjabell	I don't know that many places make you pay for a static ip anymore, not sure tho 
2018-01-10 16:07:07	gjabell	probably depends on the company 
2018-01-10 16:09:17	jesse	why are static ip addresses expensive? 
2018-01-10 16:09:27	gjabell	tbh not really sure 
2018-01-10 16:09:36	gjabell	I guess it probably requires more effort from the company 
2018-01-10 16:09:48	gjabell	dhcp is easy because you can just let a computer handle it 
2018-01-10 16:10:03	gjabell	static ips you need to make sure you don't hand out an ip that's in use 
2018-01-10 16:10:07	jesse	if you use ddns, youre basically taking away multiple possible ips rather than just one.... 
2018-01-10 16:10:31	gjabell	why? 
2018-01-10 16:13:53	jesse	well im kinda thinking about it like a pool of marbles. each one representing an ip address. if people took 1 out and only needed that 1... it would be simple and cheap to distribute... if we had a system of replacing a marble every hour or so, imagine how complex it would be to maintain which ips are used and which arent....  but i know computers are good at that stuff so it doesnt really matter..  
2018-01-10 16:20:29	jesse	point being, i think it would be cheaper to use ip addresses but it isnt. 
2018-01-10 16:25:59	gjabell	I don't think it's actually too difficult, basically there's a computer that keeps track of all assigned ips, and each ip address has a lease time (typically 24 hours or something), once the lease runs out the computer that was assigned the ip requests a new ip, and the computer hands it a new one (or typically the same one it had before unless that's now being used by something else)

2018-02-06 12:46:09	jesse	Hey Galen, have you had to screen-record on linux before? 
2018-02-06 13:24:26	gjabell	I did for the guided project in software engineering 
2018-02-06 13:24:40	gjabell	I think I used obs iirc 
2018-02-06 13:26:31	jesse	haven't tried that one. but all i can get is a black screen with a cursor as output :(
2018-02-06 13:26:31		I'm gonna try getting on a computer at the library and see if my PowerPoint can be opened with sound on there 
2018-02-06 13:26:51	gjabell	weird 
2018-02-06 13:26:55	gjabell	what program are you using 
2018-02-06 13:27:35	jesse	i used screencast, ffmpeg, simplescreenrecorder, and one other one. 
2018-02-06 13:28:31	gjabell	Hmm 
2018-02-06 13:30:44	jesse	why can't teachers just use libreoffice :'( 
2018-02-06 13:30:48	jesse	lol 
2018-02-06 13:31:08	gjabell	Ikr 
2018-03-01 13:27:05	jesse	are you studying any more than what we did on tuesday? 
2018-03-01 14:01:53	gjabell	I went over review 6 again bc that was the one I had the most trouble with 
2018-03-01 14:01:59	gjabell	didn't do much other than that tho 
2018-03-01 14:04:24	jesse	gotcha. I'm probably not gonna touch the material. 
2018-03-01 14:04:42	gjabell	yeah at this point I think I'm just going to let the chips fall where they do 
2018-03-12 18:34:19	gjabell	are you in the data-driven decision making special topics? 
2018-03-12 18:42:29	jesse	i was last semester 
2018-03-12 18:42:39	gjabell	was it fun 
2018-03-12 18:42:41	jesse	good easy A that got me a job that I am currently working. 
2018-03-12 18:42:52	jesse	all python 
2018-03-12 18:42:52	gjabell	seems good then, I might take it next semester 
2018-03-12 18:43:05	gjabell	do you know if there's reason to take soft. sec. if I'm taking comp. sec. atm 
2018-03-12 19:09:22	jesse	its easier and dr. king 
2018-03-13 07:33:09	gjabell	Fair XD
2018-03-13 07:33:09		Atm it's either that or decision making 
2018-03-13 09:19:16	jesse	take them both. surely theres another csc course you could get rid of? 
2018-03-13 09:22:26	gjabell	Well, I'm taking databases as my restricted elective, so I was going to take one of those two as an 'other elective'
2018-03-13 09:22:26		Plus I kinda figure I shoudlnt overload too much on csc since I want to take senior design 
2018-03-13 09:26:04	jesse	Ms. Marini told me to take other restricted electives that were not computer science cuz she thought I was gonna overwork myself with senior design. 
2018-03-13 09:26:29	jesse	she also wants me to either take a class over the summer or not work... :disappointed: 
2018-03-13 09:26:49	gjabell	Lol why 
2018-03-13 09:28:07	gjabell	All the other electives suxk tho 
2018-03-13 09:28:28	jesse	I'm gonna be taking Human Computer Interaction and soft security 
2018-03-13 09:31:07	jesse	and senior design and I've got 2 other psy classes... I was gonna have cryptography in place of one of those psychology classes but marini said computer science is hard and it would be too much, so I should take Ergonomics instead lol.
2018-03-13 09:31:07		she also  said that senior design was gonna be a big time suck and that there would be plenty of times that I would have to meet up with either my team or the teachers outside of class or whatever. 
2018-03-13 09:31:48	jesse	I kinda agree with her. dunno if I will take a summer class or if I will drop working though 
2018-03-13 09:33:22	gjabell	Wait were you thinking of working next semester? Or does she wajt you to drop your internship? 
2018-03-13 09:37:27	jesse	haha not my internship. I've been doing research this semester for $$$ but she wants me to either drop it for the next semester or to drop a class next semester and keep it... Right now, I'm not quite sure what the financially correct option is. 
2018-03-13 09:37:47	gjabell	Oh OK lol 
2018-03-13 09:38:40	jesse	lol if marini told me to drop my internship I would probably scoff and use her computer to lift my advisement hold and leave. 
2018-03-13 09:39:17	gjabell	Lol yeah 
2018-03-16 13:53:02	gjabell	so I was bored and started writing a cli interface for slack using go 
2018-03-16 13:53:22	gjabell	but then I found out someone made a plugin for weechat, which is way more featured than anything I'd end up making 
2018-03-16 13:55:27	gjabell	so now I can move even more of my life to the command line :D 
2018-03-16 13:56:09	jesse	it's the same truth about programming.... everything has already been made haha.  
2018-03-16 13:56:09		so what is weechat? 
2018-03-16 13:56:43	gjabell	yeah xD 
2018-03-16 13:56:46	gjabell	it's an IRC client 
2018-03-16 13:56:53	gjabell	with lots of plugin options 
2018-03-16 13:57:04	jesse	awesome. I miss IRC. 
2018-03-16 13:57:15	gjabell	slack has an IRC gateway but they are decommisioning it 
2018-03-16 13:57:25	gjabell	but this plugin just uses their api so it still works 
2018-03-16 13:57:48	gjabell	https://github.com/wee-slack/wee-slack

2018-03-16 13:58:47	gjabell	@gjabell uploaded a file: https://sturgill-operators.slack.com/files/U5AUU7HHA/F9R7M593M/2018-03-16-135733_2544x1427_scrot.png (2018-03-16-135733 2544x1427 scrot) 
2018-03-16 13:59:04	gjabell	I think I'm in love 
2018-03-16 13:59:20	jesse	also, what are you gonna do when everything you do is in a terminal? give up i3? 
2018-03-16 13:59:32	gjabell	xD I guess so yeah 
2018-03-16 13:59:40	jesse	omg that is soo coool 
2018-03-16 13:59:43	gjabell	i3 is basically tmux for a ui,so I guess I'll just move to tmux lol 
2018-03-16 13:59:51	gjabell	although web browsing in w3m kinda sucks so idk 
2018-03-16 13:59:55	gjabell	ikr 
2018-03-16 14:00:03	gjabell	it's super easy to setup too 
2018-03-16 14:00:40	jesse	i was gonna play a video game, but you gave my life meaning once more. 
2018-03-16 14:02:56	gjabell	:) 
2018-03-16 14:04:41	gjabell	ofc now I have to go spend a whole weekend exploring all the configuration xD 
2018-03-16 14:09:29	jesse	w3m isnt all that bad if we never needed wolfware or mypack 
2018-03-16 14:09:49	gjabell	that's fair I guess 
2018-03-16 14:09:56	gjabell	navigating is a bit of a pain tho 
2018-03-16 14:10:02	gjabell	at least until you get used to it I imagine 
2018-03-16 14:24:21	jesse	i'm trying to figure out how to message you lol 
2018-03-16 14:25:55	gjabell	worked on my side xD 
2018-03-16 14:26:08	gjabell	did you message me through weechat or the interface 
2018-03-16 14:26:27	jesse	yeah its a bit of a pain right now... I closed out and it looks like i need to go through the registration again. 
2018-03-16 14:26:32	jesse	UI 
2018-03-16 14:26:49	gjabell	oh 
2018-03-16 14:27:07	gjabell	after you register I think you need to do '/save' 
2018-03-16 14:27:16	gjabell	and it'll write it out to the conf file 
2018-03-16 14:27:41	gjabell	also I'd suggest using the secure method they mention if you're going to be committing it to any repos 
2018-03-16 14:27:49	jesse	the config file isn't loading either so I have to manually do that... 
2018-03-16 14:27:54	gjabell	hmm 
2018-03-16 14:27:58	gjabell	how did you configure it? 
2018-03-16 14:28:11	jesse	i just followed the installation instructions 
2018-03-16 14:28:24	gjabell	so wait if you open weechat does it load everything correctly? 
2018-03-16 14:28:38	gjabell	bc originally it wasn't loading the python script for me bc I used python3 instead of 2 
2018-03-16 14:28:42	gjabell	for the websocket-client 
2018-03-16 14:28:50	jesse	that might be it. 
2018-03-16 14:28:56	jesse	it isn't loading 
2018-03-16 14:29:21	gjabell	try installing python2-pip and using pip2 install to get the websocket-client 
2018-03-16 14:29:26	gjabell	that's what worked for me 
2018-03-16 14:30:25	jesse	yeah I have that...why cant people just decide which version of python people should universally use? :disappointed: 
2018-03-16 14:30:42	jesse	or make it back compatible. 
2018-03-16 14:31:06	gjabell	ikr 
2018-03-16 14:31:53	jesse	ok i got it back, but idk how to change the channel to gjabell 
2018-03-16 14:32:17	gjabell	try /buffer [whatever number shows up for me in the sidebar] 
2018-03-16 14:32:42	jesse	:) 
2018-03-16 14:32:45	jesse	:( 
2018-03-16 14:32:49	gjabell	rip xD 
2018-03-16 14:32:50	jesse	testing 
2018-03-16 14:32:54	jesse	yeayy 
2018-03-16 14:32:56	gjabell	woop 
2018-03-16 14:33:17	gjabell	you can switch things in the sidebar with ALT+number, or ALT+arrow keys 
2018-03-16 14:33:23	gjabell	or /buffer number 
2018-03-16 14:33:37	jesse	now we gotta get this running on my raspberry pi so I can ssh into it using my phone... 
2018-03-16 14:33:37	gjabell	or there's a script that let's you matched based on names 
2018-03-16 14:33:41	gjabell	lol xD 
2018-03-16 14:33:45	gjabell	shouldn't be too hard 
2018-03-16 14:34:33	jesse	I'm gonna work on loading my other channels in here. I wonder how this application is memory-wise... cuz the gui takes up loads of memory 
2018-03-16 14:34:47	gjabell	it's probably super minimal 
2018-03-16 14:35:08	gjabell	223M according to htop 
2018-03-16 14:35:31	gjabell	I don't even have the gui installed anymore so I can't check lol 
2018-03-16 14:36:59	jesse	haha i'm removing it now too 
2018-03-16 14:37:50	gjabell	I've been using the web interface bc the app kinda blows on i3 
2018-03-16 14:37:53	gjabell	but fuck that now xD 
2018-03-16 14:40:42	jesse	it is a lil hard to manage multiple channels though 
2018-03-16 14:41:01	gjabell	idk I don't think it's too bad 
2018-03-16 14:41:14	gjabell	you just have to remember which channel comes from which server 
2018-03-16 14:41:21	gjabell	or are you talking about something else 
2018-03-16 14:42:05	jesse	I added the 3 channels I was apart of. my sidebar is pretty cluttered and I'm not sure which people correspond to which channel... since there are duplicates 
2018-03-16 14:42:13	gjabell	ah 
2018-03-16 14:42:22	gjabell	if you open a channel you can type /close and it'll go away from teh sidebar 
2018-03-16 14:42:38	gjabell	there also might be a way to tag things based on the server 
2018-03-16 14:43:52	gjabell	now I just have to get facebook messenger working on this and i'll never need a web-based chat again xD 
2018-03-16 14:49:54	jesse	haha nice 
2018-03-16 15:00:51	jesse	autoloading is still not working but I think ive remembered the command I need to run. 
2018-03-16 15:01:20	gjabell	did you put the script in the autoload folder 
2018-03-16 15:01:26	jesse	yup 
2018-03-16 15:01:44	gjabell	hmm 
2018-03-16 15:01:49	gjabell	that's weird, it worked fine for me 
2018-03-16 15:10:07	jesse	@jesse uploaded a file: https://sturgill-operators.slack.com/files/U3VPX29FW/F9S7E8DEJ/cool.png (cool) 
2018-03-16 15:12:10	gjabell	xD 
2018-03-16 15:12:13	gjabell	that's sweet 
2018-03-16 15:12:21	gjabell	looks like fallout pip-boy lol 
2018-03-16 15:13:44	jesse	xD I never played that game but i've seen others play it. 
2018-03-16 15:14:14	jesse	also I wanted to make you open up the website once more. 
2018-03-16 15:14:26	gjabell	lol xD 
2018-03-16 15:14:38	gjabell	unf idk if thgere's a way to display images directly in weechat 
2018-03-16 15:14:53	jesse	w3m can do it. 
2018-03-16 15:15:14	gjabell	gotta be some way then xD 
2018-03-16 15:15:24	gjabell	probably a plugin out there, or you could write one yourself lol 
2018-03-16 15:16:03	jesse	mehhhhh. 
2018-03-16 15:16:13	jesse	i'm gonna play video games or go on a walk instead 
2018-03-16 15:16:20	gjabell	yeah seems like a better idea 
2018-03-16 15:16:26	gjabell	I should probably get outside too lol 
2018-03-16 15:23:34		getting channel history...
2018-01-10 16:00:58	jesse	yo 
2018-01-10 16:01:03	gjabell	heyo 
2018-01-10 16:01:10	gjabell	this is going to make my life so much easier xD 
2018-01-10 16:02:29	jesse	I'm glad!! but you graduate some time soonish right? 
2018-01-10 16:02:40	gjabell	probably may 2019 
2018-01-10 16:02:43	gjabell	so a little while 
2018-01-10 16:02:51	jesse	oh ok. December for me 
2018-01-10 16:03:17	gjabell	ah, nice 
2018-01-10 16:04:14	jesse	yeah i don't really know about that ddns stuff. it's fancy talk but I think I understand what it does. 
2018-01-10 16:04:14		i stopped my server until i know what i want to do with it. 
2018-01-10 16:04:33	gjabell	ah 
2018-01-10 16:04:40	gjabell	you know what DNS is, right? 
2018-01-10 16:04:47	gjabell	domain names to IPs 
2018-01-10 16:04:52	jesse	yup 
2018-01-10 16:04:57	gjabell	ddns is dynamic dns 
2018-01-10 16:05:04	jesse	ahh! 
2018-01-10 16:05:06	gjabell	basically, a DNS record only works if you know the ip address of something 
2018-01-10 16:05:18	gjabell	and if you don't have a static IP, the domain will break as soon as your public IP changes 
2018-01-10 16:05:35	gjabell	ddns is basically a service where you can periodically update your DNS to point at your IP 
2018-01-10 16:05:44	gjabell	so even if your IP changes, it will update the DNS server 
2018-01-10 16:05:54	jesse	so why pay for a static ip if you could use ddns? 
2018-01-10 16:06:07	gjabell	really there's no reason xD 
2018-01-10 16:06:14	gjabell	I guess if you were running a DNS server :P 
2018-01-10 16:06:23	gjabell	cause as it turns out 
2018-01-10 16:06:32	gjabell	kinda hard to use DNS if you can't get it from the server xD 
2018-01-10 16:06:37	jesse	lets run a DNS server through DDNS 
2018-01-10 16:06:42	gjabell	lol 
2018-01-10 16:07:03	gjabell	I don't know that many places make you pay for a static ip anymore, not sure tho 
2018-01-10 16:07:07	gjabell	probably depends on the company 
2018-01-10 16:09:17	jesse	why are static ip addresses expensive? 
2018-01-10 16:09:27	gjabell	tbh not really sure 
2018-01-10 16:09:36	gjabell	I guess it probably requires more effort from the company 
2018-01-10 16:09:48	gjabell	dhcp is easy because you can just let a computer handle it 
2018-01-10 16:10:03	gjabell	static ips you need to make sure you don't hand out an ip that's in use 
2018-01-10 16:10:07	jesse	if you use ddns, youre basically taking away multiple possible ips rather than just one.... 
2018-01-10 16:10:31	gjabell	why? 
2018-01-10 16:13:53	jesse	well im kinda thinking about it like a pool of marbles. each one representing an ip address. if people took 1 out and only needed that 1... it would be simple and cheap to distribute... if we had a system of replacing a marble every hour or so, imagine how complex it would be to maintain which ips are used and which arent....  but i know computers are good at that stuff so it doesnt really matter..  
2018-01-10 16:20:29	jesse	point being, i think it would be cheaper to use ip addresses but it isnt. 
2018-01-10 16:25:59	gjabell	I don't think it's actually too difficult, basically there's a computer that keeps track of all assigned ips, and each ip address has a lease time (typically 24 hours or something), once the lease runs out the computer that was assigned the ip requests a new ip, and the computer hands it a new one (or typically the same one it had before unless that's now being used by something else)

2018-02-06 12:46:09	jesse	Hey Galen, have you had to screen-record on linux before? 
2018-02-06 13:24:26	gjabell	I did for the guided project in software engineering 
2018-02-06 13:24:40	gjabell	I think I used obs iirc 
2018-02-06 13:26:31	jesse	haven't tried that one. but all i can get is a black screen with a cursor as output :(
2018-02-06 13:26:31		I'm gonna try getting on a computer at the library and see if my PowerPoint can be opened with sound on there 
2018-02-06 13:26:51	gjabell	weird 
2018-02-06 13:26:55	gjabell	what program are you using 
2018-02-06 13:27:35	jesse	i used screencast, ffmpeg, simplescreenrecorder, and one other one. 
2018-02-06 13:28:31	gjabell	Hmm 
2018-02-06 13:30:44	jesse	why can't teachers just use libreoffice :'( 
2018-02-06 13:30:48	jesse	lol

2018-03-13 09:19:16	jesse	take them both. surely theres another csc course you could get rid of? 
2018-03-13 09:22:26	gjabell	Well, I'm taking databases as my restricted elective, so I was going to take one of those two as an 'other elective'
2018-03-13 09:22:26		Plus I kinda figure I shoudlnt overload too much on csc since I want to take senior design 
2018-03-13 09:26:04	jesse	Ms. Marini told me to take other restricted electives that were not computer science cuz she thought I was gonna overwork myself with senior design. 
2018-03-13 09:26:29	jesse	she also wants me to either take a class over the summer or not work... :disappointed: 
2018-03-13 09:26:49	gjabell	Lol why 
2018-03-13 09:28:07	gjabell	All the other electives suxk tho 
2018-03-13 09:28:28	jesse	I'm gonna be taking Human Computer Interaction and soft security 
2018-03-13 09:31:07	jesse	and senior design and I've got 2 other psy classes... I was gonna have cryptography in place of one of those psychology classes but marini said computer science is hard and it would be too much, so I should take Ergonomics instead lol.
2018-03-13 09:31:07		she also  said that senior design was gonna be a big time suck and that there would be plenty of times that I would have to meet up with either my team or the teachers outside of class or whatever. 
2018-03-13 09:31:48	jesse	I kinda agree with her. dunno if I will take a summer class or if I will drop working though 
2018-03-13 09:33:22	gjabell	Wait were you thinking of working next semester? Or does she wajt you to drop your internship? 
2018-03-13 09:37:27	jesse	haha not my internship. I've been doing research this semester for $$$ but she wants me to either drop it for the next semester or to drop a class next semester and keep it... Right now, I'm not quite sure what the financially correct option is. 
2018-03-13 09:37:47	gjabell	Oh OK lol 
2018-03-13 09:38:40	jesse	lol if marini told me to drop my internship I would probably scoff and use her computer to lift my advisement hold and leave. 
2018-03-13 09:39:17	gjabell	Lol yeah 
2018-03-16 13:53:02	gjabell	so I was bored and started writing a cli interface for slack using go 
2018-03-16 13:53:22	gjabell	but then I found out someone made a plugin for weechat, which is way more featured than anything I'd end up making 
2018-03-16 13:55:27	gjabell	so now I can move even more of my life to the command line :D 
2018-03-16 13:56:09	jesse	it's the same truth about programming.... everything has already been made haha.  
2018-03-16 13:56:09		so what is weechat? 
2018-03-16 13:56:43	gjabell	yeah xD 
2018-03-16 13:56:46	gjabell	it's an IRC client 
2018-03-16 13:56:53	gjabell	with lots of plugin options 
2018-03-16 13:57:04	jesse	awesome. I miss IRC. 
2018-03-16 13:57:15	gjabell	slack has an IRC gateway but they are decommisioning it 
2018-03-16 13:57:25	gjabell	but this plugin just uses their api so it still works

2018-03-16 13:59:04	gjabell	I think I'm in love 
2018-03-16 13:59:20	jesse	also, what are you gonna do when everything you do is in a terminal? give up i3? 
2018-03-16 13:59:32	gjabell	xD I guess so yeah 
2018-03-16 13:59:40	jesse	omg that is soo coool 
2018-03-16 13:59:43	gjabell	i3 is basically tmux for a ui,so I guess I'll just move to tmux lol 
2018-03-16 13:59:51	gjabell	although web browsing in w3m kinda sucks so idk 
2018-03-16 13:59:55	gjabell	ikr 
2018-03-16 14:00:03	gjabell	it's super easy to setup too 
2018-03-16 14:00:40	jesse	i was gonna play a video game, but you gave my life meaning once more. 
2018-03-16 14:02:56	gjabell	:) 
2018-03-16 14:04:41	gjabell	ofc now I have to go spend a whole weekend exploring all the configuration xD 
2018-03-16 14:09:29	jesse	w3m isnt all that bad if we never needed wolfware or mypack 
2018-03-16 14:09:49	gjabell	that's fair I guess 
2018-03-16 14:09:56	gjabell	navigating is a bit of a pain tho 
2018-03-16 14:10:02	gjabell	at least until you get used to it I imagine 
2018-03-16 14:24:21	jesse	i'm trying to figure out how to message you lol 
2018-03-16 14:25:55	gjabell	worked on my side xD 
2018-03-16 14:26:08	gjabell	did you message me through weechat or the interface 
2018-03-16 14:26:27	jesse	yeah its a bit of a pain right now... I closed out and it looks like i need to go through the registration again. 
2018-03-16 14:26:32	jesse	UI 
2018-03-16 14:26:49	gjabell	oh 
2018-03-16 14:27:07	gjabell	after you register I think you need to do '/save' 
2018-03-16 14:27:16	gjabell	and it'll write it out to the conf file 
2018-03-16 14:27:41	gjabell	also I'd suggest using the secure method they mention if you're going to be committing it to any repos 
2018-03-16 14:27:49	jesse	the config file isn't loading either so I have to manually do that... 
2018-03-16 14:27:54	gjabell	hmm 
2018-03-16 14:27:58	gjabell	how did you configure it? 
2018-03-16 14:28:11	jesse	i just followed the installation instructions 
2018-03-16 14:28:24	gjabell	so wait if you open weechat does it load everything correctly? 
2018-03-16 14:28:38	gjabell	bc originally it wasn't loading the python script for me bc I used python3 instead of 2 
2018-03-16 14:28:42	gjabell	for the websocket-client 
2018-03-16 14:28:50	jesse	that might be it. 
2018-03-16 14:28:56	jesse	it isn't loading 
2018-03-16 14:29:21	gjabell	try installing python2-pip and using pip2 install to get the websocket-client 
2018-03-16 14:29:26	gjabell	that's what worked for me 
2018-03-16 14:30:25	jesse	yeah I have that...why cant people just decide which version of python people should universally use? :disappointed: 
2018-03-16 14:30:42	jesse	or make it back compatible. 
2018-03-16 14:31:06	gjabell	ikr 
2018-03-16 14:31:53	jesse	ok i got it back, but idk how to change the channel to gjabell 
2018-03-16 14:32:17	gjabell	try /buffer [whatever number shows up for me in the sidebar] 
2018-03-16 14:32:42	jesse	:) 
2018-03-16 14:32:45	jesse	:( 
2018-03-16 14:32:49	gjabell	rip xD 
2018-03-16 14:32:50	jesse	testing 
2018-03-16 14:32:54	jesse	yeayy 
2018-03-16 14:32:56	gjabell	woop 
2018-03-16 14:33:17	gjabell	you can switch things in the sidebar with ALT+number, or ALT+arrow keys 
2018-03-16 14:33:23	gjabell	or /buffer number 
2018-03-16 14:33:37	jesse	now we gotta get this running on my raspberry pi so I can ssh into it using my phone... 
2018-03-16 14:33:37	gjabell	or there's a script that let's you matched based on names 
2018-03-16 14:33:41	gjabell	lol xD 
2018-03-16 14:33:45	gjabell	shouldn't be too hard 
2018-03-16 14:34:33	jesse	I'm gonna work on loading my other channels in here. I wonder how this application is memory-wise... cuz the gui takes up loads of memory 
2018-03-16 14:34:47	gjabell	it's probably super minimal 
2018-03-16 14:35:08	gjabell	223M according to htop 
2018-03-16 14:35:31	gjabell	I don't even have the gui installed anymore so I can't check lol 
2018-03-16 14:36:59	jesse	haha i'm removing it now too 
2018-03-16 14:37:50	gjabell	I've been using the web interface bc the app kinda blows on i3 
2018-03-16 14:37:53	gjabell	but fuck that now xD 
2018-03-16 14:40:42	jesse	it is a lil hard to manage multiple channels though 
2018-03-16 14:41:01	gjabell	idk I don't think it's too bad 
2018-03-16 14:41:14	gjabell	you just have to remember which channel comes from which server 
2018-03-16 14:41:21	gjabell	or are you talking about something else 
2018-03-16 14:42:05	jesse	I added the 3 channels I was apart of. my sidebar is pretty cluttered and I'm not sure which people correspond to which channel... since there are duplicates 
2018-03-16 14:42:13	gjabell	ah 
2018-03-16 14:42:22	gjabell	if you open a channel you can type /close and it'll go away from teh sidebar 
2018-03-16 14:42:38	gjabell	there also might be a way to tag things based on the server 
2018-03-16 14:43:52	gjabell	now I just have to get facebook messenger working on this and i'll never need a web-based chat again xD 
2018-03-16 14:49:54	jesse	haha nice 
2018-03-16 15:00:51	jesse	autoloading is still not working but I think ive remembered the command I need to run. 
2018-03-16 15:01:20	gjabell	did you put the script in the autoload folder 
2018-03-16 15:01:26	jesse	yup 
2018-03-16 15:01:44	gjabell	hmm 
2018-03-16 15:01:49	gjabell	that's weird, it worked fine for me 
2018-03-16 15:10:07	jesse	@jesse uploaded a file: https://sturgill-operators.slack.com/files/U3VPX29FW/F9S7E8DEJ/cool.png (cool) 
2018-03-16 15:12:10	gjabell	xD 
2018-03-16 15:12:13	gjabell	that's sweet 
2018-03-16 15:12:21	gjabell	looks like fallout pip-boy lol 
2018-03-16 15:13:44	jesse	xD I never played that game but i've seen others play it. 
2018-03-16 15:14:14	jesse	also I wanted to make you open up the website once more. 
2018-03-16 15:14:26	gjabell	lol xD 
2018-03-16 15:14:38	gjabell	unf idk if thgere's a way to display images directly in weechat 
2018-03-16 15:14:53	jesse	w3m can do it. 
2018-03-16 15:15:14	gjabell	gotta be some way then xD 
2018-03-16 15:15:24	gjabell	probably a plugin out there, or you could write one yourself lol 
2018-03-16 15:16:03	jesse	mehhhhh. 
2018-03-16 15:16:13	jesse	i'm gonna play video games or go on a walk instead 
2018-03-16 15:16:20	gjabell	yeah seems like a better idea 
2018-03-16 15:16:26	gjabell	I should probably get outside too lol 
2018-03-16 15:23:58	jesse	I figured out the autoconfig thing. turns out autoload was supposed to be a directory... not a filename 
2018-03-16 17:23:22		getting channel history...
2018-03-01 13:27:05	jesse	are you studying any more than what we did on tuesday? 
2018-03-01 14:01:53	gjabell	I went over review 6 again bc that was the one I had the most trouble with 
2018-03-01 14:01:59	gjabell	didn't do much other than that tho 
2018-03-01 14:04:24	jesse	gotcha. I'm probably not gonna touch the material. 
2018-03-01 14:04:42	gjabell	yeah at this point I think I'm just going to let the chips fall where they do 
2018-03-12 18:34:19	gjabell	are you in the data-driven decision making special topics? 
2018-03-12 18:42:29	jesse	i was last semester 
2018-03-12 18:42:39	gjabell	was it fun 
2018-03-12 18:42:41	jesse	good easy A that got me a job that I am currently working. 
2018-03-12 18:42:52	jesse	all python 
2018-03-12 18:42:52	gjabell	seems good then, I might take it next semester 
2018-03-12 18:43:05	gjabell	do you know if there's reason to take soft. sec. if I'm taking comp. sec. atm 
2018-03-12 19:09:22	jesse	its easier and dr. king 
2018-03-13 07:33:09	gjabell	Fair XD
2018-03-13 07:33:09		Atm it's either that or decision making

2018-03-13 09:31:07	jesse	and senior design and I've got 2 other psy classes... I was gonna have cryptography in place of one of those psychology classes but marini said computer science is hard and it would be too much, so I should take Ergonomics instead lol.

2018-03-16 13:53:02	gjabell	so I was bored and started writing a cli interface for slack using go 
2018-03-16 13:53:22	gjabell	but then I found out someone made a plugin for weechat, which is way more featured than anything I'd end up making

2018-03-16 14:28:42	gjabell	for the websocket-client 
2018-03-16 14:28:50	jesse	that might be it. 
2018-03-16 14:28:56	jesse	it isn't loading 
2018-03-16 14:29:21	gjabell	try installing python2-pip and using pip2 install to get the websocket-client 
2018-03-16 14:29:26	gjabell	that's what worked for me 
2018-03-16 14:30:25	jesse	yeah I have that...why cant people just decide which version of python people should universally use? :disappointed: 
2018-03-16 14:30:42	jesse	or make it back compatible. 
2018-03-16 14:31:06	gjabell	ikr 
2018-03-16 14:31:53	jesse	ok i got it back, but idk how to change the channel to gjabell 
2018-03-16 14:32:17	gjabell	try /buffer [whatever number shows up for me in the sidebar] 
2018-03-16 14:32:42	jesse	:) 
2018-03-16 14:32:45	jesse	:( 
2018-03-16 14:32:49	gjabell	rip xD 
2018-03-16 14:32:50	jesse	testing 
2018-03-16 14:32:54	jesse	yeayy 
2018-03-16 14:32:56	gjabell	woop 
2018-03-16 14:33:17	gjabell	you can switch things in the sidebar with ALT+number, or ALT+arrow keys 
2018-03-16 14:33:23	gjabell	or /buffer number 
2018-03-16 14:33:37	jesse	now we gotta get this running on my raspberry pi so I can ssh into it using my phone... 
2018-03-16 14:33:37	gjabell	or there's a script that let's you matched based on names 
2018-03-16 14:33:41	gjabell	lol xD 
2018-03-16 14:33:45	gjabell	shouldn't be too hard 
2018-03-16 14:34:33	jesse	I'm gonna work on loading my other channels in here. I wonder how this application is memory-wise... cuz the gui takes up loads of memory 
2018-03-16 14:34:47	gjabell	it's probably super minimal 
2018-03-16 14:35:08	gjabell	223M according to htop 
2018-03-16 14:35:31	gjabell	I don't even have the gui installed anymore so I can't check lol 
2018-03-16 14:36:59	jesse	haha i'm removing it now too 
2018-03-16 14:37:50	gjabell	I've been using the web interface bc the app kinda blows on i3 
2018-03-16 14:37:53	gjabell	but fuck that now xD 
2018-03-16 14:40:42	jesse	it is a lil hard to manage multiple channels though 
2018-03-16 14:41:01	gjabell	idk I don't think it's too bad 
2018-03-16 14:41:14	gjabell	you just have to remember which channel comes from which server 
2018-03-16 14:41:21	gjabell	or are you talking about something else 
2018-03-16 14:42:05	jesse	I added the 3 channels I was apart of. my sidebar is pretty cluttered and I'm not sure which people correspond to which channel... since there are duplicates 
2018-03-16 14:42:13	gjabell	ah 
2018-03-16 14:42:22	gjabell	if you open a channel you can type /close and it'll go away from teh sidebar 
2018-03-16 14:42:38	gjabell	there also might be a way to tag things based on the server 
2018-03-16 14:43:52	gjabell	now I just have to get facebook messenger working on this and i'll never need a web-based chat again xD 
2018-03-16 14:49:54	jesse	haha nice 
2018-03-16 15:00:51	jesse	autoloading is still not working but I think ive remembered the command I need to run. 
2018-03-16 15:01:20	gjabell	did you put the script in the autoload folder 
2018-03-16 15:01:26	jesse	yup 
2018-03-16 15:01:44	gjabell	hmm 
2018-03-16 15:01:49	gjabell	that's weird, it worked fine for me 
2018-03-16 15:10:07	jesse	@jesse uploaded a file: https://sturgill-operators.slack.com/files/U3VPX29FW/F9S7E8DEJ/cool.png (cool) 
2018-03-16 15:12:10	gjabell	xD 
2018-03-16 15:12:13	gjabell	that's sweet 
2018-03-16 15:12:21	gjabell	looks like fallout pip-boy lol 
2018-03-16 15:13:44	jesse	xD I never played that game but i've seen others play it. 
2018-03-16 15:14:14	jesse	also I wanted to make you open up the website once more. 
2018-03-16 15:14:26	gjabell	lol xD 
2018-03-16 15:14:38	gjabell	unf idk if thgere's a way to display images directly in weechat 
2018-03-16 15:14:53	jesse	w3m can do it. 
2018-03-16 15:15:14	gjabell	gotta be some way then xD 
2018-03-16 15:15:24	gjabell	probably a plugin out there, or you could write one yourself lol 
2018-03-16 15:16:03	jesse	mehhhhh. 
2018-03-16 15:16:13	jesse	i'm gonna play video games or go on a walk instead 
2018-03-16 15:16:20	gjabell	yeah seems like a better idea 
2018-03-16 15:16:26	gjabell	I should probably get outside too lol 
2018-03-16 15:23:58	jesse	I figured out the autoconfig thing. turns out autoload was supposed to be a directory... not a filename 
2018-03-16 15:24:06	gjabell	ah 
2018-03-16 15:24:07	gjabell	nice 
2018-03-16 16:40:43	jesse	hey hows computer security goin for ya? 
2018-03-16 16:41:37	gjabell	I've really been enjoying it 
2018-03-16 16:41:50	gjabell	makes me feel like a leet hax0r lol 
2018-03-16 16:42:18	gjabell	the teacher is a bit hard to follow sometimes bc he'll kinda just spew information from a slide, but it hasn't been too bad 
2018-03-16 16:42:25	gjabell	plus the projects are really cool 
2018-03-16 16:45:08	jesse	thats cool. i wanna hack stuff lol. i feel pretty bored at school cuz none of the problems are challenging... they're just super time consuming or memorization. :( 
2018-03-16 16:45:24	gjabell	yeah I feel that 
2018-03-16 16:45:36	gjabell	I've just been trying to do a bunch of side projects to keep me busy 
2018-03-16 16:45:48	gjabell	although it's hard to finish them lol cause I get demotivated xD 
2018-03-16 16:48:35	jesse	lol. i kinda treat my research like a side project... but I'm getting kinda depressed with the direction it's taking. 
2018-03-16 16:48:49	gjabell	ah, rip 
2018-03-16 16:48:52	gjabell	is it not going well? 
2018-03-16 16:52:52	jesse	its going alright. but we met with people who wanted to design our webpage last week... and what they came up with would make me never want to use the site even if I needed it.
2018-03-16 16:52:52		they wanted parallax scrolling, autosizing text, text flying in from different directions, and menus that drop down whenever the mouse is over it... they even mentioned popups... 
2018-03-16 16:53:08	gjabell	ugh 
2018-03-16 16:53:38	jesse	but from that experience, I learned that I wasnt meant to become a front end developer. 
2018-03-16 16:53:45	gjabell	lol xD 
2018-03-16 16:55:44	jesse	also, they wanted to replace the phrase "rare diseases" with something more positive.... like "unique diseases"..
2018-03-16 16:55:44		If my child was dying, I wouldnt want a website calling the dying child unique... 
2018-03-16 16:56:29	gjabell	lol that's really weird 
2018-03-16 16:56:49	jesse	i almost want to put in confetti animations haha. 
2018-03-16 16:57:19	gjabell	"congrats! your child has a unique disease!" confetti explodes from the sides 
2018-03-16 16:58:15	jesse	haha yeah!! scroll down to learn more about the history of this project before you can search for any real information. 
2018-03-16 16:58:27	gjabell	lol 
2018-03-16 16:59:10	jesse	...lets make the rest of the website invisible unless they watch a 30 minute video on "innovation". 
2018-03-16 16:59:32	gjabell	and that, ladies and gents, is how you ensure no one ever visits your site again 
2018-03-16 17:01:13	jesse	its really sad though... cuz  it seems like a pretty important project. 
2018-03-16 17:01:35	gjabell	that sucks 
2018-03-16 17:01:44	gjabell	reasons why people should just let the engineers do their job lol 
2018-03-16 17:02:26	jesse	xD but I could just be biased. the common folk might actually prefer these types of pages... 
2018-03-16 17:02:59	gjabell	xD idk, nice ui is good but it needs to actually have a purpose 
2018-03-16 17:03:24	gjabell	I feel like a lot of people just throw shit on websites bc they've seen other people do it, but don't actually realize why its there 
2018-03-16 17:05:20	jesse	yeah. I recently tried asking myself what the ideal website would look like. What I described to myself was pretty much barebones html haha. 
2018-03-16 17:05:57	gjabell	lol xD 
2018-03-16 17:06:00	jesse	I really like git markdown too. 
2018-03-16 17:06:08	gjabell	yeah md looks really nice 
2018-03-16 17:08:12	jesse	Galen, what is the ideal messaging platform in your opinion? 
2018-03-16 17:08:27	gjabell	hmm 
2018-03-16 17:09:03	gjabell	kind of a hard one, I don't really have a favorite 
2018-03-16 17:09:18	gjabell	I with I had been around when IRC was more in use bc I feel like I would have liked that 
2018-03-16 17:09:36	gjabell	slack is pretty ok esp with the terminal interface but there are some things I don't love about it 
2018-03-16 17:09:47	gjabell	plus it's more of a group messenger than a personal messenger 
2018-03-16 17:10:09	gjabell	I would almost say texting except there isn't really a good way to text between my phone and my computer 
2018-03-16 17:10:12	gjabell	at least not that I've found 
2018-03-16 17:10:20	gjabell	and I'm way faster at type on my computer lol 
2018-03-16 17:11:28	gjabell	wbu? 
2018-03-16 17:16:26	jesse	and texting is bad for group messaging.
2018-03-16 17:16:26		i would have liked IRC to become the universal norm. personal and group messaging is done well, and there isn't apple or Verizon telling you who you can and can't text. it's probably not all that secure, but it could be made secure pretty easily i think.
2018-03-16 17:16:26		i feel like the norm now is facebook messenger, but I don't like Facebook. 
2018-03-16 17:16:48	gjabell	yeah same 
2018-03-16 17:16:53	gjabell	I think it can be pretty secure with SSL 
2018-03-16 17:16:57	gjabell	which most servers support 
2018-03-16 17:17:36	gjabell	my main problems with messenger is a) their apps suck and there aren't alternatives b) I don't want people being able to tell when I've read something c) fuck facebook 
2018-03-16 17:17:38	gjabell	xD 
2018-03-16 17:18:08	jesse	I was just typing that i really hate read receipts haha.. 
2018-03-16 17:18:43	gjabell	it bugs me bc I can't actually open messenger and read someone's message until I'm ready to respond, otherwise they'll think I'm ignoring them 
2018-03-16 17:18:56	jesse	right?! 
2018-03-16 17:19:27	gjabell	plus their emojis are the worst 
2018-03-16 17:19:33	gjabell	well, maybe not quite as bad as groupme 
2018-03-16 17:19:36	gjabell	but close 
2018-03-16 17:19:43	jesse	I miss the text emojis. 
2018-03-16 17:19:52	gjabell	exactly 
2018-03-16 17:20:03	gjabell	although I guess it's hard to make an eggplant with text emojies lol 
2018-03-16 17:20:23	jesse	?(?????)?    
2018-03-16 17:20:23		me at FB ^ 
2018-03-16 17:20:50	gjabell	lol xD 
2018-03-16 17:21:15	gjabell	have you heard of matrix? 
2018-03-16 17:21:21	jesse	nope 
2018-03-16 17:22:02	gjabell	https://matrix.org/ 
2018-03-16 17:22:03	jesse	when youre cool enough to have a big enough group of nerdy linux friends, we should make an irc channel :P 
2018-03-16 17:22:20	gjabell	this is kind of similar I think, it's basically decentralized chat 
2018-03-16 17:22:50	gjabell	I was actually going to set up an irc server once I finish reconfiguring stuff xD 
2018-03-16 17:23:00	gjabell	although I kind of want to try making a matrix server too 
2018-03-16 17:24:59	jesse	my browser seems to be struggling loading matrix.org 
2018-03-16 17:25:11	gjabell	yeah mine too lol 
2018-03-16 17:25:16	gjabell	I wasn't sure if it was just me xD 
2018-03-16 17:25:29	jesse	Haha 
2018-03-16 17:25:46	gjabell	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_(communication_protocol) 
2018-03-16 17:26:54	gjabell	it's neat bc you can self host it (since it's decentralized), and it's end-to-end encrypted 
2018-03-16 17:27:07	gjabell	so in theory, you control the full access of the info 
2018-03-16 17:27:59	jesse	seems pretty sweet. but only nerds like us would use it haha 
2018-03-16 17:28:08	gjabell	yeah ik that's the issue xD 
2018-03-16 17:28:11	jesse	which may just be what we need. 
2018-03-16 17:28:14	gjabell	^ 
2018-03-16 17:28:15	jesse	who needs normies 
2018-03-16 17:28:33	gjabell	it does have a web client and native gui clients I think, so it might be of some interest to non techies lol 
2018-03-16 17:28:55	gjabell	it's similar to slack or irc in terms of how it operates I think, with rooms, etc. 
2018-03-16 17:29:43	jesse	I like that setup 
2018-03-16 17:29:58	gjabell	yeah I think it works fairly well 
2018-03-16 17:30:03	gjabell	esp with the right client 
2018-03-16 17:30:29	jesse	hold on 
2018-03-16 17:30:52	jesse	ahh I was testing if the terminal slack thing had multi-line support 
2018-03-16 17:31:00	gjabell	ah 
2018-03-16 17:31:02	gjabell	does it not? 
2018-03-16 17:31:06	gjabell	test 
2018-03-16 17:31:08	gjabell	nope 
2018-03-16 17:31:09	gjabell	rip 
2018-03-16 17:31:11	jesse	thats okay 
2018-03-16 17:31:17	gjabell	what about\n 
2018-03-16 17:31:19	gjabell	dran 
2018-03-16 17:31:29	jesse	reducing memory/cpu usage is my primary concern 
2018-03-16 17:31:35	gjabell	yeah 
2018-03-16 17:32:08	jesse	sadly internet browsers main goal is to use up every resource 
2018-03-16 17:32:15	gjabell	xD 
2018-03-16 17:32:25	gjabell	if (hasMoreRam) useMoreRam() 
2018-03-16 17:32:39	gjabell	or rather while(hasMoreRam) useMoreRam() 
2018-03-16 17:33:08	gjabell	I've been using firefox over chrome lately 
2018-03-16 17:33:19	gjabell	kinda getting tired of chrome, the android app is shit atm lol 
2018-03-16 17:33:29	gjabell	and I gotta say, firefox has some nice features 
2018-03-16 17:40:26	gjabell	have you tried ncmpcpp yet? :) 
2018-03-16 17:41:38	jesse	I've been using firefox too... Do you use firefox on mobile? and I've been trying to get ncmpcpp to work as I've been messaging you haha. I might be having a python3 vs python2 problem again. 
2018-03-16 17:42:03	gjabell	yeah I have been, the chrome app has been unusable lately for me, keeps freezing and shit 
2018-03-16 17:42:05	gjabell	xD nice 
2018-03-16 17:42:26	gjabell	I don't think it requires python 
2018-03-16 17:42:32	gjabell	or do you mean for the backend 
2018-03-16 17:44:34	jesse	I think I mean for the backend. gmusic doesn't seem to be working right. 
2018-03-16 17:44:47	gjabell	did you install mopidy? 
2018-03-16 17:45:08	jesse	although its possible I just didn't install the gmusic extension haha 
2018-03-16 17:45:16	gjabell	xD 
2018-03-16 17:45:19	gjabell	that'd do it lol 
2018-03-16 17:45:54	gjabell	looks like you need mopidy and mopidy-gmusic 
2018-03-16 17:46:14	gjabell	or mopidy-gmusic-git if you want to use AUR 
2018-03-16 17:46:40	gjabell	https://github.com/mopidy/mopidy-gmusic 
2018-03-16 17:46:54	gjabell	and then add your creds to the config file 
2018-03-16 17:50:42	jesse	python-mechanicalsoup seems to be causing yaourt to go in a loop 
2018-03-16 17:51:33	jesse	ill try the git version maybe 
2018-03-16 17:51:40	gjabell	hmm 
2018-03-16 17:51:41	gjabell	weird 
2018-03-16 18:06:25	jesse	its running now, but it cant seem to find any songs... but the server has some logs about 12 playlists.. 
2018-03-16 18:06:53	gjabell	did you just load up ncmpcpp? 
2018-03-16 18:08:24	jesse	yep 
2018-03-16 18:08:28	gjabell	try hitting 2 
2018-03-16 18:08:37	gjabell	which should show your playlists 
2018-03-16 18:08:44	gjabell	for me, it shows both local and spotify 
2018-03-16 18:09:00	jesse	Oh dang! that did it.  
2018-03-16 18:09:20	gjabell	and then if you hit enter on one of the playlists, it'll load it into your current playlist 
2018-03-16 18:09:27	gjabell	which shows up if you hit 1 
2018-03-16 18:10:11	jesse	although it seems to think that every song I own is from Staind haha 
2018-03-16 18:10:19	gjabell	lol xD 
2018-03-16 18:10:56	jesse	its probably cuz i don't know what im doing 
2018-03-16 18:11:14	gjabell	I think it should just be pulling the data from google play music 
2018-03-16 18:11:20	gjabell	could be that the plugin is glitched 
2018-03-16 18:11:56	jesse	WO I can fetch lyrics 
2018-03-16 18:12:10	gjabell	I can walk you through setting up the music visualizer if you want too, it's under 8 but you have to do some setup first 
2018-03-16 18:14:14	jesse	i just wanna know how to select music to play haha 
2018-03-16 18:14:21	gjabell	lol 
2018-03-16 18:14:34	gjabell	if you enter one of the playlists on the 2 page it should just start playing 
2018-03-16 18:14:35	jesse	I selected a song from Papa roach and suddenly Boston- more than a feeling came on 
2018-03-16 18:14:38	gjabell	that's what it does for me at least 
2018-03-16 18:14:40	gjabell	lol 
2018-03-16 18:14:57	gjabell	you can also edit playlists on 5 
2018-03-16 18:19:03	jesse	this is hilariously buggy 
2018-03-16 18:19:29	gjabell	damn xD idk why it's not working for you, everything works pretty well for me 
2018-03-16 18:20:57	jesse	I don't want to mess with this because I want to show you how great this is. to select songs from papa roach and get something vastly different 
2018-03-16 18:21:10	gjabell	xD 
2018-03-16 18:21:19	jesse	I hope Mozart returns Pink Floyd 
2018-03-16 18:21:25	gjabell	that'd be pretty great 
2018-03-16 18:23:03	jesse	Ok so if i hit Enter about 4 or 5 times it gets to the song I was looking for. 
2018-03-16 18:23:12	gjabell	problem solved! 
2018-03-16 18:23:16	jesse	now I just need enter to be a hotkey for itself 5 times 
2018-03-16 18:23:22	gjabell	lol 
2018-03-16 18:23:27	gjabell	rebind your enter key xD 
2018-03-16 18:23:55	jesse	Gosh I wonder whats happening to make it do this funky stuff. and also if this will run without running 'startx' 
2018-03-16 18:24:07	gjabell	yeah that's weird 
2018-03-16 18:24:13	gjabell	I would think it should be able to 
2018-03-16 18:24:49	jesse	It may be queuing songs or something 
2018-03-16 18:25:17	gjabell	it's certainly possible 
2018-03-16 18:25:30	gjabell	or maybe you just have like 20 copies of all your songs in your playlist 
2018-03-16 18:25:35	gjabell	xD 
2018-03-16 18:26:55	jesse	xD 
2018-03-16 18:28:32	jesse	Ok I know that isn't it.. I wonder if it has some sort of prioritization based on how many times I hit a song. 
2018-03-16 18:28:47	gjabell	hmm 
2018-03-16 18:28:50	gjabell	I don't think it does 
2018-03-16 18:29:04	gjabell	although idk if gplay organizes things differently than spotify 
2018-03-16 18:34:07	jesse	im gonna try a different version of ncmpcpp 
2018-03-16 18:34:16	jesse	maybe git will serve me better 
2018-03-16 18:34:16	gjabell	which one did you get 
2018-03-16 18:34:19	gjabell	ah 
2018-03-16 18:34:21	jesse	the one in yaourt 
2018-03-16 18:34:43	gjabell	the default one from pacman worked well for me 
2018-03-16 18:35:10	jesse	blasphemy 
2018-03-16 18:35:15	gjabell	xD 
2018-03-16 18:37:27	jesse	do you typically go for the -git packages in AUR or just the regular versions? 
2018-03-16 18:38:02	gjabell	depends, generally I'll go with the regulars but I will often check to see if one is out of date 
2018-03-16 18:50:12	jesse	well. I guess its kinda a fun bug. I'll show ya some time. It has some sort of pattern to it, but it isn't entirely obvious what's going on. 
2018-03-16 19:35:17		getting channel history...
2018-03-16 15:01:49	gjabell	that's weird, it worked fine for me 
2018-03-16 15:10:07	jesse	@jesse uploaded a file: https://sturgill-operators.slack.com/files/U3VPX29FW/F9S7E8DEJ/cool.png (cool) 
2018-03-16 15:12:10	gjabell	xD 
2018-03-16 15:12:13	gjabell	that's sweet 
2018-03-16 15:12:21	gjabell	looks like fallout pip-boy lol 
2018-03-16 15:13:44	jesse	xD I never played that game but i've seen others play it. 
2018-03-16 15:14:14	jesse	also I wanted to make you open up the website once more. 
2018-03-16 15:14:26	gjabell	lol xD 
2018-03-16 15:14:38	gjabell	unf idk if thgere's a way to display images directly in weechat 
2018-03-16 15:14:53	jesse	w3m can do it. 
2018-03-16 15:15:14	gjabell	gotta be some way then xD 
2018-03-16 15:15:24	gjabell	probably a plugin out there, or you could write one yourself lol 
2018-03-16 15:16:03	jesse	mehhhhh. 
2018-03-16 15:16:13	jesse	i'm gonna play video games or go on a walk instead 
2018-03-16 15:16:20	gjabell	yeah seems like a better idea 
2018-03-16 15:16:26	gjabell	I should probably get outside too lol 
2018-03-16 15:23:58	jesse	I figured out the autoconfig thing. turns out autoload was supposed to be a directory... not a filename 
2018-03-16 15:24:06	gjabell	ah 
2018-03-16 15:24:07	gjabell	nice 
2018-03-16 16:40:43	jesse	hey hows computer security goin for ya? 
2018-03-16 16:41:37	gjabell	I've really been enjoying it 
2018-03-16 16:41:50	gjabell	makes me feel like a leet hax0r lol 
2018-03-16 16:42:18	gjabell	the teacher is a bit hard to follow sometimes bc he'll kinda just spew information from a slide, but it hasn't been too bad 
2018-03-16 16:42:25	gjabell	plus the projects are really cool 
2018-03-16 16:45:08	jesse	thats cool. i wanna hack stuff lol. i feel pretty bored at school cuz none of the problems are challenging... they're just super time consuming or memorization. :( 
2018-03-16 16:45:24	gjabell	yeah I feel that 
2018-03-16 16:45:36	gjabell	I've just been trying to do a bunch of side projects to keep me busy 
2018-03-16 16:45:48	gjabell	although it's hard to finish them lol cause I get demotivated xD 
2018-03-16 16:48:35	jesse	lol. i kinda treat my research like a side project... but I'm getting kinda depressed with the direction it's taking. 
2018-03-16 16:48:49	gjabell	ah, rip 
2018-03-16 16:48:52	gjabell	is it not going well? 
2018-03-16 16:52:52	jesse	its going alright. but we met with people who wanted to design our webpage last week... and what they came up with would make me never want to use the site even if I needed it.
2018-03-16 16:52:52		they wanted parallax scrolling, autosizing text, text flying in from different directions, and menus that drop down whenever the mouse is over it... they even mentioned popups... 
2018-03-16 16:53:08	gjabell	ugh 
2018-03-16 16:53:38	jesse	but from that experience, I learned that I wasnt meant to become a front end developer. 
2018-03-16 16:53:45	gjabell	lol xD 
2018-03-16 16:55:44	jesse	also, they wanted to replace the phrase "rare diseases" with something more positive.... like "unique diseases"..
2018-03-16 16:55:44		If my child was dying, I wouldnt want a website calling the dying child unique... 
2018-03-16 16:56:29	gjabell	lol that's really weird 
2018-03-16 16:56:49	jesse	i almost want to put in confetti animations haha. 
2018-03-16 16:57:19	gjabell	"congrats! your child has a unique disease!" confetti explodes from the sides 
2018-03-16 16:58:15	jesse	haha yeah!! scroll down to learn more about the history of this project before you can search for any real information. 
2018-03-16 16:58:27	gjabell	lol 
2018-03-16 16:59:10	jesse	...lets make the rest of the website invisible unless they watch a 30 minute video on "innovation". 
2018-03-16 16:59:32	gjabell	and that, ladies and gents, is how you ensure no one ever visits your site again 
2018-03-16 17:01:13	jesse	its really sad though... cuz  it seems like a pretty important project. 
2018-03-16 17:01:35	gjabell	that sucks 
2018-03-16 17:01:44	gjabell	reasons why people should just let the engineers do their job lol 
2018-03-16 17:02:26	jesse	xD but I could just be biased. the common folk might actually prefer these types of pages... 
2018-03-16 17:02:59	gjabell	xD idk, nice ui is good but it needs to actually have a purpose 
2018-03-16 17:03:24	gjabell	I feel like a lot of people just throw shit on websites bc they've seen other people do it, but don't actually realize why its there 
2018-03-16 17:05:20	jesse	yeah. I recently tried asking myself what the ideal website would look like. What I described to myself was pretty much barebones html haha. 
2018-03-16 17:05:57	gjabell	lol xD 
2018-03-16 17:06:00	jesse	I really like git markdown too. 
2018-03-16 17:06:08	gjabell	yeah md looks really nice 
2018-03-16 17:08:12	jesse	Galen, what is the ideal messaging platform in your opinion? 
2018-03-16 17:08:27	gjabell	hmm 
2018-03-16 17:09:03	gjabell	kind of a hard one, I don't really have a favorite 
2018-03-16 17:09:18	gjabell	I with I had been around when IRC was more in use bc I feel like I would have liked that 
2018-03-16 17:09:36	gjabell	slack is pretty ok esp with the terminal interface but there are some things I don't love about it 
2018-03-16 17:09:47	gjabell	plus it's more of a group messenger than a personal messenger 
2018-03-16 17:10:09	gjabell	I would almost say texting except there isn't really a good way to text between my phone and my computer 
2018-03-16 17:10:12	gjabell	at least not that I've found 
2018-03-16 17:10:20	gjabell	and I'm way faster at type on my computer lol 
2018-03-16 17:11:28	gjabell	wbu? 
2018-03-16 17:16:26	jesse	and texting is bad for group messaging.
2018-03-16 17:16:26		i would have liked IRC to become the universal norm. personal and group messaging is done well, and there isn't apple or Verizon telling you who you can and can't text. it's probably not all that secure, but it could be made secure pretty easily i think.
2018-03-16 17:16:26		i feel like the norm now is facebook messenger, but I don't like Facebook. 
2018-03-16 17:16:48	gjabell	yeah same 
2018-03-16 17:16:53	gjabell	I think it can be pretty secure with SSL 
2018-03-16 17:16:57	gjabell	which most servers support 
2018-03-16 17:17:36	gjabell	my main problems with messenger is a) their apps suck and there aren't alternatives b) I don't want people being able to tell when I've read something c) fuck facebook 
2018-03-16 17:17:38	gjabell	xD 
2018-03-16 17:18:08	jesse	I was just typing that i really hate read receipts haha.. 
2018-03-16 17:18:43	gjabell	it bugs me bc I can't actually open messenger and read someone's message until I'm ready to respond, otherwise they'll think I'm ignoring them 
2018-03-16 17:18:56	jesse	right?! 
2018-03-16 17:19:27	gjabell	plus their emojis are the worst 
2018-03-16 17:19:33	gjabell	well, maybe not quite as bad as groupme 
2018-03-16 17:19:36	gjabell	but close 
2018-03-16 17:19:43	jesse	I miss the text emojis. 
2018-03-16 17:19:52	gjabell	exactly 
2018-03-16 17:20:03	gjabell	although I guess it's hard to make an eggplant with text emojies lol 
2018-03-16 17:20:23	jesse	?(?????)?    
2018-03-16 17:20:23		me at FB ^ 
2018-03-16 17:20:50	gjabell	lol xD 
2018-03-16 17:21:15	gjabell	have you heard of matrix? 
2018-03-16 17:21:21	jesse	nope 
2018-03-16 17:22:02	gjabell	https://matrix.org/ 
2018-03-16 17:22:03	jesse	when youre cool enough to have a big enough group of nerdy linux friends, we should make an irc channel :P 
2018-03-16 17:22:20	gjabell	this is kind of similar I think, it's basically decentralized chat 
2018-03-16 17:22:50	gjabell	I was actually going to set up an irc server once I finish reconfiguring stuff xD 
2018-03-16 17:23:00	gjabell	although I kind of want to try making a matrix server too 
2018-03-16 17:24:59	jesse	my browser seems to be struggling loading http://matrix.org (matrix.org) 
2018-03-16 17:25:11	gjabell	yeah mine too lol 
2018-03-16 17:25:16	gjabell	I wasn't sure if it was just me xD 
2018-03-16 17:25:29	jesse	Haha 
2018-03-16 17:25:46	gjabell	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_(communication_protocol)
2018-03-16 17:25:46		Wikipedia: Matrix (communication protocol)
2018-03-16 17:25:46		Matrix is an open protocol for real-time communication. It is designed to allow users with accounts at one communications service provider to communicate with users of a different service provider via online chat, Voice over IP, and Videotelephony. That is, it aims to make real-time communication work seamlessly between different service providers, just like standard Simple Mail Transfer Protocol email does now for store-and-forward email service.
2018-03-16 17:25:46		From a technical perspective, it is an application layer communications protocol for federated real-time communication. It provides HTTP APIs and open source reference implementations for securely distributing and persisting messages in JSON format over an open federation of servers. It can integrate with standard web services via WebRTC, facilitating browser-to-browser applications.
2018-03-16 17:25:46		Other attempts at defining an open instant messaging or multimedia signalling protocol of this type and getting it widely adopted (e.g. XMPP and IRCv3) have highlighted the challenges involved, both technological and political. It is unclear if there is enough demand among users for services which interoperate among providers. 
2018-03-16 17:26:54	gjabell	it's neat bc you can self host it (since it's decentralized), and it's end-to-end encrypted 
2018-03-16 17:27:07	gjabell	so in theory, you control the full access of the info 
2018-03-16 17:27:59	jesse	seems pretty sweet. but only nerds like us would use it haha 
2018-03-16 17:28:08	gjabell	yeah ik that's the issue xD 
2018-03-16 17:28:11	jesse	which may just be what we need. 
2018-03-16 17:28:14	gjabell	^ 
2018-03-16 17:28:15	jesse	who needs normies 
2018-03-16 17:28:33	gjabell	it does have a web client and native gui clients I think, so it might be of some interest to non techies lol 
2018-03-16 17:28:55	gjabell	it's similar to slack or irc in terms of how it operates I think, with rooms, etc. 
2018-03-16 17:29:43	jesse	I like that setup 
2018-03-16 17:29:58	gjabell	yeah I think it works fairly well 
2018-03-16 17:30:03	gjabell	esp with the right client 
2018-03-16 17:30:29	jesse	hold on 
2018-03-16 17:30:52	jesse	ahh I was testing if the terminal slack thing had multi-line support 
2018-03-16 17:31:00	gjabell	ah 
2018-03-16 17:31:02	gjabell	does it not? 
2018-03-16 17:31:06	gjabell	test 
2018-03-16 17:31:08	gjabell	nope 
2018-03-16 17:31:09	gjabell	rip 
2018-03-16 17:31:11	jesse	thats okay 
2018-03-16 17:31:17	gjabell	what about\n 
2018-03-16 17:31:19	gjabell	dran 
2018-03-16 17:31:29	jesse	reducing memory/cpu usage is my primary concern 
2018-03-16 17:31:35	gjabell	yeah 
2018-03-16 17:32:08	jesse	sadly internet browsers main goal is to use up every resource 
2018-03-16 17:32:15	gjabell	xD 
2018-03-16 17:32:25	gjabell	if (hasMoreRam) useMoreRam() 
2018-03-16 17:32:39	gjabell	or rather while(hasMoreRam) useMoreRam() 
2018-03-16 17:33:08	gjabell	I've been using firefox over chrome lately 
2018-03-16 17:33:19	gjabell	kinda getting tired of chrome, the android app is shit atm lol 
2018-03-16 17:33:29	gjabell	and I gotta say, firefox has some nice features 
2018-03-16 17:40:26	gjabell	have you tried ncmpcpp yet? :) 
2018-03-16 17:41:38	jesse	I've been using firefox too... Do you use firefox on mobile? and I've been trying to get ncmpcpp to work as I've been messaging you haha. I might be having a python3 vs python2 problem again. 
2018-03-16 17:42:03	gjabell	yeah I have been, the chrome app has been unusable lately for me, keeps freezing and shit 
2018-03-16 17:42:05	gjabell	xD nice 
2018-03-16 17:42:26	gjabell	I don't think it requires python 
2018-03-16 17:42:32	gjabell	or do you mean for the backend 
2018-03-16 17:44:34	jesse	I think I mean for the backend. gmusic doesn't seem to be working right. 
2018-03-16 17:44:47	gjabell	did you install mopidy? 
2018-03-16 17:45:08	jesse	although its possible I just didn't install the gmusic extension haha 
2018-03-16 17:45:16	gjabell	xD 
2018-03-16 17:45:19	gjabell	that'd do it lol 
2018-03-16 17:45:54	gjabell	looks like you need mopidy and mopidy-gmusic 
2018-03-16 17:46:14	gjabell	or mopidy-gmusic-git if you want to use AUR 
2018-03-16 17:46:40	gjabell	https://github.com/mopidy/mopidy-gmusic
2018-03-16 17:46:40		mopidy/mopidy-gmusic
2018-03-16 17:46:40		mopidy-gmusic - Mopidy extension for playing music from Google Play Music 
2018-03-16 17:46:54	gjabell	and then add your creds to the config file 
2018-03-16 17:50:42	jesse	python-mechanicalsoup seems to be causing yaourt to go in a loop 
2018-03-16 17:51:33	jesse	ill try the git version maybe 
2018-03-16 17:51:40	gjabell	hmm 
2018-03-16 17:51:41	gjabell	weird 
2018-03-16 18:06:25	jesse	its running now, but it cant seem to find any songs... but the server has some logs about 12 playlists.. 
2018-03-16 18:06:53	gjabell	did you just load up ncmpcpp? 
2018-03-16 18:08:24	jesse	yep 
2018-03-16 18:08:28	gjabell	try hitting 2 
2018-03-16 18:08:37	gjabell	which should show your playlists 
2018-03-16 18:08:44	gjabell	for me, it shows both local and spotify 
2018-03-16 18:09:00	jesse	Oh dang! that did it.  
2018-03-16 18:09:20	gjabell	and then if you hit enter on one of the playlists, it'll load it into your current playlist 
2018-03-16 18:09:27	gjabell	which shows up if you hit 1 
2018-03-16 18:10:11	jesse	although it seems to think that every song I own is from Staind haha 
2018-03-16 18:10:19	gjabell	lol xD 
2018-03-16 18:10:56	jesse	its probably cuz i don't know what im doing 
2018-03-16 18:11:14	gjabell	I think it should just be pulling the data from google play music 
2018-03-16 18:11:20	gjabell	could be that the plugin is glitched 
2018-03-16 18:11:56	jesse	WO I can fetch lyrics 
2018-03-16 18:12:10	gjabell	I can walk you through setting up the music visualizer if you want too, it's under 8 but you have to do some setup first 
2018-03-16 18:14:14	jesse	i just wanna know how to select music to play haha 
2018-03-16 18:14:21	gjabell	lol 
2018-03-16 18:14:34	gjabell	if you enter one of the playlists on the 2 page it should just start playing 
2018-03-16 18:14:35	jesse	I selected a song from Papa roach and suddenly Boston- more than a feeling came on 
2018-03-16 18:14:38	gjabell	that's what it does for me at least 
2018-03-16 18:14:40	gjabell	lol 
2018-03-16 18:14:57	gjabell	you can also edit playlists on 5 
2018-03-16 18:19:03	jesse	this is hilariously buggy 
2018-03-16 18:19:29	gjabell	damn xD idk why it's not working for you, everything works pretty well for me 
2018-03-16 18:20:57	jesse	I don't want to mess with this because I want to show you how great this is. to select songs from papa roach and get something vastly different 
2018-03-16 18:21:10	gjabell	xD 
2018-03-16 18:21:19	jesse	I hope Mozart returns Pink Floyd 
2018-03-16 18:21:25	gjabell	that'd be pretty great 
2018-03-16 18:23:03	jesse	Ok so if i hit Enter about 4 or 5 times it gets to the song I was looking for. 
2018-03-16 18:23:12	gjabell	problem solved! 
2018-03-16 18:23:16	jesse	now I just need enter to be a hotkey for itself 5 times 
2018-03-16 18:23:22	gjabell	lol 
2018-03-16 18:23:27	gjabell	rebind your enter key xD 
2018-03-16 18:23:55	jesse	Gosh I wonder whats happening to make it do this funky stuff. and also if this will run without running 'startx' 
2018-03-16 18:24:07	gjabell	yeah that's weird 
2018-03-16 18:24:13	gjabell	I would think it should be able to 
2018-03-16 18:24:49	jesse	It may be queuing songs or something 
2018-03-16 18:25:17	gjabell	it's certainly possible 
2018-03-16 18:25:30	gjabell	or maybe you just have like 20 copies of all your songs in your playlist 
2018-03-16 18:25:35	gjabell	xD 
2018-03-16 18:26:55	jesse	xD 
2018-03-16 18:28:32	jesse	Ok I know that isn't it.. I wonder if it has some sort of prioritization based on how many times I hit a song. 
2018-03-16 18:28:47	gjabell	hmm 
2018-03-16 18:28:50	gjabell	I don't think it does 
2018-03-16 18:29:04	gjabell	although idk if gplay organizes things differently than spotify 
2018-03-16 18:34:07	jesse	im gonna try a different version of ncmpcpp 
2018-03-16 18:34:16	jesse	maybe git will serve me better 
2018-03-16 18:34:16	gjabell	which one did you get 
2018-03-16 18:34:19	gjabell	ah 
2018-03-16 18:34:21	jesse	the one in yaourt 
2018-03-16 18:34:43	gjabell	the default one from pacman worked well for me 
2018-03-16 18:35:10	jesse	blasphemy 
2018-03-16 18:35:15	gjabell	xD 
2018-03-16 18:37:27	jesse	do you typically go for the -git packages in AUR or just the regular versions? 
2018-03-16 18:38:02	gjabell	depends, generally I'll go with the regulars but I will often check to see if one is out of date 
2018-03-16 18:50:12	jesse	well. I guess its kinda a fun bug. I'll show ya some time. It has some sort of pattern to it, but it isn't entirely obvious what's going on. 
2018-03-16 18:50:44	gjabell	xD that's really weird 
2018-03-16 22:32:08		getting channel history...
2018-03-16 15:01:49	gjabell	that's weird, it worked fine for me 
2018-03-16 15:10:07	jesse	@jesse uploaded a file: https://sturgill-operators.slack.com/files/U3VPX29FW/F9S7E8DEJ/cool.png (cool) 
2018-03-16 15:12:10	gjabell	xD 
2018-03-16 15:12:13	gjabell	that's sweet 
2018-03-16 15:12:21	gjabell	looks like fallout pip-boy lol 
2018-03-16 15:13:44	jesse	xD I never played that game but i've seen others play it. 
2018-03-16 15:14:14	jesse	also I wanted to make you open up the website once more. 
2018-03-16 15:14:26	gjabell	lol xD 
2018-03-16 15:14:38	gjabell	unf idk if thgere's a way to display images directly in weechat 
2018-03-16 15:14:53	jesse	w3m can do it. 
2018-03-16 15:15:14	gjabell	gotta be some way then xD 
2018-03-16 15:15:24	gjabell	probably a plugin out there, or you could write one yourself lol 
2018-03-16 15:16:03	jesse	mehhhhh. 
2018-03-16 15:16:13	jesse	i'm gonna play video games or go on a walk instead 
2018-03-16 15:16:20	gjabell	yeah seems like a better idea 
2018-03-16 15:16:26	gjabell	I should probably get outside too lol 
2018-03-16 15:23:58	jesse	I figured out the autoconfig thing. turns out autoload was supposed to be a directory... not a filename 
2018-03-16 15:24:06	gjabell	ah 
2018-03-16 15:24:07	gjabell	nice 
2018-03-16 16:40:43	jesse	hey hows computer security goin for ya? 
2018-03-16 16:41:37	gjabell	I've really been enjoying it 
2018-03-16 16:41:50	gjabell	makes me feel like a leet hax0r lol 
2018-03-16 16:42:18	gjabell	the teacher is a bit hard to follow sometimes bc he'll kinda just spew information from a slide, but it hasn't been too bad 
2018-03-16 16:42:25	gjabell	plus the projects are really cool 
2018-03-16 16:45:08	jesse	thats cool. i wanna hack stuff lol. i feel pretty bored at school cuz none of the problems are challenging... they're just super time consuming or memorization. :( 
2018-03-16 16:45:24	gjabell	yeah I feel that 
2018-03-16 16:45:36	gjabell	I've just been trying to do a bunch of side projects to keep me busy 
2018-03-16 16:45:48	gjabell	although it's hard to finish them lol cause I get demotivated xD 
2018-03-16 16:48:35	jesse	lol. i kinda treat my research like a side project... but I'm getting kinda depressed with the direction it's taking. 
2018-03-16 16:48:49	gjabell	ah, rip 
2018-03-16 16:48:52	gjabell	is it not going well? 
2018-03-16 16:52:52	jesse	its going alright. but we met with people who wanted to design our webpage last week... and what they came up with would make me never want to use the site even if I needed it.
2018-03-16 16:52:52		they wanted parallax scrolling, autosizing text, text flying in from different directions, and menus that drop down whenever the mouse is over it... they even mentioned popups... 
2018-03-16 16:53:08	gjabell	ugh 
2018-03-16 16:53:38	jesse	but from that experience, I learned that I wasnt meant to become a front end developer. 
2018-03-16 16:53:45	gjabell	lol xD 
2018-03-16 16:55:44	jesse	also, they wanted to replace the phrase "rare diseases" with something more positive.... like "unique diseases"..
2018-03-16 16:55:44		If my child was dying, I wouldnt want a website calling the dying child unique... 
2018-03-16 16:56:29	gjabell	lol that's really weird 
2018-03-16 16:56:49	jesse	i almost want to put in confetti animations haha. 
2018-03-16 16:57:19	gjabell	"congrats! your child has a unique disease!" confetti explodes from the sides 
2018-03-16 16:58:15	jesse	haha yeah!! scroll down to learn more about the history of this project before you can search for any real information. 
2018-03-16 16:58:27	gjabell	lol 
2018-03-16 16:59:10	jesse	...lets make the rest of the website invisible unless they watch a 30 minute video on "innovation". 
2018-03-16 16:59:32	gjabell	and that, ladies and gents, is how you ensure no one ever visits your site again 
2018-03-16 17:01:13	jesse	its really sad though... cuz  it seems like a pretty important project. 
2018-03-16 17:01:35	gjabell	that sucks 
2018-03-16 17:01:44	gjabell	reasons why people should just let the engineers do their job lol 
2018-03-16 17:02:26	jesse	xD but I could just be biased. the common folk might actually prefer these types of pages... 
2018-03-16 17:02:59	gjabell	xD idk, nice ui is good but it needs to actually have a purpose 
2018-03-16 17:03:24	gjabell	I feel like a lot of people just throw shit on websites bc they've seen other people do it, but don't actually realize why its there 
2018-03-16 17:05:20	jesse	yeah. I recently tried asking myself what the ideal website would look like. What I described to myself was pretty much barebones html haha. 
2018-03-16 17:05:57	gjabell	lol xD 
2018-03-16 17:06:00	jesse	I really like git markdown too. 
2018-03-16 17:06:08	gjabell	yeah md looks really nice 
2018-03-16 17:08:12	jesse	Galen, what is the ideal messaging platform in your opinion? 
2018-03-16 17:08:27	gjabell	hmm 
2018-03-16 17:09:03	gjabell	kind of a hard one, I don't really have a favorite 
2018-03-16 17:09:18	gjabell	I with I had been around when IRC was more in use bc I feel like I would have liked that 
2018-03-16 17:09:36	gjabell	slack is pretty ok esp with the terminal interface but there are some things I don't love about it 
2018-03-16 17:09:47	gjabell	plus it's more of a group messenger than a personal messenger 
2018-03-16 17:10:09	gjabell	I would almost say texting except there isn't really a good way to text between my phone and my computer 
2018-03-16 17:10:12	gjabell	at least not that I've found 
2018-03-16 17:10:20	gjabell	and I'm way faster at type on my computer lol 
2018-03-16 17:11:28	gjabell	wbu? 
2018-03-16 17:16:26	jesse	and texting is bad for group messaging.
2018-03-16 17:16:26		i would have liked IRC to become the universal norm. personal and group messaging is done well, and there isn't apple or Verizon telling you who you can and can't text. it's probably not all that secure, but it could be made secure pretty easily i think.
2018-03-16 17:16:26		i feel like the norm now is facebook messenger, but I don't like Facebook. 
2018-03-16 17:16:48	gjabell	yeah same 
2018-03-16 17:16:53	gjabell	I think it can be pretty secure with SSL 
2018-03-16 17:16:57	gjabell	which most servers support 
2018-03-16 17:17:36	gjabell	my main problems with messenger is a) their apps suck and there aren't alternatives b) I don't want people being able to tell when I've read something c) fuck facebook 
2018-03-16 17:17:38	gjabell	xD 
2018-03-16 17:18:08	jesse	I was just typing that i really hate read receipts haha.. 
2018-03-16 17:18:43	gjabell	it bugs me bc I can't actually open messenger and read someone's message until I'm ready to respond, otherwise they'll think I'm ignoring them 
2018-03-16 17:18:56	jesse	right?! 
2018-03-16 17:19:27	gjabell	plus their emojis are the worst 
2018-03-16 17:19:33	gjabell	well, maybe not quite as bad as groupme 
2018-03-16 17:19:36	gjabell	but close 
2018-03-16 17:19:43	jesse	I miss the text emojis. 
2018-03-16 17:19:52	gjabell	exactly 
2018-03-16 17:20:03	gjabell	although I guess it's hard to make an eggplant with text emojies lol 
2018-03-16 17:20:23	jesse	?(?????)?    
2018-03-16 17:20:23		me at FB ^ 
2018-03-16 17:20:50	gjabell	lol xD 
2018-03-16 17:21:15	gjabell	have you heard of matrix? 
2018-03-16 17:21:21	jesse	nope 
2018-03-16 17:22:02	gjabell	https://matrix.org/ 
2018-03-16 17:22:03	jesse	when youre cool enough to have a big enough group of nerdy linux friends, we should make an irc channel :P 
2018-03-16 17:22:20	gjabell	this is kind of similar I think, it's basically decentralized chat 
2018-03-16 17:22:50	gjabell	I was actually going to set up an irc server once I finish reconfiguring stuff xD 
2018-03-16 17:23:00	gjabell	although I kind of want to try making a matrix server too 
2018-03-16 17:24:59	jesse	my browser seems to be struggling loading http://matrix.org (matrix.org) 
2018-03-16 17:25:11	gjabell	yeah mine too lol 
2018-03-16 17:25:16	gjabell	I wasn't sure if it was just me xD 
2018-03-16 17:25:29	jesse	Haha 
2018-03-16 17:25:46	gjabell	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_(communication_protocol)
2018-03-16 17:25:46		Wikipedia: Matrix (communication protocol)
2018-03-16 17:25:46		Matrix is an open protocol for real-time communication. It is designed to allow users with accounts at one communications service provider to communicate with users of a different service provider via online chat, Voice over IP, and Videotelephony. That is, it aims to make real-time communication work seamlessly between different service providers, just like standard Simple Mail Transfer Protocol email does now for store-and-forward email service.
2018-03-16 17:25:46		From a technical perspective, it is an application layer communications protocol for federated real-time communication. It provides HTTP APIs and open source reference implementations for securely distributing and persisting messages in JSON format over an open federation of servers. It can integrate with standard web services via WebRTC, facilitating browser-to-browser applications.
2018-03-16 17:25:46		Other attempts at defining an open instant messaging or multimedia signalling protocol of this type and getting it widely adopted (e.g. XMPP and IRCv3) have highlighted the challenges involved, both technological and political. It is unclear if there is enough demand among users for services which interoperate among providers. 
2018-03-16 17:26:54	gjabell	it's neat bc you can self host it (since it's decentralized), and it's end-to-end encrypted 
2018-03-16 17:27:07	gjabell	so in theory, you control the full access of the info 
2018-03-16 17:27:59	jesse	seems pretty sweet. but only nerds like us would use it haha 
2018-03-16 17:28:08	gjabell	yeah ik that's the issue xD 
2018-03-16 17:28:11	jesse	which may just be what we need. 
2018-03-16 17:28:14	gjabell	^ 
2018-03-16 17:28:15	jesse	who needs normies 
2018-03-16 17:28:33	gjabell	it does have a web client and native gui clients I think, so it might be of some interest to non techies lol 
2018-03-16 17:28:55	gjabell	it's similar to slack or irc in terms of how it operates I think, with rooms, etc. 
2018-03-16 17:29:43	jesse	I like that setup 
2018-03-16 17:29:58	gjabell	yeah I think it works fairly well 
2018-03-16 17:30:03	gjabell	esp with the right client 
2018-03-16 17:30:29	jesse	hold on 
2018-03-16 17:30:52	jesse	ahh I was testing if the terminal slack thing had multi-line support 
2018-03-16 17:31:00	gjabell	ah 
2018-03-16 17:31:02	gjabell	does it not? 
2018-03-16 17:31:06	gjabell	test 
2018-03-16 17:31:08	gjabell	nope 
2018-03-16 17:31:09	gjabell	rip 
2018-03-16 17:31:11	jesse	thats okay 
2018-03-16 17:31:17	gjabell	what about\n 
2018-03-16 17:31:19	gjabell	dran 
2018-03-16 17:31:29	jesse	reducing memory/cpu usage is my primary concern 
2018-03-16 17:31:35	gjabell	yeah 
2018-03-16 17:32:08	jesse	sadly internet browsers main goal is to use up every resource 
2018-03-16 17:32:15	gjabell	xD 
2018-03-16 17:32:25	gjabell	if (hasMoreRam) useMoreRam() 
2018-03-16 17:32:39	gjabell	or rather while(hasMoreRam) useMoreRam() 
2018-03-16 17:33:08	gjabell	I've been using firefox over chrome lately 
2018-03-16 17:33:19	gjabell	kinda getting tired of chrome, the android app is shit atm lol 
2018-03-16 17:33:29	gjabell	and I gotta say, firefox has some nice features 
2018-03-16 17:40:26	gjabell	have you tried ncmpcpp yet? :) 
2018-03-16 17:41:38	jesse	I've been using firefox too... Do you use firefox on mobile? and I've been trying to get ncmpcpp to work as I've been messaging you haha. I might be having a python3 vs python2 problem again. 
2018-03-16 17:42:03	gjabell	yeah I have been, the chrome app has been unusable lately for me, keeps freezing and shit 
2018-03-16 17:42:05	gjabell	xD nice 
2018-03-16 17:42:26	gjabell	I don't think it requires python 
2018-03-16 17:42:32	gjabell	or do you mean for the backend 
2018-03-16 17:44:34	jesse	I think I mean for the backend. gmusic doesn't seem to be working right. 
2018-03-16 17:44:47	gjabell	did you install mopidy? 
2018-03-16 17:45:08	jesse	although its possible I just didn't install the gmusic extension haha 
2018-03-16 17:45:16	gjabell	xD 
2018-03-16 17:45:19	gjabell	that'd do it lol 
2018-03-16 17:45:54	gjabell	looks like you need mopidy and mopidy-gmusic 
2018-03-16 17:46:14	gjabell	or mopidy-gmusic-git if you want to use AUR 
2018-03-16 17:46:40	gjabell	https://github.com/mopidy/mopidy-gmusic
2018-03-16 17:46:40		mopidy/mopidy-gmusic
2018-03-16 17:46:40		mopidy-gmusic - Mopidy extension for playing music from Google Play Music 
2018-03-16 17:46:54	gjabell	and then add your creds to the config file 
2018-03-16 17:50:42	jesse	python-mechanicalsoup seems to be causing yaourt to go in a loop 
2018-03-16 17:51:33	jesse	ill try the git version maybe 
2018-03-16 17:51:40	gjabell	hmm 
2018-03-16 17:51:41	gjabell	weird 
2018-03-16 18:06:25	jesse	its running now, but it cant seem to find any songs... but the server has some logs about 12 playlists.. 
2018-03-16 18:06:53	gjabell	did you just load up ncmpcpp? 
2018-03-16 18:08:24	jesse	yep 
2018-03-16 18:08:28	gjabell	try hitting 2 
2018-03-16 18:08:37	gjabell	which should show your playlists 
2018-03-16 18:08:44	gjabell	for me, it shows both local and spotify 
2018-03-16 18:09:00	jesse	Oh dang! that did it.  
2018-03-16 18:09:20	gjabell	and then if you hit enter on one of the playlists, it'll load it into your current playlist 
2018-03-16 18:09:27	gjabell	which shows up if you hit 1 
2018-03-16 18:10:11	jesse	although it seems to think that every song I own is from Staind haha 
2018-03-16 18:10:19	gjabell	lol xD 
2018-03-16 18:10:56	jesse	its probably cuz i don't know what im doing 
2018-03-16 18:11:14	gjabell	I think it should just be pulling the data from google play music 
2018-03-16 18:11:20	gjabell	could be that the plugin is glitched 
2018-03-16 18:11:56	jesse	WO I can fetch lyrics 
2018-03-16 18:12:10	gjabell	I can walk you through setting up the music visualizer if you want too, it's under 8 but you have to do some setup first 
2018-03-16 18:14:14	jesse	i just wanna know how to select music to play haha 
2018-03-16 18:14:21	gjabell	lol 
2018-03-16 18:14:34	gjabell	if you enter one of the playlists on the 2 page it should just start playing 
2018-03-16 18:14:35	jesse	I selected a song from Papa roach and suddenly Boston- more than a feeling came on 
2018-03-16 18:14:38	gjabell	that's what it does for me at least 
2018-03-16 18:14:40	gjabell	lol 
2018-03-16 18:14:57	gjabell	you can also edit playlists on 5 
2018-03-16 18:19:03	jesse	this is hilariously buggy 
2018-03-16 18:19:29	gjabell	damn xD idk why it's not working for you, everything works pretty well for me 
2018-03-16 18:20:57	jesse	I don't want to mess with this because I want to show you how great this is. to select songs from papa roach and get something vastly different 
2018-03-16 18:21:10	gjabell	xD 
2018-03-16 18:21:19	jesse	I hope Mozart returns Pink Floyd 
2018-03-16 18:21:25	gjabell	that'd be pretty great 
2018-03-16 18:23:03	jesse	Ok so if i hit Enter about 4 or 5 times it gets to the song I was looking for. 
2018-03-16 18:23:12	gjabell	problem solved! 
2018-03-16 18:23:16	jesse	now I just need enter to be a hotkey for itself 5 times 
2018-03-16 18:23:22	gjabell	lol 
2018-03-16 18:23:27	gjabell	rebind your enter key xD 
2018-03-16 18:23:55	jesse	Gosh I wonder whats happening to make it do this funky stuff. and also if this will run without running 'startx' 
2018-03-16 18:24:07	gjabell	yeah that's weird 
2018-03-16 18:24:13	gjabell	I would think it should be able to 
2018-03-16 18:24:49	jesse	It may be queuing songs or something 
2018-03-16 18:25:17	gjabell	it's certainly possible 
2018-03-16 18:25:30	gjabell	or maybe you just have like 20 copies of all your songs in your playlist 
2018-03-16 18:25:35	gjabell	xD 
2018-03-16 18:26:55	jesse	xD 
2018-03-16 18:28:32	jesse	Ok I know that isn't it.. I wonder if it has some sort of prioritization based on how many times I hit a song. 
2018-03-16 18:28:47	gjabell	hmm 
2018-03-16 18:28:50	gjabell	I don't think it does 
2018-03-16 18:29:04	gjabell	although idk if gplay organizes things differently than spotify 
2018-03-16 18:34:07	jesse	im gonna try a different version of ncmpcpp 
2018-03-16 18:34:16	jesse	maybe git will serve me better 
2018-03-16 18:34:16	gjabell	which one did you get 
2018-03-16 18:34:19	gjabell	ah 
2018-03-16 18:34:21	jesse	the one in yaourt 
2018-03-16 18:34:43	gjabell	the default one from pacman worked well for me 
2018-03-16 18:35:10	jesse	blasphemy 
2018-03-16 18:35:15	gjabell	xD 
2018-03-16 18:37:27	jesse	do you typically go for the -git packages in AUR or just the regular versions? 
2018-03-16 18:38:02	gjabell	depends, generally I'll go with the regulars but I will often check to see if one is out of date 
2018-03-16 18:50:12	jesse	well. I guess its kinda a fun bug. I'll show ya some time. It has some sort of pattern to it, but it isn't entirely obvious what's going on. 
2018-03-16 18:50:44	gjabell	xD that's really weird 
2018-03-16 22:38:39	jesse	Tested, the music player works without startx

2018-03-16 15:12:13	gjabell	that's sweet 
2018-03-16 15:12:21	gjabell	looks like fallout pip-boy lol 
2018-03-16 15:13:44	jesse	xD I never played that game but i've seen others play it. 
2018-03-16 15:14:14	jesse	also I wanted to make you open up the website once more. 
2018-03-16 15:14:26	gjabell	lol xD 
2018-03-16 15:14:38	gjabell	unf idk if thgere's a way to display images directly in weechat 
2018-03-16 15:14:53	jesse	w3m can do it. 
2018-03-16 15:15:14	gjabell	gotta be some way then xD 
2018-03-16 15:15:24	gjabell	probably a plugin out there, or you could write one yourself lol 
2018-03-16 15:16:03	jesse	mehhhhh. 
2018-03-16 15:16:13	jesse	i'm gonna play video games or go on a walk instead 
2018-03-16 15:16:20	gjabell	yeah seems like a better idea 
2018-03-16 15:16:26	gjabell	I should probably get outside too lol 
2018-03-16 15:23:58	jesse	I figured out the autoconfig thing. turns out autoload was supposed to be a directory... not a filename 
2018-03-16 15:24:06	gjabell	ah 
2018-03-16 15:24:07	gjabell	nice 
2018-03-16 16:40:43	jesse	hey hows computer security goin for ya? 
2018-03-16 16:41:37	gjabell	I've really been enjoying it 
2018-03-16 16:41:50	gjabell	makes me feel like a leet hax0r lol 
2018-03-16 16:42:18	gjabell	the teacher is a bit hard to follow sometimes bc he'll kinda just spew information from a slide, but it hasn't been too bad 
2018-03-16 16:42:25	gjabell	plus the projects are really cool 
2018-03-16 16:45:08	jesse	thats cool. i wanna hack stuff lol. i feel pretty bored at school cuz none of the problems are challenging... they're just super time consuming or memorization. :( 
2018-03-16 16:45:24	gjabell	yeah I feel that 
2018-03-16 16:45:36	gjabell	I've just been trying to do a bunch of side projects to keep me busy 
2018-03-16 16:45:48	gjabell	although it's hard to finish them lol cause I get demotivated xD 
2018-03-16 16:48:35	jesse	lol. i kinda treat my research like a side project... but I'm getting kinda depressed with the direction it's taking. 
2018-03-16 16:48:49	gjabell	ah, rip 
2018-03-16 16:48:52	gjabell	is it not going well? 
2018-03-16 16:52:52	jesse	its going alright. but we met with people who wanted to design our webpage last week... and what they came up with would make me never want to use the site even if I needed it.
2018-03-16 16:52:52		they wanted parallax scrolling, autosizing text, text flying in from different directions, and menus that drop down whenever the mouse is over it... they even mentioned popups... 
2018-03-16 16:53:08	gjabell	ugh 
2018-03-16 16:53:38	jesse	but from that experience, I learned that I wasnt meant to become a front end developer. 
2018-03-16 16:53:45	gjabell	lol xD 
2018-03-16 16:55:44	jesse	also, they wanted to replace the phrase "rare diseases" with something more positive.... like "unique diseases"..
2018-03-16 16:55:44		If my child was dying, I wouldnt want a website calling the dying child unique... 
2018-03-16 16:56:29	gjabell	lol that's really weird 
2018-03-16 16:56:49	jesse	i almost want to put in confetti animations haha. 
2018-03-16 16:57:19	gjabell	"congrats! your child has a unique disease!" confetti explodes from the sides 
2018-03-16 16:58:15	jesse	haha yeah!! scroll down to learn more about the history of this project before you can search for any real information. 
2018-03-16 16:58:27	gjabell	lol 
2018-03-16 16:59:10	jesse	...lets make the rest of the website invisible unless they watch a 30 minute video on "innovation". 
2018-03-16 16:59:32	gjabell	and that, ladies and gents, is how you ensure no one ever visits your site again 
2018-03-16 17:01:13	jesse	its really sad though... cuz  it seems like a pretty important project. 
2018-03-16 17:01:35	gjabell	that sucks 
2018-03-16 17:01:44	gjabell	reasons why people should just let the engineers do their job lol 
2018-03-16 17:02:26	jesse	xD but I could just be biased. the common folk might actually prefer these types of pages... 
2018-03-16 17:02:59	gjabell	xD idk, nice ui is good but it needs to actually have a purpose 
2018-03-16 17:03:24	gjabell	I feel like a lot of people just throw shit on websites bc they've seen other people do it, but don't actually realize why its there 
2018-03-16 17:05:20	jesse	yeah. I recently tried asking myself what the ideal website would look like. What I described to myself was pretty much barebones html haha. 
2018-03-16 17:05:57	gjabell	lol xD 
2018-03-16 17:06:00	jesse	I really like git markdown too. 
2018-03-16 17:06:08	gjabell	yeah md looks really nice 
2018-03-16 17:08:12	jesse	Galen, what is the ideal messaging platform in your opinion? 
2018-03-16 17:08:27	gjabell	hmm 
2018-03-16 17:09:03	gjabell	kind of a hard one, I don't really have a favorite 
2018-03-16 17:09:18	gjabell	I with I had been around when IRC was more in use bc I feel like I would have liked that 
2018-03-16 17:09:36	gjabell	slack is pretty ok esp with the terminal interface but there are some things I don't love about it 
2018-03-16 17:09:47	gjabell	plus it's more of a group messenger than a personal messenger 
2018-03-16 17:10:09	gjabell	I would almost say texting except there isn't really a good way to text between my phone and my computer 
2018-03-16 17:10:12	gjabell	at least not that I've found 
2018-03-16 17:10:20	gjabell	and I'm way faster at type on my computer lol 
2018-03-16 17:11:28	gjabell	wbu? 
2018-03-16 17:16:26	jesse	and texting is bad for group messaging.
2018-03-16 17:16:26		i would have liked IRC to become the universal norm. personal and group messaging is done well, and there isn't apple or Verizon telling you who you can and can't text. it's probably not all that secure, but it could be made secure pretty easily i think.
2018-03-16 17:16:26		i feel like the norm now is facebook messenger, but I don't like Facebook. 
2018-03-16 17:16:48	gjabell	yeah same 
2018-03-16 17:16:53	gjabell	I think it can be pretty secure with SSL 
2018-03-16 17:16:57	gjabell	which most servers support 
2018-03-16 17:17:36	gjabell	my main problems with messenger is a) their apps suck and there aren't alternatives b) I don't want people being able to tell when I've read something c) fuck facebook 
2018-03-16 17:17:38	gjabell	xD 
2018-03-16 17:18:08	jesse	I was just typing that i really hate read receipts haha.. 
2018-03-16 17:18:43	gjabell	it bugs me bc I can't actually open messenger and read someone's message until I'm ready to respond, otherwise they'll think I'm ignoring them 
2018-03-16 17:18:56	jesse	right?! 
2018-03-16 17:19:27	gjabell	plus their emojis are the worst 
2018-03-16 17:19:33	gjabell	well, maybe not quite as bad as groupme 
2018-03-16 17:19:36	gjabell	but close 
2018-03-16 17:19:43	jesse	I miss the text emojis. 
2018-03-16 17:19:52	gjabell	exactly 
2018-03-16 17:20:03	gjabell	although I guess it's hard to make an eggplant with text emojies lol 
2018-03-16 17:20:23	jesse	?(?????)?    
2018-03-16 17:20:23		me at FB ^ 
2018-03-16 17:20:50	gjabell	lol xD 
2018-03-16 17:21:15	gjabell	have you heard of matrix? 
2018-03-16 17:21:21	jesse	nope 
2018-03-16 17:22:02	gjabell	https://matrix.org/ 
2018-03-16 17:22:03	jesse	when youre cool enough to have a big enough group of nerdy linux friends, we should make an irc channel :P 
2018-03-16 17:22:20	gjabell	this is kind of similar I think, it's basically decentralized chat 
2018-03-16 17:22:50	gjabell	I was actually going to set up an irc server once I finish reconfiguring stuff xD 
2018-03-16 17:23:00	gjabell	although I kind of want to try making a matrix server too 
2018-03-16 17:24:59	jesse	my browser seems to be struggling loading http://matrix.org (matrix.org) 
2018-03-16 17:25:11	gjabell	yeah mine too lol 
2018-03-16 17:25:16	gjabell	I wasn't sure if it was just me xD 
2018-03-16 17:25:29	jesse	Haha 
2018-03-16 17:25:46	gjabell	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_(communication_protocol)
2018-03-16 17:25:46		Wikipedia: Matrix (communication protocol)
2018-03-16 17:25:46		Matrix is an open protocol for real-time communication. It is designed to allow users with accounts at one communications service provider to communicate with users of a different service provider via online chat, Voice over IP, and Videotelephony. That is, it aims to make real-time communication work seamlessly between different service providers, just like standard Simple Mail Transfer Protocol email does now for store-and-forward email service.
2018-03-16 17:25:46		From a technical perspective, it is an application layer communications protocol for federated real-time communication. It provides HTTP APIs and open source reference implementations for securely distributing and persisting messages in JSON format over an open federation of servers. It can integrate with standard web services via WebRTC, facilitating browser-to-browser applications.
2018-03-16 17:25:46		Other attempts at defining an open instant messaging or multimedia signalling protocol of this type and getting it widely adopted (e.g. XMPP and IRCv3) have highlighted the challenges involved, both technological and political. It is unclear if there is enough demand among users for services which interoperate among providers. 
2018-03-16 17:26:54	gjabell	it's neat bc you can self host it (since it's decentralized), and it's end-to-end encrypted 
2018-03-16 17:27:07	gjabell	so in theory, you control the full access of the info 
2018-03-16 17:27:59	jesse	seems pretty sweet. but only nerds like us would use it haha 
2018-03-16 17:28:08	gjabell	yeah ik that's the issue xD 
2018-03-16 17:28:11	jesse	which may just be what we need. 
2018-03-16 17:28:14	gjabell	^ 
2018-03-16 17:28:15	jesse	who needs normies 
2018-03-16 17:28:33	gjabell	it does have a web client and native gui clients I think, so it might be of some interest to non techies lol 
2018-03-16 17:28:55	gjabell	it's similar to slack or irc in terms of how it operates I think, with rooms, etc. 
2018-03-16 17:29:43	jesse	I like that setup 
2018-03-16 17:29:58	gjabell	yeah I think it works fairly well 
2018-03-16 17:30:03	gjabell	esp with the right client 
2018-03-16 17:30:29	jesse	hold on 
2018-03-16 17:30:52	jesse	ahh I was testing if the terminal slack thing had multi-line support 
2018-03-16 17:31:00	gjabell	ah 
2018-03-16 17:31:02	gjabell	does it not? 
2018-03-16 17:31:06	gjabell	test 
2018-03-16 17:31:08	gjabell	nope 
2018-03-16 17:31:09	gjabell	rip 
2018-03-16 17:31:11	jesse	thats okay 
2018-03-16 17:31:17	gjabell	what about\n 
2018-03-16 17:31:19	gjabell	dran 
2018-03-16 17:31:29	jesse	reducing memory/cpu usage is my primary concern 
2018-03-16 17:31:35	gjabell	yeah 
2018-03-16 17:32:08	jesse	sadly internet browsers main goal is to use up every resource 
2018-03-16 17:32:15	gjabell	xD 
2018-03-16 17:32:25	gjabell	if (hasMoreRam) useMoreRam() 
2018-03-16 17:32:39	gjabell	or rather while(hasMoreRam) useMoreRam() 
2018-03-16 17:33:08	gjabell	I've been using firefox over chrome lately 
2018-03-16 17:33:19	gjabell	kinda getting tired of chrome, the android app is shit atm lol 
2018-03-16 17:33:29	gjabell	and I gotta say, firefox has some nice features 
2018-03-16 17:40:26	gjabell	have you tried ncmpcpp yet? :) 
2018-03-16 17:41:38	jesse	I've been using firefox too... Do you use firefox on mobile? and I've been trying to get ncmpcpp to work as I've been messaging you haha. I might be having a python3 vs python2 problem again. 
2018-03-16 17:42:03	gjabell	yeah I have been, the chrome app has been unusable lately for me, keeps freezing and shit 
2018-03-16 17:42:05	gjabell	xD nice 
2018-03-16 17:42:26	gjabell	I don't think it requires python 
2018-03-16 17:42:32	gjabell	or do you mean for the backend 
2018-03-16 17:44:34	jesse	I think I mean for the backend. gmusic doesn't seem to be working right. 
2018-03-16 17:44:47	gjabell	did you install mopidy? 
2018-03-16 17:45:08	jesse	although its possible I just didn't install the gmusic extension haha 
2018-03-16 17:45:16	gjabell	xD 
2018-03-16 17:45:19	gjabell	that'd do it lol 
2018-03-16 17:45:54	gjabell	looks like you need mopidy and mopidy-gmusic 
2018-03-16 17:46:14	gjabell	or mopidy-gmusic-git if you want to use AUR 
2018-03-16 17:46:40	gjabell	https://github.com/mopidy/mopidy-gmusic
2018-03-16 17:46:40		mopidy/mopidy-gmusic
2018-03-16 17:46:40		mopidy-gmusic - Mopidy extension for playing music from Google Play Music 
2018-03-16 17:46:54	gjabell	and then add your creds to the config file 
2018-03-16 17:50:42	jesse	python-mechanicalsoup seems to be causing yaourt to go in a loop 
2018-03-16 17:51:33	jesse	ill try the git version maybe 
2018-03-16 17:51:40	gjabell	hmm 
2018-03-16 17:51:41	gjabell	weird 
2018-03-16 18:06:25	jesse	its running now, but it cant seem to find any songs... but the server has some logs about 12 playlists.. 
2018-03-16 18:06:53	gjabell	did you just load up ncmpcpp? 
2018-03-16 18:08:24	jesse	yep 
2018-03-16 18:08:28	gjabell	try hitting 2 
2018-03-16 18:08:37	gjabell	which should show your playlists 
2018-03-16 18:08:44	gjabell	for me, it shows both local and spotify 
2018-03-16 18:09:00	jesse	Oh dang! that did it.  
2018-03-16 18:09:20	gjabell	and then if you hit enter on one of the playlists, it'll load it into your current playlist 
2018-03-16 18:09:27	gjabell	which shows up if you hit 1 
2018-03-16 18:10:11	jesse	although it seems to think that every song I own is from Staind haha 
2018-03-16 18:10:19	gjabell	lol xD 
2018-03-16 18:10:56	jesse	its probably cuz i don't know what im doing 
2018-03-16 18:11:14	gjabell	I think it should just be pulling the data from google play music 
2018-03-16 18:11:20	gjabell	could be that the plugin is glitched 
2018-03-16 18:11:56	jesse	WO I can fetch lyrics 
2018-03-16 18:12:10	gjabell	I can walk you through setting up the music visualizer if you want too, it's under 8 but you have to do some setup first 
2018-03-16 18:14:14	jesse	i just wanna know how to select music to play haha 
2018-03-16 18:14:21	gjabell	lol 
2018-03-16 18:14:34	gjabell	if you enter one of the playlists on the 2 page it should just start playing 
2018-03-16 18:14:35	jesse	I selected a song from Papa roach and suddenly Boston- more than a feeling came on 
2018-03-16 18:14:38	gjabell	that's what it does for me at least 
2018-03-16 18:14:40	gjabell	lol 
2018-03-16 18:14:57	gjabell	you can also edit playlists on 5 
2018-03-16 18:19:03	jesse	this is hilariously buggy 
2018-03-16 18:19:29	gjabell	damn xD idk why it's not working for you, everything works pretty well for me 
2018-03-16 18:20:57	jesse	I don't want to mess with this because I want to show you how great this is. to select songs from papa roach and get something vastly different 
2018-03-16 18:21:10	gjabell	xD 
2018-03-16 18:21:19	jesse	I hope Mozart returns Pink Floyd 
2018-03-16 18:21:25	gjabell	that'd be pretty great 
2018-03-16 18:23:03	jesse	Ok so if i hit Enter about 4 or 5 times it gets to the song I was looking for. 
2018-03-16 18:23:12	gjabell	problem solved! 
2018-03-16 18:23:16	jesse	now I just need enter to be a hotkey for itself 5 times 
2018-03-16 18:23:22	gjabell	lol 
2018-03-16 18:23:27	gjabell	rebind your enter key xD 
2018-03-16 18:23:55	jesse	Gosh I wonder whats happening to make it do this funky stuff. and also if this will run without running 'startx' 
2018-03-16 18:24:07	gjabell	yeah that's weird 
2018-03-16 18:24:13	gjabell	I would think it should be able to 
2018-03-16 18:24:49	jesse	It may be queuing songs or something 
2018-03-16 18:25:17	gjabell	it's certainly possible 
2018-03-16 18:25:30	gjabell	or maybe you just have like 20 copies of all your songs in your playlist 
2018-03-16 18:25:35	gjabell	xD 
2018-03-16 18:26:55	jesse	xD 
2018-03-16 18:28:32	jesse	Ok I know that isn't it.. I wonder if it has some sort of prioritization based on how many times I hit a song. 
2018-03-16 18:28:47	gjabell	hmm 
2018-03-16 18:28:50	gjabell	I don't think it does 
2018-03-16 18:29:04	gjabell	although idk if gplay organizes things differently than spotify 
2018-03-16 18:34:07	jesse	im gonna try a different version of ncmpcpp 
2018-03-16 18:34:16	jesse	maybe git will serve me better 
2018-03-16 18:34:16	gjabell	which one did you get 
2018-03-16 18:34:19	gjabell	ah 
2018-03-16 18:34:21	jesse	the one in yaourt 
2018-03-16 18:34:43	gjabell	the default one from pacman worked well for me 
2018-03-16 18:35:10	jesse	blasphemy 
2018-03-16 18:35:15	gjabell	xD 
2018-03-16 18:37:27	jesse	do you typically go for the -git packages in AUR or just the regular versions? 
2018-03-16 18:38:02	gjabell	depends, generally I'll go with the regulars but I will often check to see if one is out of date 
2018-03-16 18:50:12	jesse	well. I guess its kinda a fun bug. I'll show ya some time. It has some sort of pattern to it, but it isn't entirely obvious what's going on. 
2018-03-16 18:50:44	gjabell	xD that's really weird 
2018-03-16 22:38:39	jesse	Tested, the music player works without startx 
2018-03-20 10:04:56		getting channel history...
2018-03-16 17:30:52	jesse	ahh I was testing if the terminal slack thing had multi-line support 
2018-03-16 17:31:00	gjabell	ah 
2018-03-16 17:31:02	gjabell	does it not? 
2018-03-16 17:31:06	gjabell	test 
2018-03-16 17:31:08	gjabell	nope 
2018-03-16 17:31:09	gjabell	rip 
2018-03-16 17:31:11	jesse	thats okay 
2018-03-16 17:31:17	gjabell	what about\n 
2018-03-16 17:31:19	gjabell	dran 
2018-03-16 17:31:29	jesse	reducing memory/cpu usage is my primary concern 
2018-03-16 17:31:35	gjabell	yeah 
2018-03-16 17:32:08	jesse	sadly internet browsers main goal is to use up every resource 
2018-03-16 17:32:15	gjabell	xD 
2018-03-16 17:32:25	gjabell	if (hasMoreRam) useMoreRam() 
2018-03-16 17:32:39	gjabell	or rather while(hasMoreRam) useMoreRam() 
2018-03-16 17:33:08	gjabell	I've been using firefox over chrome lately 
2018-03-16 17:33:19	gjabell	kinda getting tired of chrome, the android app is shit atm lol 
2018-03-16 17:33:29	gjabell	and I gotta say, firefox has some nice features 
2018-03-16 17:40:26	gjabell	have you tried ncmpcpp yet? :) 
2018-03-16 17:41:38	jesse	I've been using firefox too... Do you use firefox on mobile? and I've been trying to get ncmpcpp to work as I've been messaging you haha. I might be having a python3 vs python2 problem again. 
2018-03-16 17:42:03	gjabell	yeah I have been, the chrome app has been unusable lately for me, keeps freezing and shit 
2018-03-16 17:42:05	gjabell	xD nice 
2018-03-16 17:42:26	gjabell	I don't think it requires python 
2018-03-16 17:42:32	gjabell	or do you mean for the backend 
2018-03-16 17:44:34	jesse	I think I mean for the backend. gmusic doesn't seem to be working right. 
2018-03-16 17:44:47	gjabell	did you install mopidy? 
2018-03-16 17:45:08	jesse	although its possible I just didn't install the gmusic extension haha 
2018-03-16 17:45:16	gjabell	xD 
2018-03-16 17:45:19	gjabell	that'd do it lol 
2018-03-16 17:45:54	gjabell	looks like you need mopidy and mopidy-gmusic 
2018-03-16 17:46:14	gjabell	or mopidy-gmusic-git if you want to use AUR

2018-03-17 13:46:31	gjabell	Nice 
2018-03-17 13:46:44	gjabell	You're using weechat on your laptop right? 
2018-03-17 14:21:56	jesse	yea 
2018-03-17 14:22:41	gjabell	I was going to ask if you were having any issues but I think I fixed it 
2018-03-17 14:22:55	gjabell	for some reason one of the plugins I was using was making everything freeze up lol 
2018-03-17 14:23:23	jesse	already using plugins... lol 
2018-03-17 14:23:33	gjabell	xD 
2018-03-17 14:23:54	gjabell	the go.py one is nice, it lets you type /go [query] and it'll match the channel based on the query 
2018-03-17 14:24:00	gjabell	so it's a bit easier than /buffer 
2018-03-17 14:41:28	jesse	that's pretty nice. although i think i might just prefer buffer for now since I have multiple channels. typing gjabell might get me you in plm or you in another channel. 
2018-03-17 14:42:52	gjabell	that's fair 
2018-03-17 14:43:00	gjabell	you can also do /go [number] 
2018-03-17 14:43:06	gjabell	which is a little faster than /buffer xD 
2018-03-17 14:43:09	gjabell	or hotke it 
2018-03-17 14:43:14	gjabell	hotkey* 
2018-03-17 15:59:40	jesse	yeah. I'm feeling kinda lazy so ill do that later lol.
2018-03-17 15:59:40		real quick though, its crazy how many things I can run in just terminal mode without having to worry about memory or performance. idk why people prefer the guis and notifications and junk.
2018-03-17 15:59:40		i guess the standard user who might only have chrome open wouldnt care... 
2018-03-17 16:00:12	gjabell	xD yeah 
2018-03-17 16:01:37	jesse	the past day i haven't even used startx :) 
2018-03-17 16:01:50	gjabell	lol nice 
2018-03-17 16:01:51	jesse	but ive been mostly python programming 
2018-03-17 16:02:12	gjabell	vim4life 
2018-03-17 16:03:28	jesse	vim+regex 4 life dude... regex accounts for a lot of the great text editor features I would typically rely on intellij or vs code for. 
2018-03-17 16:08:35	gjabell	I haven't done all that much with vim and regex yet 
2018-03-17 16:08:45	gjabell	Other that  searching and occasionally replace 
2018-03-17 16:08:54	gjabell	I need to get better at vim lol 
2018-03-17 16:45:29	jesse	search and replace is basically all you need.
2018-03-17 16:45:29		commenting is just searching for the beginning of  a line and replacing it with # . you can even indent groups of code by replacing the beginning with four spaces or take away indent by replacing '^    ' with empty string.... 
2018-03-17 16:47:37	gjabell	Huh
2018-03-17 16:47:37		That's pretty sweet actually 
2018-03-17 16:47:59	gjabell	I think you can also setup goto def and show uses but I haven't taken the time to do it yet 
2018-03-17 16:48:28	gjabell	I mostly just need to get more comfortable with memorizing the key commands 
2018-03-17 16:48:33	gjabell	For macros and stuff 
2018-03-17 16:48:50	jesse	also :26 would go to line 26. 
2018-03-17 16:49:33	gjabell	Yeah I know about that one 
2018-03-17 16:49:54	jesse	if you want to do search and replace on the whole file without highlighting everything, you can do 
2018-03-17 16:49:54		:%s/searchterm/replaceterm 
2018-03-17 16:50:07	jesse	thats everything I use. 
2018-03-17 16:52:47	gjabell	Partly having vim open new buffers for documentation / syntax checks / etc is just a bit clunkt for me 
2018-03-17 16:52:57	gjabell	Although maybe I could keybind them better idk 
2018-03-17 16:59:35	jesse	i dont use buffers in vim... seems too weird. 
2018-03-17 17:00:20	gjabell	It's nice with some plugins BC you can see documentation for methods or whatever inside of vim 
2018-03-17 17:01:17	jesse	that's neat. i worry about having issues opening files that are really big though. 
2018-03-17 17:02:11	gjabell	in terms of the documentation? 
2018-03-17 17:02:20	gjabell	bc it'll only show the documentation if you run a command 
2018-03-17 17:02:26	gjabell	while on the function name or whatever 
2018-03-17 17:02:32	gjabell	and it'll open a new buffer to show it 
2018-03-17 17:02:39	gjabell	so I don't think it actually makes it any slower 
2018-03-17 17:03:23	jesse	maybe not. im just trying to be light on plugins for now. 
2018-03-17 17:03:29	gjabell	that's fair 
2018-03-17 17:03:37	gjabell	I love plugins so I always go way overboard lol 
2018-03-17 17:04:22	jesse	plus if you ssh into another server and they dont have your plugins it kinda sucks. 
2018-03-17 17:04:31	gjabell	yeah true 
2018-03-17 17:04:43	gjabell	although there might be a way to tell ssh to use your own vim, I'm not sure about that 
2018-03-17 17:06:32	jesse	idk. btw I found a way to increase the font size of tty1 (no gui mode). if you feel like going true hacker without hurting your eyes a ton, youll need it. 
2018-03-17 17:06:54	gjabell	xD that's good 
2018-03-17 17:07:01	gjabell	is there a way to change color schemes? 
2018-03-17 17:07:48	jesse	dunno. there might be. im gonna play some video games instead of checking xD 
2018-03-17 17:07:56	gjabell	xD seems like a plan 
2018-03-17 17:10:05	gjabell	https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn/comments/55kjdb/tmux_tty_with_custom_theme/

2018-03-17 17:10:10	gjabell	survey says yes 
2018-03-17 17:11:42	jesse	no wayy!!! thats cool! but its gonna make me sad when I have to go back to windows for literally any job :( 
2018-03-17 17:11:53	gjabell	lol yeah xD 
2018-03-17 17:12:04	gjabell	some places will probably let you use linux if you want 
2018-03-17 17:12:13	gjabell	also you could always cygwin + stuff :) 
2018-03-17 17:12:24	gjabell	weechat is a supported package xD 
2018-03-17 17:12:29	jesse	its just not the same 
2018-03-17 17:12:51	jesse	we could just ssh into a raspberry pi or something 
2018-03-17 17:13:02	gjabell	lol yea 
2018-03-17 17:13:21	jesse	linux on raspberry pi > windows xD 
2018-03-17 17:13:26	gjabell	^ 
2018-03-17 17:13:33	gjabell	linux on anything > windows 
2018-03-17 17:13:37	gjabell	except for games lol 
2018-03-17 17:13:40	gjabell	most games taht is 
2018-03-17 17:13:50	jesse	TuxRacer 
2018-03-17 17:13:53	jesse	xD jk 
2018-03-17 17:13:56	gjabell	lol 
2018-03-18 17:58:36	gjabell	so I started doing some more with tmux today 
2018-03-18 17:58:40	gjabell	gotta say, it's pretty sweet 
2018-03-18 17:59:42	gjabell	unf there's a weird issue with mine where the background color doesn't get set correctly on vim or the status bar and I can't figure out why xD 
2018-03-18 17:59:48	gjabell	but other than that's it's quite nice 
2018-03-18 18:00:10	jesse	is the background a grayish color? 
2018-03-18 18:00:15	gjabell	yeah 
2018-03-18 18:00:23	jesse	lemme check something 
2018-03-18 18:00:36	gjabell	it's supposed to be a sort of dark blue 
2018-03-18 18:00:38	gjabell	like really dark 
2018-03-18 18:00:46	gjabell	but it ends up being a gray instead 
2018-03-18 18:01:05	gjabell	might be the terminal I'm using is confusing it, but I haven't had much success finding stuff about it online 
2018-03-18 18:03:21	jesse	you may need to put 
2018-03-18 18:03:21		export TERM=xterm-256color
2018-03-18 18:03:21		in your bashrc. 
2018-03-18 18:04:41	jesse	or go to whichever terminal you use and set it to that in its environment settings 
2018-03-18 18:04:56	gjabell	I don't think that's working for me, although it might be bc I'm using a different shell than bash 
2018-03-18 18:05:07	jesse	zsh? 
2018-03-18 18:05:11	gjabell	fish xD 
2018-03-18 18:05:20	jesse	lol wut 
2018-03-18 18:05:29	gjabell	there's something on the arch wiki under tmux about setting term for termite, which is what I'm doing, but it doesn't work either 
2018-03-18 18:05:34	gjabell	could also be an issue with my vim config 
2018-03-18 18:05:49	gjabell	it's pretty great, it's like zsh but with a lot of the things that you can plugin with zsh built in 
2018-03-18 18:05:57	gjabell	plus the scripting language is really nice 
2018-03-18 18:06:04	gjabell	and it has excellent highlighting 
2018-03-18 18:10:05	gjabell	well, and now it seems to be working lol 
2018-03-18 18:10:07	gjabell	fuck me 
2018-03-18 18:10:29	jesse	xD will you ever have a system thats "good enough"? 
2018-03-18 18:10:49	gjabell	I really hope not xD 
2018-03-18 18:10:55	jesse	i guess that defeats the purpose of technology 
2018-03-18 18:10:57	gjabell	bc if I ever do I'll probably get really board lol 
2018-03-18 18:11:14	jesse	hahaha true 
2018-03-18 18:11:29	jesse	id have no use for my computer 
2018-03-18 18:12:00	gjabell	pretty much yeah 
2018-03-20 10:21:39	jesse	Do you think a raspberry pi could host gitlab? 
2018-03-20 10:23:44	gjabell	hmm 
2018-03-20 10:23:44	gjabell	mayube 
2018-03-20 10:24:15	gjabell	apparently it wants 2cpu 4gb ram 
2018-03-20 10:24:18	gjabell	so maybe not 
2018-03-20 10:24:32	gjabell	although if it's just you it might work? but I've had issues with not having enough ram 
2018-03-20 10:24:35	gjabell	you could try gogs tho 
2018-03-20 10:24:40	gjabell	I think it's lighter weight 
2018-03-20 10:26:01	jesse	i might do that. id like to have all my dotfiles in a repo but not have to worry about passwords getting accidently pushed. 
2018-03-20 10:27:00	gjabell	yeah taht's a good idea 
2018-03-20 10:27:06	gjabell	that's what I've been doing, works like a charm 
2018-03-20 10:27:14	gjabell	plus you can make it public if you plug it in your room 
2018-03-20 10:27:30	jesse	hahaha true 
2018-03-20 10:27:50	jesse	thats so strange that that worked 
2018-03-20 10:28:42	gjabell	ikr 
2018-03-20 10:28:46	gjabell	it's weird but wonderful 
2018-03-20 10:28:59	gjabell	do you use a password manager? 
2018-03-20 10:29:13	jesse	yeah. I've been using LastPass. 
2018-03-20 10:29:19	gjabell	does it have a cli? 
2018-03-20 10:29:28	jesse	nope.. but it does have phone support 
2018-03-20 10:29:32	gjabell	ok 
2018-03-20 10:29:43	gjabell	if you ever get tired of a gui password manager, you should check out pass :) 
2018-03-20 10:30:00	gjabell	fully command line, encrypts passwords using a gpg key, and it integrates with git 
2018-03-20 10:30:02	gjabell	it's awesome 
2018-03-20 10:30:02	jesse	(you can use on phone... not you can call them and get some indian guy to help you when you forget your password...) 
2018-03-20 10:30:07	gjabell	lol xD 
2018-03-20 10:30:10	jesse	xD 
2018-03-20 10:31:05	jesse	I'll look into pass, but I'm pretty happy with lastpass. It's even got this neat feature that automatically changes your password on common sites. 
2018-03-20 10:31:14	jesse	not that I actually use that one 
2018-03-20 10:31:19	jesse	but its cool 
2018-03-20 10:31:32	gjabell	that's fair 
2018-03-20 10:31:34	gjabell	yeah that is nice 
2018-03-20 10:31:49	gjabell	I like pass bc I can use my yubikey to decrypt / encrypt stuff lol 
2018-03-20 10:31:57	gjabell	although I think lastpass integrates with it as well, so 
2018-03-20 10:33:25	jesse	whats a yubikey? 
2018-03-20 10:33:37	jesse	is that your special flashdrive? 
2018-03-20 10:34:34	gjabell	yeah 
2018-03-20 10:34:42	gjabell	it's a security key, you can use it for 2fa 
2018-03-20 10:34:47	gjabell	but it can also store gpg keys 
2018-03-20 10:35:03	gjabell	so I have my private key on it, which means I can only decrypt my passwords if I have the yubikey 
2018-03-20 10:35:21	gjabell	so even if someone stole my laptop or broke into my git, the pass directory would be useless unless they also had my key 
2018-03-20 10:41:38	jesse	I want whoever is trying to get into my stuff to have the most annoying process of trying to get in. I want them to have to use facial recognition from a real panda, use my pinky toes fingerprint, And get a high score on dance dance revolution before they can get into my computer. 
2018-03-20 10:42:15	gjabell	lol xD 
2018-03-20 10:42:22	jesse	And the gui would just be a gif of confetti with subtitles like "you did it" 
2018-03-20 10:42:27	gjabell	lol 
2018-03-20 10:42:34	gjabell	you should do that 
2018-03-20 10:42:35	jesse	or "sorry mario, but your princess is in another castle" 
2018-03-20 10:42:46	gjabell	make a honeypot with all that xD 
2018-03-20 10:43:21	jesse	If only people saw me as einstein and actually wanted into my stuff. 
2018-03-20 10:43:37	jesse	step 1: become einstein. 
2018-03-20 10:43:48	gjabell	I'm sure some random people in asia would be willing to take a crack 
2018-03-20 10:43:50	gjabell	or russia 
2018-03-20 10:44:13	gjabell	I had a server on digitalocean with fail2ban on it at one point, and I was getting 10-15 emails a day about people trying to break into it lol 
2018-03-20 10:44:37	jesse	what is fail2ban? 
2018-03-20 10:44:55	gjabell	it's a daemon that runs, watching the ssh logs for your server 
2018-03-20 10:45:18	gjabell	and if an ip fails to authenticate x number of times (which you can set), it adds a firewall rule to permanently block that ip from accessing anything 
2018-03-20 10:45:32	gjabell	so if people are trying to ssh into your server, it'll ban them if they can't authenticate 
2018-03-20 10:45:43	gjabell	basically just prevents brute force attacks 
2018-03-20 10:45:54	gjabell	which is kind of irrelevant if you are using ssh keys, but still 
2018-03-20 10:48:04	jesse	Hahaha my brother would have me banned then xD sometimes I'll change his wallpaper, or have recursively linked empty porn directories like in XKCD... But its okay, cuz he gave me permission.  
2018-03-20 10:50:09	gjabell	lol xD 
2018-03-20 10:50:17	gjabell	I accidentally banned myself once lol 
2018-03-20 10:50:32	jesse	What?! Thats awesome!! 
2018-03-20 10:53:05	gjabell	yeah, I was trying out a 2fa thing and it didn't work well, so when I went to ssh in again, it had blocked me xD 
2018-03-20 10:53:17	gjabell	I had to go to the digitalocean console and delete my ip from iptables lol 
2018-03-20 10:53:29	gjabell	I was really confused at first, before I realized what had happened 
2018-03-20 10:57:52	jesse	Sounds like that digitalocean console is a big security risk... 
2018-03-20 10:58:13	jesse	better patch that up galen.  
2018-03-20 10:58:19	gjabell	lol xD 
2018-03-20 10:58:22	gjabell	2fa ftw 
2018-03-20 14:23:33	gjabell	do you know what your team got on the plm project? 
2018-03-20 14:26:33	jesse	90. 
2018-03-20 14:26:37	jesse	you? 
2018-03-20 14:27:11	gjabell	80 
2018-03-20 14:27:28	gjabell	we went and talked with him about it bc we thought it was from us using gitlab even though we were given permission to use it 
2018-03-20 14:28:01	gjabell	but apparently it's because ours was 'just a project' and some teams 'deserved more points' 
2018-03-20 14:28:32	gjabell	which is fair, but since we gave him what the instructions asked for it seems a bit unfair to dock points from teams that didn't do as much as other teams rather than giving those teams extra points or something 
2018-03-20 14:28:33	gjabell	idk 
2018-03-20 14:28:50	jesse	ah i gotcha. we got points off cuz we didnt implement an FSM. even though the teacher just said to implement the card games "in any way that works" 
2018-03-20 14:29:09	gjabell	ok, so effectively the same reason we lost points 
2018-03-20 14:29:18	gjabell	that strikes me as a bit bs 
2018-03-20 14:30:49	jesse	I agree, but ya have to remember how little grades actually matter. No matter what we do, we will pass this class and graduate. Beyond that, if a company rejects me on the basis of gpa, I wouldn't want to work for them anyway. 
2018-03-20 14:30:59	gjabell	that's true 
2018-03-20 14:31:55	jesse	Besides, knowing us, we'll probably setup our own personal labs if we get bored working a standard programming job xD 
2018-03-20 14:32:21	gjabell	lol xD 
2018-03-20 14:32:24	gjabell	you know it 
2018-03-20 14:32:34	jesse	you've basically already got one. Your living room xD 
2018-03-20 14:32:49	gjabell	lol 
2018-03-20 14:32:57	gjabell	I actually just sold everything on sunday :P 
2018-03-20 14:33:39	jesse	you'll get bored eventually and buy it back... or something better... 
2018-03-20 14:33:55	jesse	your servers? 
2018-03-20 14:34:04	gjabell	yeah xD 
2018-03-20 14:34:13	gjabell	but I already bought of bunch of stuff for a white box build so we good lol 
2018-03-20 14:34:36	gjabell	I love the enterprise gear but moving it was going to be such a pain 
2018-03-20 14:34:43	jesse	haha whats it mean to be a whitebox build? you build it yourself? 
2018-03-20 14:34:50	gjabell	so I just put it up on craigslist on the offchance someone wanted it, and they did lol 
2018-03-20 14:35:00	gjabell	yeah, basically just custom built server in a normal computer case 
2018-03-20 14:37:20	jesse	my laptops host name is whitebox and my raspberry pi is blackbox... since I am a lot closer understanding to the software to my arch linux os than I am on the standard raspberry pi os. 
2018-03-20 14:37:29	gjabell	lol xD 
2018-03-20 14:37:31	gjabell	that's pretty great 
2018-03-20 14:38:38	jesse	I saw some servers on System76's webpage that were the size of a raspberry pi but a ton better. If you're looking for portability, you should check those out. 
2018-03-20 14:38:52	jesse	They are a lil expensive though 
2018-03-20 14:39:04	jesse	I think they call them 'Meerkats' or something 
2018-03-20 14:39:12	gjabell	huh 
2018-03-20 14:40:09	jesse	https://system76.com/desktops/meerkat 
2018-03-20 14:41:15	jesse	I think they advertise it more like a desktop, but I think it would act more functionally like a linux server...  
2018-03-20 14:41:19	gjabell	that's neat 
2018-03-20 14:57:50	gjabell	gogs is advertised as being able to run on a rasp pi btw, so if you end up going with a git host that seems like the way to go xD 
2018-03-20 14:59:13	jesse	thanks for letting me know!  it may be the first semiuseful use for my raspberry pi xD 
2018-03-20 15:00:45	gjabell	xD 
2018-03-20 15:00:54	gjabell	I haven't tried gogs yet but the interface looks pretty nice 
2018-03-20 15:02:20	jesse	something else I think would be useful, is if I got some nixie tubes (cuz theyre stylish), and hook it up in a way so that those tubes act as a physical progress bar  or timer for my super long scripts. 
2018-03-20 15:03:09	gjabell	that would be neat 
2018-03-20 15:03:12	gjabell	what are nixie tubes? 
2018-03-20 15:04:07	jesse	just google it. it was used before digital displays... kinda like neon signs but cool and orange 
2018-03-20 15:04:41	gjabell	that's fucking cool 
2018-03-20 15:04:45	gjabell	you should totally get some of those 
2018-03-20 15:04:48	jesse	right?!?! 
2018-03-20 15:05:22	gjabell	now I want some 
2018-03-20 15:05:29	gjabell	even though I have no idea what I'd use them for xD 
2018-03-20 15:05:47	jesse	xD even a clock would look super cool 
2018-03-20 15:06:01	gjabell	yeah 
2018-03-20 15:07:16	jesse	if im gonna do something like that, I should probably do it while im at state, cuz ill probably need a 3d printer 
2018-03-20 15:07:39	gjabell	hmm yeah 
2018-03-20 16:43:06		getting channel history...
2018-03-17 16:48:28	gjabell	I mostly just need to get more comfortable with memorizing the key commands 
2018-03-17 16:48:33	gjabell	For macros and stuff 
2018-03-17 16:48:50	jesse	also :26 would go to line 26. 
2018-03-17 16:49:33	gjabell	Yeah I know about that one 
2018-03-17 16:49:54	jesse	if you want to do search and replace on the whole file without highlighting everything, you can do 
2018-03-17 16:49:54		:%s/searchterm/replaceterm 
2018-03-17 16:50:07	jesse	thats everything I use. 
2018-03-17 16:52:47	gjabell	Partly having vim open new buffers for documentation / syntax checks / etc is just a bit clunkt for me 
2018-03-17 16:52:57	gjabell	Although maybe I could keybind them better idk 
2018-03-17 16:59:35	jesse	i dont use buffers in vim... seems too weird. 
2018-03-17 17:00:20	gjabell	It's nice with some plugins BC you can see documentation for methods or whatever inside of vim 
2018-03-17 17:01:17	jesse	that's neat. i worry about having issues opening files that are really big though. 
2018-03-17 17:02:11	gjabell	in terms of the documentation? 
2018-03-17 17:02:20	gjabell	bc it'll only show the documentation if you run a command 
2018-03-17 17:02:26	gjabell	while on the function name or whatever 
2018-03-17 17:02:32	gjabell	and it'll open a new buffer to show it 
2018-03-17 17:02:39	gjabell	so I don't think it actually makes it any slower 
2018-03-17 17:03:23	jesse	maybe not. im just trying to be light on plugins for now. 
2018-03-17 17:03:29	gjabell	that's fair 
2018-03-17 17:03:37	gjabell	I love plugins so I always go way overboard lol 
2018-03-17 17:04:22	jesse	plus if you ssh into another server and they dont have your plugins it kinda sucks. 
2018-03-17 17:04:31	gjabell	yeah true 
2018-03-17 17:04:43	gjabell	although there might be a way to tell ssh to use your own vim, I'm not sure about that 
2018-03-17 17:06:32	jesse	idk. btw I found a way to increase the font size of tty1 (no gui mode). if you feel like going true hacker without hurting your eyes a ton, youll need it. 
2018-03-17 17:06:54	gjabell	xD that's good 
2018-03-17 17:07:01	gjabell	is there a way to change color schemes? 
2018-03-17 17:07:48	jesse	dunno. there might be. im gonna play some video games instead of checking xD 
2018-03-17 17:07:56	gjabell	xD seems like a plan 
2018-03-17 17:10:05	gjabell	https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn/comments/55kjdb/tmux_tty_with_custom_theme/
2018-03-17 17:10:05		[tmux] TTY with custom theme ? r/unixporn
2018-03-17 17:10:05		80 points and 19 comments so far on reddit 
2018-03-17 17:10:10	gjabell	survey says yes 
2018-03-17 17:11:42	jesse	no wayy!!! thats cool! but its gonna make me sad when I have to go back to windows for literally any job :( 
2018-03-17 17:11:53	gjabell	lol yeah xD 
2018-03-17 17:12:04	gjabell	some places will probably let you use linux if you want 
2018-03-17 17:12:13	gjabell	also you could always cygwin + stuff :) 
2018-03-17 17:12:24	gjabell	weechat is a supported package xD 
2018-03-17 17:12:29	jesse	its just not the same 
2018-03-17 17:12:51	jesse	we could just ssh into a raspberry pi or something 
2018-03-17 17:13:02	gjabell	lol yea 
2018-03-17 17:13:21	jesse	linux on raspberry pi > windows xD 
2018-03-17 17:13:26	gjabell	^ 
2018-03-17 17:13:33	gjabell	linux on anything > windows 
2018-03-17 17:13:37	gjabell	except for games lol 
2018-03-17 17:13:40	gjabell	most games taht is 
2018-03-17 17:13:50	jesse	TuxRacer 
2018-03-17 17:13:53	jesse	xD jk 
2018-03-17 17:13:56	gjabell	lol 
2018-03-18 17:58:36	gjabell	so I started doing some more with tmux today 
2018-03-18 17:58:40	gjabell	gotta say, it's pretty sweet 
2018-03-18 17:59:42	gjabell	unf there's a weird issue with mine where the background color doesn't get set correctly on vim or the status bar and I can't figure out why xD 
2018-03-18 17:59:48	gjabell	but other than that's it's quite nice 
2018-03-18 18:00:10	jesse	is the background a grayish color? 
2018-03-18 18:00:15	gjabell	yeah 
2018-03-18 18:00:23	jesse	lemme check something 
2018-03-18 18:00:36	gjabell	it's supposed to be a sort of dark blue 
2018-03-18 18:00:38	gjabell	like really dark 
2018-03-18 18:00:46	gjabell	but it ends up being a gray instead 
2018-03-18 18:01:05	gjabell	might be the terminal I'm using is confusing it, but I haven't had much success finding stuff about it online 
2018-03-18 18:03:21	jesse	you may need to put 
2018-03-18 18:03:21		export TERM=xterm-256color
2018-03-18 18:03:21		in your bashrc. 
2018-03-18 18:04:41	jesse	or go to whichever terminal you use and set it to that in its environment settings 
2018-03-18 18:04:56	gjabell	I don't think that's working for me, although it might be bc I'm using a different shell than bash 
2018-03-18 18:05:07	jesse	zsh? 
2018-03-18 18:05:11	gjabell	fish xD 
2018-03-18 18:05:20	jesse	lol wut 
2018-03-18 18:05:29	gjabell	there's something on the arch wiki under tmux about setting term for termite, which is what I'm doing, but it doesn't work either 
2018-03-18 18:05:34	gjabell	could also be an issue with my vim config 
2018-03-18 18:05:49	gjabell	it's pretty great, it's like zsh but with a lot of the things that you can plugin with zsh built in 
2018-03-18 18:05:57	gjabell	plus the scripting language is really nice 
2018-03-18 18:06:04	gjabell	and it has excellent highlighting 
2018-03-18 18:10:05	gjabell	well, and now it seems to be working lol 
2018-03-18 18:10:07	gjabell	fuck me 
2018-03-18 18:10:29	jesse	xD will you ever have a system thats "good enough"? 
2018-03-18 18:10:49	gjabell	I really hope not xD 
2018-03-18 18:10:55	jesse	i guess that defeats the purpose of technology 
2018-03-18 18:10:57	gjabell	bc if I ever do I'll probably get really board lol 
2018-03-18 18:11:14	jesse	hahaha true 
2018-03-18 18:11:29	jesse	id have no use for my computer 
2018-03-18 18:12:00	gjabell	pretty much yeah 
2018-03-20 10:21:39	jesse	Do you think a raspberry pi could host gitlab? 
2018-03-20 10:23:44	gjabell	hmm 
2018-03-20 10:23:44	gjabell	mayube 
2018-03-20 10:24:15	gjabell	apparently it wants 2cpu 4gb ram 
2018-03-20 10:24:18	gjabell	so maybe not 
2018-03-20 10:24:32	gjabell	although if it's just you it might work? but I've had issues with not having enough ram 
2018-03-20 10:24:35	gjabell	you could try gogs tho 
2018-03-20 10:24:40	gjabell	I think it's lighter weight 
2018-03-20 10:26:01	jesse	i might do that. id like to have all my dotfiles in a repo but not have to worry about passwords getting accidently pushed. 
2018-03-20 10:27:00	gjabell	yeah taht's a good idea 
2018-03-20 10:27:06	gjabell	that's what I've been doing, works like a charm 
2018-03-20 10:27:14	gjabell	plus you can make it public if you plug it in your room 
2018-03-20 10:27:30	jesse	hahaha true 
2018-03-20 10:27:50	jesse	thats so strange that that worked 
2018-03-20 10:28:42	gjabell	ikr 
2018-03-20 10:28:46	gjabell	it's weird but wonderful 
2018-03-20 10:28:59	gjabell	do you use a password manager? 
2018-03-20 10:29:13	jesse	yeah. I've been using LastPass. 
2018-03-20 10:29:19	gjabell	does it have a cli? 
2018-03-20 10:29:28	jesse	nope.. but it does have phone support 
2018-03-20 10:29:32	gjabell	ok 
2018-03-20 10:29:43	gjabell	if you ever get tired of a gui password manager, you should check out pass :) 
2018-03-20 10:30:00	gjabell	fully command line, encrypts passwords using a gpg key, and it integrates with git 
2018-03-20 10:30:02	gjabell	it's awesome 
2018-03-20 10:30:02	jesse	(you can use on phone... not you can call them and get some indian guy to help you when you forget your password...) 
2018-03-20 10:30:07	gjabell	lol xD 
2018-03-20 10:30:10	jesse	xD 
2018-03-20 10:31:05	jesse	I'll look into pass, but I'm pretty happy with lastpass. It's even got this neat feature that automatically changes your password on common sites. 
2018-03-20 10:31:14	jesse	not that I actually use that one 
2018-03-20 10:31:19	jesse	but its cool 
2018-03-20 10:31:32	gjabell	that's fair 
2018-03-20 10:31:34	gjabell	yeah that is nice 
2018-03-20 10:31:49	gjabell	I like pass bc I can use my yubikey to decrypt / encrypt stuff lol 
2018-03-20 10:31:57	gjabell	although I think lastpass integrates with it as well, so 
2018-03-20 10:33:25	jesse	whats a yubikey? 
2018-03-20 10:33:37	jesse	is that your special flashdrive? 
2018-03-20 10:34:34	gjabell	yeah 
2018-03-20 10:34:42	gjabell	it's a security key, you can use it for 2fa 
2018-03-20 10:34:47	gjabell	but it can also store gpg keys 
2018-03-20 10:35:03	gjabell	so I have my private key on it, which means I can only decrypt my passwords if I have the yubikey 
2018-03-20 10:35:21	gjabell	so even if someone stole my laptop or broke into my git, the pass directory would be useless unless they also had my key 
2018-03-20 10:41:38	jesse	I want whoever is trying to get into my stuff to have the most annoying process of trying to get in. I want them to have to use facial recognition from a real panda, use my pinky toes fingerprint, And get a high score on dance dance revolution before they can get into my computer. 
2018-03-20 10:42:15	gjabell	lol xD 
2018-03-20 10:42:22	jesse	And the gui would just be a gif of confetti with subtitles like "you did it" 
2018-03-20 10:42:27	gjabell	lol 
2018-03-20 10:42:34	gjabell	you should do that 
2018-03-20 10:42:35	jesse	or "sorry mario, but your princess is in another castle" 
2018-03-20 10:42:46	gjabell	make a honeypot with all that xD 
2018-03-20 10:43:21	jesse	If only people saw me as einstein and actually wanted into my stuff. 
2018-03-20 10:43:37	jesse	step 1: become einstein. 
2018-03-20 10:43:48	gjabell	I'm sure some random people in asia would be willing to take a crack 
2018-03-20 10:43:50	gjabell	or russia 
2018-03-20 10:44:13	gjabell	I had a server on digitalocean with fail2ban on it at one point, and I was getting 10-15 emails a day about people trying to break into it lol 
2018-03-20 10:44:37	jesse	what is fail2ban? 
2018-03-20 10:44:55	gjabell	it's a daemon that runs, watching the ssh logs for your server 
2018-03-20 10:45:18	gjabell	and if an ip fails to authenticate x number of times (which you can set), it adds a firewall rule to permanently block that ip from accessing anything 
2018-03-20 10:45:32	gjabell	so if people are trying to ssh into your server, it'll ban them if they can't authenticate 
2018-03-20 10:45:43	gjabell	basically just prevents brute force attacks 
2018-03-20 10:45:54	gjabell	which is kind of irrelevant if you are using ssh keys, but still 
2018-03-20 10:48:04	jesse	Hahaha my brother would have me banned then xD sometimes I'll change his wallpaper, or have recursively linked empty porn directories like in XKCD... But its okay, cuz he gave me permission.  
2018-03-20 10:50:09	gjabell	lol xD 
2018-03-20 10:50:17	gjabell	I accidentally banned myself once lol 
2018-03-20 10:50:32	jesse	What?! Thats awesome!! 
2018-03-20 10:53:05	gjabell	yeah, I was trying out a 2fa thing and it didn't work well, so when I went to ssh in again, it had blocked me xD 
2018-03-20 10:53:17	gjabell	I had to go to the digitalocean console and delete my ip from iptables lol 
2018-03-20 10:53:29	gjabell	I was really confused at first, before I realized what had happened 
2018-03-20 10:57:52	jesse	Sounds like that digitalocean console is a big security risk... 
2018-03-20 10:58:13	jesse	better patch that up galen.  
2018-03-20 10:58:19	gjabell	lol xD 
2018-03-20 10:58:22	gjabell	2fa ftw 
2018-03-20 14:23:33	gjabell	do you know what your team got on the plm project? 
2018-03-20 14:26:33	jesse	90. 
2018-03-20 14:26:37	jesse	you? 
2018-03-20 14:27:11	gjabell	80 
2018-03-20 14:27:28	gjabell	we went and talked with him about it bc we thought it was from us using gitlab even though we were given permission to use it 
2018-03-20 14:28:01	gjabell	but apparently it's because ours was 'just a project' and some teams 'deserved more points' 
2018-03-20 14:28:32	gjabell	which is fair, but since we gave him what the instructions asked for it seems a bit unfair to dock points from teams that didn't do as much as other teams rather than giving those teams extra points or something 
2018-03-20 14:28:33	gjabell	idk 
2018-03-20 14:28:50	jesse	ah i gotcha. we got points off cuz we didnt implement an FSM. even though the teacher just said to implement the card games "in any way that works" 
2018-03-20 14:29:09	gjabell	ok, so effectively the same reason we lost points 
2018-03-20 14:29:18	gjabell	that strikes me as a bit bs 
2018-03-20 14:30:49	jesse	I agree, but ya have to remember how little grades actually matter. No matter what we do, we will pass this class and graduate. Beyond that, if a company rejects me on the basis of gpa, I wouldn't want to work for them anyway. 
2018-03-20 14:30:59	gjabell	that's true 
2018-03-20 14:31:55	jesse	Besides, knowing us, we'll probably setup our own personal labs if we get bored working a standard programming job xD 
2018-03-20 14:32:21	gjabell	lol xD 
2018-03-20 14:32:24	gjabell	you know it 
2018-03-20 14:32:34	jesse	you've basically already got one. Your living room xD 
2018-03-20 14:32:49	gjabell	lol 
2018-03-20 14:32:57	gjabell	I actually just sold everything on sunday :P 
2018-03-20 14:33:39	jesse	you'll get bored eventually and buy it back... or something better... 
2018-03-20 14:33:55	jesse	your servers? 
2018-03-20 14:34:04	gjabell	yeah xD 
2018-03-20 14:34:13	gjabell	but I already bought of bunch of stuff for a white box build so we good lol 
2018-03-20 14:34:36	gjabell	I love the enterprise gear but moving it was going to be such a pain 
2018-03-20 14:34:43	jesse	haha whats it mean to be a whitebox build? you build it yourself? 
2018-03-20 14:34:50	gjabell	so I just put it up on craigslist on the offchance someone wanted it, and they did lol 
2018-03-20 14:35:00	gjabell	yeah, basically just custom built server in a normal computer case 
2018-03-20 14:37:20	jesse	my laptops host name is whitebox and my raspberry pi is blackbox... since I am a lot closer understanding to the software to my arch linux os than I am on the standard raspberry pi os. 
2018-03-20 14:37:29	gjabell	lol xD 
2018-03-20 14:37:31	gjabell	that's pretty great 
2018-03-20 14:38:38	jesse	I saw some servers on System76's webpage that were the size of a raspberry pi but a ton better. If you're looking for portability, you should check those out. 
2018-03-20 14:38:52	jesse	They are a lil expensive though 
2018-03-20 14:39:04	jesse	I think they call them 'Meerkats' or something 
2018-03-20 14:39:12	gjabell	huh 
2018-03-20 14:40:09	jesse	https://system76.com/desktops/meerkat
2018-03-20 14:40:09		Meerkat
2018-03-20 14:40:09		Adorns your desk without consuming it. Small but fierce, Meerkat is the perfect combination of performance and efficiency. System76 desktop computers are custom-built to run Ubuntu flawlessly. 
2018-03-20 14:41:15	jesse	I think they advertise it more like a desktop, but I think it would act more functionally like a linux server...  
2018-03-20 14:41:19	gjabell	that's neat 
2018-03-20 14:57:50	gjabell	gogs is advertised as being able to run on a rasp pi btw, so if you end up going with a git host that seems like the way to go xD 
2018-03-20 14:59:13	jesse	thanks for letting me know!  it may be the first semiuseful use for my raspberry pi xD 
2018-03-20 15:00:45	gjabell	xD 
2018-03-20 15:00:54	gjabell	I haven't tried gogs yet but the interface looks pretty nice 
2018-03-20 15:02:20	jesse	something else I think would be useful, is if I got some nixie tubes (cuz theyre stylish), and hook it up in a way so that those tubes act as a physical progress bar  or timer for my super long scripts. 
2018-03-20 15:03:09	gjabell	that would be neat 
2018-03-20 15:03:12	gjabell	what are nixie tubes? 
2018-03-20 15:04:07	jesse	just google it. it was used before digital displays... kinda like neon signs but cool and orange 
2018-03-20 15:04:41	gjabell	that's fucking cool 
2018-03-20 15:04:45	gjabell	you should totally get some of those 
2018-03-20 15:04:48	jesse	right?!?! 
2018-03-20 15:05:22	gjabell	now I want some 
2018-03-20 15:05:29	gjabell	even though I have no idea what I'd use them for xD 
2018-03-20 15:05:47	jesse	xD even a clock would look super cool 
2018-03-20 15:06:01	gjabell	yeah 
2018-03-20 15:07:16	jesse	if im gonna do something like that, I should probably do it while im at state, cuz ill probably need a 3d printer 
2018-03-20 15:07:39	gjabell	hmm yeah 
2018-03-20 16:43:40	jesse	prof seems overly excited about projects that averaged at 80% xD 
2018-03-20 16:44:00	gjabell	lol yea xD 
2018-03-20 20:42:29		getting channel history...
2018-03-17 16:48:50	jesse	also :26 would go to line 26. 
2018-03-17 16:49:33	gjabell	Yeah I know about that one 
2018-03-17 16:49:54	jesse	if you want to do search and replace on the whole file without highlighting everything, you can do 
2018-03-17 16:49:54		:%s/searchterm/replaceterm 
2018-03-17 16:50:07	jesse	thats everything I use. 
2018-03-17 16:52:47	gjabell	Partly having vim open new buffers for documentation / syntax checks / etc is just a bit clunkt for me 
2018-03-17 16:52:57	gjabell	Although maybe I could keybind them better idk 
2018-03-17 16:59:35	jesse	i dont use buffers in vim... seems too weird. 
2018-03-17 17:00:20	gjabell	It's nice with some plugins BC you can see documentation for methods or whatever inside of vim 
2018-03-17 17:01:17	jesse	that's neat. i worry about having issues opening files that are really big though. 
2018-03-17 17:02:11	gjabell	in terms of the documentation? 
2018-03-17 17:02:20	gjabell	bc it'll only show the documentation if you run a command 
2018-03-17 17:02:26	gjabell	while on the function name or whatever 
2018-03-17 17:02:32	gjabell	and it'll open a new buffer to show it 
2018-03-17 17:02:39	gjabell	so I don't think it actually makes it any slower 
2018-03-17 17:03:23	jesse	maybe not. im just trying to be light on plugins for now. 
2018-03-17 17:03:29	gjabell	that's fair 
2018-03-17 17:03:37	gjabell	I love plugins so I always go way overboard lol 
2018-03-17 17:04:22	jesse	plus if you ssh into another server and they dont have your plugins it kinda sucks. 
2018-03-17 17:04:31	gjabell	yeah true 
2018-03-17 17:04:43	gjabell	although there might be a way to tell ssh to use your own vim, I'm not sure about that 
2018-03-17 17:06:32	jesse	idk. btw I found a way to increase the font size of tty1 (no gui mode). if you feel like going true hacker without hurting your eyes a ton, youll need it. 
2018-03-17 17:06:54	gjabell	xD that's good 
2018-03-17 17:07:01	gjabell	is there a way to change color schemes? 
2018-03-17 17:07:48	jesse	dunno. there might be. im gonna play some video games instead of checking xD 
2018-03-17 17:07:56	gjabell	xD seems like a plan 
2018-03-17 17:10:05	gjabell	https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn/comments/55kjdb/tmux_tty_with_custom_theme/

2018-03-17 17:10:10	gjabell	survey says yes 
2018-03-17 17:11:42	jesse	no wayy!!! thats cool! but its gonna make me sad when I have to go back to windows for literally any job :( 
2018-03-17 17:11:53	gjabell	lol yeah xD 
2018-03-17 17:12:04	gjabell	some places will probably let you use linux if you want 
2018-03-17 17:12:13	gjabell	also you could always cygwin + stuff :) 
2018-03-17 17:12:24	gjabell	weechat is a supported package xD 
2018-03-17 17:12:29	jesse	its just not the same 
2018-03-17 17:12:51	jesse	we could just ssh into a raspberry pi or something 
2018-03-17 17:13:02	gjabell	lol yea 
2018-03-17 17:13:21	jesse	linux on raspberry pi > windows xD 
2018-03-17 17:13:26	gjabell	^ 
2018-03-17 17:13:33	gjabell	linux on anything > windows 
2018-03-17 17:13:37	gjabell	except for games lol 
2018-03-17 17:13:40	gjabell	most games taht is 
2018-03-17 17:13:50	jesse	TuxRacer 
2018-03-17 17:13:53	jesse	xD jk 
2018-03-17 17:13:56	gjabell	lol 
2018-03-18 17:58:36	gjabell	so I started doing some more with tmux today 
2018-03-18 17:58:40	gjabell	gotta say, it's pretty sweet 
2018-03-18 17:59:42	gjabell	unf there's a weird issue with mine where the background color doesn't get set correctly on vim or the status bar and I can't figure out why xD 
2018-03-18 17:59:48	gjabell	but other than that's it's quite nice 
2018-03-18 18:00:10	jesse	is the background a grayish color? 
2018-03-18 18:00:15	gjabell	yeah 
2018-03-18 18:00:23	jesse	lemme check something 
2018-03-18 18:00:36	gjabell	it's supposed to be a sort of dark blue 
2018-03-18 18:00:38	gjabell	like really dark 
2018-03-18 18:00:46	gjabell	but it ends up being a gray instead 
2018-03-18 18:01:05	gjabell	might be the terminal I'm using is confusing it, but I haven't had much success finding stuff about it online 
2018-03-18 18:03:21	jesse	you may need to put 
2018-03-18 18:03:21		export TERM=xterm-256color
2018-03-18 18:03:21		in your bashrc. 
2018-03-18 18:04:41	jesse	or go to whichever terminal you use and set it to that in its environment settings 
2018-03-18 18:04:56	gjabell	I don't think that's working for me, although it might be bc I'm using a different shell than bash 
2018-03-18 18:05:07	jesse	zsh? 
2018-03-18 18:05:11	gjabell	fish xD 
2018-03-18 18:05:20	jesse	lol wut 
2018-03-18 18:05:29	gjabell	there's something on the arch wiki under tmux about setting term for termite, which is what I'm doing, but it doesn't work either 
2018-03-18 18:05:34	gjabell	could also be an issue with my vim config 
2018-03-18 18:05:49	gjabell	it's pretty great, it's like zsh but with a lot of the things that you can plugin with zsh built in 
2018-03-18 18:05:57	gjabell	plus the scripting language is really nice 
2018-03-18 18:06:04	gjabell	and it has excellent highlighting 
2018-03-18 18:10:05	gjabell	well, and now it seems to be working lol 
2018-03-18 18:10:07	gjabell	fuck me 
2018-03-18 18:10:29	jesse	xD will you ever have a system thats "good enough"? 
2018-03-18 18:10:49	gjabell	I really hope not xD 
2018-03-18 18:10:55	jesse	i guess that defeats the purpose of technology 
2018-03-18 18:10:57	gjabell	bc if I ever do I'll probably get really board lol 
2018-03-18 18:11:14	jesse	hahaha true 
2018-03-18 18:11:29	jesse	id have no use for my computer 
2018-03-18 18:12:00	gjabell	pretty much yeah 
2018-03-20 10:21:39	jesse	Do you think a raspberry pi could host gitlab? 
2018-03-20 10:23:44	gjabell	hmm 
2018-03-20 10:23:44	gjabell	mayube 
2018-03-20 10:24:15	gjabell	apparently it wants 2cpu 4gb ram 
2018-03-20 10:24:18	gjabell	so maybe not 
2018-03-20 10:24:32	gjabell	although if it's just you it might work? but I've had issues with not having enough ram 
2018-03-20 10:24:35	gjabell	you could try gogs tho 
2018-03-20 10:24:40	gjabell	I think it's lighter weight 
2018-03-20 10:26:01	jesse	i might do that. id like to have all my dotfiles in a repo but not have to worry about passwords getting accidently pushed. 
2018-03-20 10:27:00	gjabell	yeah taht's a good idea 
2018-03-20 10:27:06	gjabell	that's what I've been doing, works like a charm 
2018-03-20 10:27:14	gjabell	plus you can make it public if you plug it in your room 
2018-03-20 10:27:30	jesse	hahaha true 
2018-03-20 10:27:50	jesse	thats so strange that that worked 
2018-03-20 10:28:42	gjabell	ikr 
2018-03-20 10:28:46	gjabell	it's weird but wonderful 
2018-03-20 10:28:59	gjabell	do you use a password manager? 
2018-03-20 10:29:13	jesse	yeah. I've been using LastPass. 
2018-03-20 10:29:19	gjabell	does it have a cli? 
2018-03-20 10:29:28	jesse	nope.. but it does have phone support 
2018-03-20 10:29:32	gjabell	ok 
2018-03-20 10:29:43	gjabell	if you ever get tired of a gui password manager, you should check out pass :) 
2018-03-20 10:30:00	gjabell	fully command line, encrypts passwords using a gpg key, and it integrates with git 
2018-03-20 10:30:02	gjabell	it's awesome 
2018-03-20 10:30:02	jesse	(you can use on phone... not you can call them and get some indian guy to help you when you forget your password...) 
2018-03-20 10:30:07	gjabell	lol xD 
2018-03-20 10:30:10	jesse	xD 
2018-03-20 10:31:05	jesse	I'll look into pass, but I'm pretty happy with lastpass. It's even got this neat feature that automatically changes your password on common sites. 
2018-03-20 10:31:14	jesse	not that I actually use that one 
2018-03-20 10:31:19	jesse	but its cool 
2018-03-20 10:31:32	gjabell	that's fair 
2018-03-20 10:31:34	gjabell	yeah that is nice 
2018-03-20 10:31:49	gjabell	I like pass bc I can use my yubikey to decrypt / encrypt stuff lol 
2018-03-20 10:31:57	gjabell	although I think lastpass integrates with it as well, so 
2018-03-20 10:33:25	jesse	whats a yubikey? 
2018-03-20 10:33:37	jesse	is that your special flashdrive? 
2018-03-20 10:34:34	gjabell	yeah 
2018-03-20 10:34:42	gjabell	it's a security key, you can use it for 2fa 
2018-03-20 10:34:47	gjabell	but it can also store gpg keys 
2018-03-20 10:35:03	gjabell	so I have my private key on it, which means I can only decrypt my passwords if I have the yubikey 
2018-03-20 10:35:21	gjabell	so even if someone stole my laptop or broke into my git, the pass directory would be useless unless they also had my key 
2018-03-20 10:41:38	jesse	I want whoever is trying to get into my stuff to have the most annoying process of trying to get in. I want them to have to use facial recognition from a real panda, use my pinky toes fingerprint, And get a high score on dance dance revolution before they can get into my computer. 
2018-03-20 10:42:15	gjabell	lol xD 
2018-03-20 10:42:22	jesse	And the gui would just be a gif of confetti with subtitles like "you did it" 
2018-03-20 10:42:27	gjabell	lol 
2018-03-20 10:42:34	gjabell	you should do that 
2018-03-20 10:42:35	jesse	or "sorry mario, but your princess is in another castle" 
2018-03-20 10:42:46	gjabell	make a honeypot with all that xD 
2018-03-20 10:43:21	jesse	If only people saw me as einstein and actually wanted into my stuff. 
2018-03-20 10:43:37	jesse	step 1: become einstein. 
2018-03-20 10:43:48	gjabell	I'm sure some random people in asia would be willing to take a crack 
2018-03-20 10:43:50	gjabell	or russia 
2018-03-20 10:44:13	gjabell	I had a server on digitalocean with fail2ban on it at one point, and I was getting 10-15 emails a day about people trying to break into it lol 
2018-03-20 10:44:37	jesse	what is fail2ban? 
2018-03-20 10:44:55	gjabell	it's a daemon that runs, watching the ssh logs for your server 
2018-03-20 10:45:18	gjabell	and if an ip fails to authenticate x number of times (which you can set), it adds a firewall rule to permanently block that ip from accessing anything 
2018-03-20 10:45:32	gjabell	so if people are trying to ssh into your server, it'll ban them if they can't authenticate 
2018-03-20 10:45:43	gjabell	basically just prevents brute force attacks 
2018-03-20 10:45:54	gjabell	which is kind of irrelevant if you are using ssh keys, but still 
2018-03-20 10:48:04	jesse	Hahaha my brother would have me banned then xD sometimes I'll change his wallpaper, or have recursively linked empty porn directories like in XKCD... But its okay, cuz he gave me permission.  
2018-03-20 10:50:09	gjabell	lol xD 
2018-03-20 10:50:17	gjabell	I accidentally banned myself once lol 
2018-03-20 10:50:32	jesse	What?! Thats awesome!! 
2018-03-20 10:53:05	gjabell	yeah, I was trying out a 2fa thing and it didn't work well, so when I went to ssh in again, it had blocked me xD 
2018-03-20 10:53:17	gjabell	I had to go to the digitalocean console and delete my ip from iptables lol 
2018-03-20 10:53:29	gjabell	I was really confused at first, before I realized what had happened 
2018-03-20 10:57:52	jesse	Sounds like that digitalocean console is a big security risk... 
2018-03-20 10:58:13	jesse	better patch that up galen.  
2018-03-20 10:58:19	gjabell	lol xD 
2018-03-20 10:58:22	gjabell	2fa ftw 
2018-03-20 14:23:33	gjabell	do you know what your team got on the plm project? 
2018-03-20 14:26:33	jesse	90. 
2018-03-20 14:26:37	jesse	you? 
2018-03-20 14:27:11	gjabell	80 
2018-03-20 14:27:28	gjabell	we went and talked with him about it bc we thought it was from us using gitlab even though we were given permission to use it 
2018-03-20 14:28:01	gjabell	but apparently it's because ours was 'just a project' and some teams 'deserved more points' 
2018-03-20 14:28:32	gjabell	which is fair, but since we gave him what the instructions asked for it seems a bit unfair to dock points from teams that didn't do as much as other teams rather than giving those teams extra points or something 
2018-03-20 14:28:33	gjabell	idk 
2018-03-20 14:28:50	jesse	ah i gotcha. we got points off cuz we didnt implement an FSM. even though the teacher just said to implement the card games "in any way that works" 
2018-03-20 14:29:09	gjabell	ok, so effectively the same reason we lost points 
2018-03-20 14:29:18	gjabell	that strikes me as a bit bs 
2018-03-20 14:30:49	jesse	I agree, but ya have to remember how little grades actually matter. No matter what we do, we will pass this class and graduate. Beyond that, if a company rejects me on the basis of gpa, I wouldn't want to work for them anyway. 
2018-03-20 14:30:59	gjabell	that's true 
2018-03-20 14:31:55	jesse	Besides, knowing us, we'll probably setup our own personal labs if we get bored working a standard programming job xD 
2018-03-20 14:32:21	gjabell	lol xD 
2018-03-20 14:32:24	gjabell	you know it 
2018-03-20 14:32:34	jesse	you've basically already got one. Your living room xD 
2018-03-20 14:32:49	gjabell	lol 
2018-03-20 14:32:57	gjabell	I actually just sold everything on sunday :P 
2018-03-20 14:33:39	jesse	you'll get bored eventually and buy it back... or something better... 
2018-03-20 14:33:55	jesse	your servers? 
2018-03-20 14:34:04	gjabell	yeah xD 
2018-03-20 14:34:13	gjabell	but I already bought of bunch of stuff for a white box build so we good lol 
2018-03-20 14:34:36	gjabell	I love the enterprise gear but moving it was going to be such a pain 
2018-03-20 14:34:43	jesse	haha whats it mean to be a whitebox build? you build it yourself? 
2018-03-20 14:34:50	gjabell	so I just put it up on craigslist on the offchance someone wanted it, and they did lol 
2018-03-20 14:35:00	gjabell	yeah, basically just custom built server in a normal computer case 
2018-03-20 14:37:20	jesse	my laptops host name is whitebox and my raspberry pi is blackbox... since I am a lot closer understanding to the software to my arch linux os than I am on the standard raspberry pi os. 
2018-03-20 14:37:29	gjabell	lol xD 
2018-03-20 14:37:31	gjabell	that's pretty great 
2018-03-20 14:38:38	jesse	I saw some servers on System76's webpage that were the size of a raspberry pi but a ton better. If you're looking for portability, you should check those out. 
2018-03-20 14:38:52	jesse	They are a lil expensive though 
2018-03-20 14:39:04	jesse	I think they call them 'Meerkats' or something 
2018-03-20 14:39:12	gjabell	huh 
2018-03-20 14:40:09	jesse	https://system76.com/desktops/meerkat
2018-03-20 14:40:09		Meerkat
2018-03-20 14:40:09		Adorns your desk without consuming it. Small but fierce, Meerkat is the perfect combination of performance and efficiency. System76 desktop computers are custom-built to run Ubuntu flawlessly. 
2018-03-20 14:41:15	jesse	I think they advertise it more like a desktop, but I think it would act more functionally like a linux server...  
2018-03-20 14:41:19	gjabell	that's neat 
2018-03-20 14:57:50	gjabell	gogs is advertised as being able to run on a rasp pi btw, so if you end up going with a git host that seems like the way to go xD 
2018-03-20 14:59:13	jesse	thanks for letting me know!  it may be the first semiuseful use for my raspberry pi xD 
2018-03-20 15:00:45	gjabell	xD 
2018-03-20 15:00:54	gjabell	I haven't tried gogs yet but the interface looks pretty nice 
2018-03-20 15:02:20	jesse	something else I think would be useful, is if I got some nixie tubes (cuz theyre stylish), and hook it up in a way so that those tubes act as a physical progress bar  or timer for my super long scripts. 
2018-03-20 15:03:09	gjabell	that would be neat 
2018-03-20 15:03:12	gjabell	what are nixie tubes? 
2018-03-20 15:04:07	jesse	just google it. it was used before digital displays... kinda like neon signs but cool and orange 
2018-03-20 15:04:41	gjabell	that's fucking cool 
2018-03-20 15:04:45	gjabell	you should totally get some of those 
2018-03-20 15:04:48	jesse	right?!?! 
2018-03-20 15:05:22	gjabell	now I want some 
2018-03-20 15:05:29	gjabell	even though I have no idea what I'd use them for xD 
2018-03-20 15:05:47	jesse	xD even a clock would look super cool 
2018-03-20 15:06:01	gjabell	yeah 
2018-03-20 15:07:16	jesse	if im gonna do something like that, I should probably do it while im at state, cuz ill probably need a 3d printer 
2018-03-20 15:07:39	gjabell	hmm yeah 
2018-03-20 16:43:40	jesse	prof seems overly excited about projects that averaged at 80% xD 
2018-03-20 16:44:00	gjabell	lol yea xD 
2018-03-22 11:06:35		getting channel history...
2018-03-17 17:02:39	gjabell	so I don't think it actually makes it any slower 
2018-03-17 17:03:23	jesse	maybe not. im just trying to be light on plugins for now. 
2018-03-17 17:03:29	gjabell	that's fair 
2018-03-17 17:03:37	gjabell	I love plugins so I always go way overboard lol 
2018-03-17 17:04:22	jesse	plus if you ssh into another server and they dont have your plugins it kinda sucks. 
2018-03-17 17:04:31	gjabell	yeah true 
2018-03-17 17:04:43	gjabell	although there might be a way to tell ssh to use your own vim, I'm not sure about that 
2018-03-17 17:06:32	jesse	idk. btw I found a way to increase the font size of tty1 (no gui mode). if you feel like going true hacker without hurting your eyes a ton, youll need it. 
2018-03-17 17:06:54	gjabell	xD that's good 
2018-03-17 17:07:01	gjabell	is there a way to change color schemes? 
2018-03-17 17:07:48	jesse	dunno. there might be. im gonna play some video games instead of checking xD 
2018-03-17 17:07:56	gjabell	xD seems like a plan

2018-03-17 17:10:10	gjabell	survey says yes 
2018-03-17 17:11:42	jesse	no wayy!!! thats cool! but its gonna make me sad when I have to go back to windows for literally any job :( 
2018-03-17 17:11:53	gjabell	lol yeah xD 
2018-03-17 17:12:04	gjabell	some places will probably let you use linux if you want 
2018-03-17 17:12:13	gjabell	also you could always cygwin + stuff :) 
2018-03-17 17:12:24	gjabell	weechat is a supported package xD 
2018-03-17 17:12:29	jesse	its just not the same 
2018-03-17 17:12:51	jesse	we could just ssh into a raspberry pi or something 
2018-03-17 17:13:02	gjabell	lol yea 
2018-03-17 17:13:21	jesse	linux on raspberry pi > windows xD 
2018-03-17 17:13:26	gjabell	^ 
2018-03-17 17:13:33	gjabell	linux on anything > windows 
2018-03-17 17:13:37	gjabell	except for games lol 
2018-03-17 17:13:40	gjabell	most games taht is 
2018-03-17 17:13:50	jesse	TuxRacer 
2018-03-17 17:13:53	jesse	xD jk 
2018-03-17 17:13:56	gjabell	lol 
2018-03-18 17:58:36	gjabell	so I started doing some more with tmux today 
2018-03-18 17:58:40	gjabell	gotta say, it's pretty sweet 
2018-03-18 17:59:42	gjabell	unf there's a weird issue with mine where the background color doesn't get set correctly on vim or the status bar and I can't figure out why xD 
2018-03-18 17:59:48	gjabell	but other than that's it's quite nice 
2018-03-18 18:00:10	jesse	is the background a grayish color? 
2018-03-18 18:00:15	gjabell	yeah 
2018-03-18 18:00:23	jesse	lemme check something 
2018-03-18 18:00:36	gjabell	it's supposed to be a sort of dark blue 
2018-03-18 18:00:38	gjabell	like really dark 
2018-03-18 18:00:46	gjabell	but it ends up being a gray instead 
2018-03-18 18:01:05	gjabell	might be the terminal I'm using is confusing it, but I haven't had much success finding stuff about it online 
2018-03-18 18:03:21	jesse	you may need to put 
2018-03-18 18:03:21		export TERM=xterm-256color
2018-03-18 18:03:21		in your bashrc. 
2018-03-18 18:04:41	jesse	or go to whichever terminal you use and set it to that in its environment settings 
2018-03-18 18:04:56	gjabell	I don't think that's working for me, although it might be bc I'm using a different shell than bash 
2018-03-18 18:05:07	jesse	zsh? 
2018-03-18 18:05:11	gjabell	fish xD 
2018-03-18 18:05:20	jesse	lol wut 
2018-03-18 18:05:29	gjabell	there's something on the arch wiki under tmux about setting term for termite, which is what I'm doing, but it doesn't work either 
2018-03-18 18:05:34	gjabell	could also be an issue with my vim config 
2018-03-18 18:05:49	gjabell	it's pretty great, it's like zsh but with a lot of the things that you can plugin with zsh built in 
2018-03-18 18:05:57	gjabell	plus the scripting language is really nice 
2018-03-18 18:06:04	gjabell	and it has excellent highlighting 
2018-03-18 18:10:05	gjabell	well, and now it seems to be working lol 
2018-03-18 18:10:07	gjabell	fuck me 
2018-03-18 18:10:29	jesse	xD will you ever have a system thats "good enough"? 
2018-03-18 18:10:49	gjabell	I really hope not xD 
2018-03-18 18:10:55	jesse	i guess that defeats the purpose of technology 
2018-03-18 18:10:57	gjabell	bc if I ever do I'll probably get really board lol 
2018-03-18 18:11:14	jesse	hahaha true 
2018-03-18 18:11:29	jesse	id have no use for my computer 
2018-03-18 18:12:00	gjabell	pretty much yeah 
2018-03-20 10:21:39	jesse	Do you think a raspberry pi could host gitlab? 
2018-03-20 10:23:44	gjabell	hmm 
2018-03-20 10:23:44	gjabell	mayube 
2018-03-20 10:24:15	gjabell	apparently it wants 2cpu 4gb ram 
2018-03-20 10:24:18	gjabell	so maybe not 
2018-03-20 10:24:32	gjabell	although if it's just you it might work? but I've had issues with not having enough ram 
2018-03-20 10:24:35	gjabell	you could try gogs tho 
2018-03-20 10:24:40	gjabell	I think it's lighter weight 
2018-03-20 10:26:01	jesse	i might do that. id like to have all my dotfiles in a repo but not have to worry about passwords getting accidently pushed. 
2018-03-20 10:27:00	gjabell	yeah taht's a good idea 
2018-03-20 10:27:06	gjabell	that's what I've been doing, works like a charm 
2018-03-20 10:27:14	gjabell	plus you can make it public if you plug it in your room 
2018-03-20 10:27:30	jesse	hahaha true 
2018-03-20 10:27:50	jesse	thats so strange that that worked 
2018-03-20 10:28:42	gjabell	ikr 
2018-03-20 10:28:46	gjabell	it's weird but wonderful 
2018-03-20 10:28:59	gjabell	do you use a password manager? 
2018-03-20 10:29:13	jesse	yeah. I've been using LastPass. 
2018-03-20 10:29:19	gjabell	does it have a cli? 
2018-03-20 10:29:28	jesse	nope.. but it does have phone support 
2018-03-20 10:29:32	gjabell	ok 
2018-03-20 10:29:43	gjabell	if you ever get tired of a gui password manager, you should check out pass :) 
2018-03-20 10:30:00	gjabell	fully command line, encrypts passwords using a gpg key, and it integrates with git 
2018-03-20 10:30:02	gjabell	it's awesome 
2018-03-20 10:30:02	jesse	(you can use on phone... not you can call them and get some indian guy to help you when you forget your password...) 
2018-03-20 10:30:07	gjabell	lol xD 
2018-03-20 10:30:10	jesse	xD 
2018-03-20 10:31:05	jesse	I'll look into pass, but I'm pretty happy with lastpass. It's even got this neat feature that automatically changes your password on common sites. 
2018-03-20 10:31:14	jesse	not that I actually use that one 
2018-03-20 10:31:19	jesse	but its cool 
2018-03-20 10:31:32	gjabell	that's fair 
2018-03-20 10:31:34	gjabell	yeah that is nice 
2018-03-20 10:31:49	gjabell	I like pass bc I can use my yubikey to decrypt / encrypt stuff lol 
2018-03-20 10:31:57	gjabell	although I think lastpass integrates with it as well, so 
2018-03-20 10:33:25	jesse	whats a yubikey? 
2018-03-20 10:33:37	jesse	is that your special flashdrive? 
2018-03-20 10:34:34	gjabell	yeah 
2018-03-20 10:34:42	gjabell	it's a security key, you can use it for 2fa 
2018-03-20 10:34:47	gjabell	but it can also store gpg keys 
2018-03-20 10:35:03	gjabell	so I have my private key on it, which means I can only decrypt my passwords if I have the yubikey 
2018-03-20 10:35:21	gjabell	so even if someone stole my laptop or broke into my git, the pass directory would be useless unless they also had my key 
2018-03-20 10:41:38	jesse	I want whoever is trying to get into my stuff to have the most annoying process of trying to get in. I want them to have to use facial recognition from a real panda, use my pinky toes fingerprint, And get a high score on dance dance revolution before they can get into my computer. 
2018-03-20 10:42:15	gjabell	lol xD 
2018-03-20 10:42:22	jesse	And the gui would just be a gif of confetti with subtitles like "you did it" 
2018-03-20 10:42:27	gjabell	lol 
2018-03-20 10:42:34	gjabell	you should do that 
2018-03-20 10:42:35	jesse	or "sorry mario, but your princess is in another castle" 
2018-03-20 10:42:46	gjabell	make a honeypot with all that xD 
2018-03-20 10:43:21	jesse	If only people saw me as einstein and actually wanted into my stuff. 
2018-03-20 10:43:37	jesse	step 1: become einstein. 
2018-03-20 10:43:48	gjabell	I'm sure some random people in asia would be willing to take a crack 
2018-03-20 10:43:50	gjabell	or russia 
2018-03-20 10:44:13	gjabell	I had a server on digitalocean with fail2ban on it at one point, and I was getting 10-15 emails a day about people trying to break into it lol 
2018-03-20 10:44:37	jesse	what is fail2ban? 
2018-03-20 10:44:55	gjabell	it's a daemon that runs, watching the ssh logs for your server 
2018-03-20 10:45:18	gjabell	and if an ip fails to authenticate x number of times (which you can set), it adds a firewall rule to permanently block that ip from accessing anything 
2018-03-20 10:45:32	gjabell	so if people are trying to ssh into your server, it'll ban them if they can't authenticate 
2018-03-20 10:45:43	gjabell	basically just prevents brute force attacks 
2018-03-20 10:45:54	gjabell	which is kind of irrelevant if you are using ssh keys, but still 
2018-03-20 10:48:04	jesse	Hahaha my brother would have me banned then xD sometimes I'll change his wallpaper, or have recursively linked empty porn directories like in XKCD... But its okay, cuz he gave me permission.  
2018-03-20 10:50:09	gjabell	lol xD 
2018-03-20 10:50:17	gjabell	I accidentally banned myself once lol 
2018-03-20 10:50:32	jesse	What?! Thats awesome!! 
2018-03-20 10:53:05	gjabell	yeah, I was trying out a 2fa thing and it didn't work well, so when I went to ssh in again, it had blocked me xD 
2018-03-20 10:53:17	gjabell	I had to go to the digitalocean console and delete my ip from iptables lol 
2018-03-20 10:53:29	gjabell	I was really confused at first, before I realized what had happened 
2018-03-20 10:57:52	jesse	Sounds like that digitalocean console is a big security risk... 
2018-03-20 10:58:13	jesse	better patch that up galen.  
2018-03-20 10:58:19	gjabell	lol xD 
2018-03-20 10:58:22	gjabell	2fa ftw 
2018-03-20 14:23:33	gjabell	do you know what your team got on the plm project? 
2018-03-20 14:26:33	jesse	90. 
2018-03-20 14:26:37	jesse	you? 
2018-03-20 14:27:11	gjabell	80 
2018-03-20 14:27:28	gjabell	we went and talked with him about it bc we thought it was from us using gitlab even though we were given permission to use it 
2018-03-20 14:28:01	gjabell	but apparently it's because ours was 'just a project' and some teams 'deserved more points' 
2018-03-20 14:28:32	gjabell	which is fair, but since we gave him what the instructions asked for it seems a bit unfair to dock points from teams that didn't do as much as other teams rather than giving those teams extra points or something 
2018-03-20 14:28:33	gjabell	idk 
2018-03-20 14:28:50	jesse	ah i gotcha. we got points off cuz we didnt implement an FSM. even though the teacher just said to implement the card games "in any way that works" 
2018-03-20 14:29:09	gjabell	ok, so effectively the same reason we lost points 
2018-03-20 14:29:18	gjabell	that strikes me as a bit bs 
2018-03-20 14:30:49	jesse	I agree, but ya have to remember how little grades actually matter. No matter what we do, we will pass this class and graduate. Beyond that, if a company rejects me on the basis of gpa, I wouldn't want to work for them anyway. 
2018-03-20 14:30:59	gjabell	that's true 
2018-03-20 14:31:55	jesse	Besides, knowing us, we'll probably setup our own personal labs if we get bored working a standard programming job xD 
2018-03-20 14:32:21	gjabell	lol xD 
2018-03-20 14:32:24	gjabell	you know it 
2018-03-20 14:32:34	jesse	you've basically already got one. Your living room xD 
2018-03-20 14:32:49	gjabell	lol 
2018-03-20 14:32:57	gjabell	I actually just sold everything on sunday :P 
2018-03-20 14:33:39	jesse	you'll get bored eventually and buy it back... or something better... 
2018-03-20 14:33:55	jesse	your servers? 
2018-03-20 14:34:04	gjabell	yeah xD 
2018-03-20 14:34:13	gjabell	but I already bought of bunch of stuff for a white box build so we good lol 
2018-03-20 14:34:36	gjabell	I love the enterprise gear but moving it was going to be such a pain 
2018-03-20 14:34:43	jesse	haha whats it mean to be a whitebox build? you build it yourself? 
2018-03-20 14:34:50	gjabell	so I just put it up on craigslist on the offchance someone wanted it, and they did lol 
2018-03-20 14:35:00	gjabell	yeah, basically just custom built server in a normal computer case 
2018-03-20 14:37:20	jesse	my laptops host name is whitebox and my raspberry pi is blackbox... since I am a lot closer understanding to the software to my arch linux os than I am on the standard raspberry pi os. 
2018-03-20 14:37:29	gjabell	lol xD 
2018-03-20 14:37:31	gjabell	that's pretty great 
2018-03-20 14:38:38	jesse	I saw some servers on System76's webpage that were the size of a raspberry pi but a ton better. If you're looking for portability, you should check those out. 
2018-03-20 14:38:52	jesse	They are a lil expensive though 
2018-03-20 14:39:04	jesse	I think they call them 'Meerkats' or something 
2018-03-20 14:39:12	gjabell	huh 
2018-03-20 14:40:09	jesse	https://system76.com/desktops/meerkat
2018-03-20 14:40:09		Meerkat
2018-03-20 14:40:09		Adorns your desk without consuming it. Small but fierce, Meerkat is the perfect combination of performance and efficiency. System76 desktop computers are custom-built to run Ubuntu flawlessly. 
2018-03-20 14:41:15	jesse	I think they advertise it more like a desktop, but I think it would act more functionally like a linux server...  
2018-03-20 14:41:19	gjabell	that's neat 
2018-03-20 14:57:50	gjabell	gogs is advertised as being able to run on a rasp pi btw, so if you end up going with a git host that seems like the way to go xD 
2018-03-20 14:59:13	jesse	thanks for letting me know!  it may be the first semiuseful use for my raspberry pi xD 
2018-03-20 15:00:45	gjabell	xD 
2018-03-20 15:00:54	gjabell	I haven't tried gogs yet but the interface looks pretty nice 
2018-03-20 15:02:20	jesse	something else I think would be useful, is if I got some nixie tubes (cuz theyre stylish), and hook it up in a way so that those tubes act as a physical progress bar  or timer for my super long scripts. 
2018-03-20 15:03:09	gjabell	that would be neat 
2018-03-20 15:03:12	gjabell	what are nixie tubes? 
2018-03-20 15:04:07	jesse	just google it. it was used before digital displays... kinda like neon signs but cool and orange 
2018-03-20 15:04:41	gjabell	that's fucking cool 
2018-03-20 15:04:45	gjabell	you should totally get some of those 
2018-03-20 15:04:48	jesse	right?!?! 
2018-03-20 15:05:22	gjabell	now I want some 
2018-03-20 15:05:29	gjabell	even though I have no idea what I'd use them for xD 
2018-03-20 15:05:47	jesse	xD even a clock would look super cool 
2018-03-20 15:06:01	gjabell	yeah 
2018-03-20 15:07:16	jesse	if im gonna do something like that, I should probably do it while im at state, cuz ill probably need a 3d printer 
2018-03-20 15:07:39	gjabell	hmm yeah 
2018-03-20 16:43:40	jesse	prof seems overly excited about projects that averaged at 80% xD 
2018-03-20 16:44:00	gjabell	lol yea xD 
2018-03-21 14:48:58	jesse	@jesse uploaded a file: https://sturgill-operators.slack.com/files/U3VPX29FW/F9TNYHJLB/img8611960849298959685.jpg (Slack for Android Upload) 
2018-03-21 14:49:28	jesse	because i want you to lose points on not having a cheesy narrative. 
2018-03-21 14:49:32	jesse	xD 
2018-03-21 14:57:58	gjabell	XD 
2018-03-21 20:56:35	gjabell	you're taking the 12 o'clock senior design with king, right? 
2018-03-21 21:03:04	jesse	i think so. but i think it conflicts with the time my research meeting typically meets so Im not entirely sure. 
2018-03-21 21:05:28	gjabell	Ah, ok 
2018-03-21 21:11:52	jesse	i think no matter what, the section will be during my research meeting, so I dont think ill change it. Id prefer king over heckman anyway. 
2018-03-21 21:13:13	jesse	nevermind its actually a different class blocking my research. 
2018-03-21 21:18:59	gjabell	Yeah 
2018-03-21 21:19:03	gjabell	Ah, rip 
2018-03-21 21:20:33	jesse	yeah. I was actually planning on dropping one of my csc restricted electives to do my research for credit so my schedule could still work. unfortunately, it would mean I wouldnt be able to take software security... which would be a bummer to me. 
2018-03-21 21:21:06	gjabell	Ah
2018-03-21 21:21:06		Yeah that's annoying 
2018-03-22 11:08:47	jesse	https://github.com/piotrmurach/github_cli 
2018-03-22 11:09:27	jesse	I was looking for a way to view git issues in the terminal and I think i found it. 
2018-03-22 11:10:18	gjabell	Yo 
2018-03-22 11:10:22	gjabell	That's neat 
2018-03-22 12:28:09	jesse	I actually couldn't get it to install using gem. rather, it installed but couldn't run. 
2018-03-22 12:28:26	gjabell	Rip 
2018-03-22 12:29:15	jesse	I'll find a way lol... after I stop procrastinating on my game log 
2018-03-22 12:29:31	gjabell	XD 
2018-03-22 12:29:39	gjabell	I haven't even started lol 
2018-03-22 12:30:34	jesse	nice. unfortunately playing through a story game more than once and recording all your choices/decisions takes a ton of time. 
2018-03-22 12:38:18	gjabell	Yeah 
2018-03-22 12:38:29	gjabell	I'm just going to do the Stanley parable 
2018-03-22 12:39:24	jesse	I'm not sure what that is, but if you're using 'just' to describe it, then it sounds like a good choice... depression quest is kinda long. 
2018-03-22 12:43:13	gjabell	XD yeah the play through are pretty short 
2018-03-22 12:45:21	gjabell	Also idk if you have figured out summer housing yet, but I found out yesterday that they'll let people stay in WR even if they aren't doing summer school 
2018-03-22 12:47:34	jesse	wow really? when they emailed me a month ago, they said the opposite. I think I'm gonna be staying at my brother's place, but I don't really like that plan (other than not having to pay). 
2018-03-22 12:48:43	gjabell	Yeah I know, they just changed their minds xD
2018-03-22 12:48:43		That's fair
2018-03-22 12:48:43		If you decide to go with WR let me know and I'll add you as a preferred roommate if you want 
2018-03-22 13:05:26	jesse	Thanks, I probably won't though. If my brother doesn't want me taking his room, I'll definitely message you though.  
2018-03-22 13:05:39	jesse	Did housing for summer open up? 
2018-03-22 13:05:49	jesse	or has it been up? 
2018-03-22 13:13:27	gjabell	Sounds good
2018-03-22 13:13:27		Idk, they just made it an option so 
2018-03-22 15:12:30	jesse	do you know how long your going to make your game log? its gonna be structured differently than what we're used to. 
2018-03-22 15:13:35	gjabell	I honestly haven't looked into it much 
2018-03-22 15:14:00	gjabell	If there aren't any length requirements I'll just make it as little as possible while still answering the questions xD 
2018-03-22 15:15:19	jesse	yeah im thinking Ill just answer the questions and be done. it just concerns me that theyre using the word "essay" to describe the log. essay makes me think 12 pages xD 
2018-03-22 15:15:49	jesse	that diagram i made was a nightmare 
2018-03-22 16:58:55		getting channel history...
2018-03-18 17:59:42	gjabell	unf there's a weird issue with mine where the background color doesn't get set correctly on vim or the status bar and I can't figure out why xD 
2018-03-18 17:59:48	gjabell	but other than that's it's quite nice 
2018-03-18 18:00:10	jesse	is the background a grayish color? 
2018-03-18 18:00:15	gjabell	yeah 
2018-03-18 18:00:23	jesse	lemme check something 
2018-03-18 18:00:36	gjabell	it's supposed to be a sort of dark blue 
2018-03-18 18:00:38	gjabell	like really dark 
2018-03-18 18:00:46	gjabell	but it ends up being a gray instead 
2018-03-18 18:01:05	gjabell	might be the terminal I'm using is confusing it, but I haven't had much success finding stuff about it online 
2018-03-18 18:03:21	jesse	you may need to put 
2018-03-18 18:03:21		export TERM=xterm-256color
2018-03-18 18:03:21		in your bashrc. 
2018-03-18 18:04:41	jesse	or go to whichever terminal you use and set it to that in its environment settings 
2018-03-18 18:04:56	gjabell	I don't think that's working for me, although it might be bc I'm using a different shell than bash 
2018-03-18 18:05:07	jesse	zsh? 
2018-03-18 18:05:11	gjabell	fish xD 
2018-03-18 18:05:20	jesse	lol wut 
2018-03-18 18:05:29	gjabell	there's something on the arch wiki under tmux about setting term for termite, which is what I'm doing, but it doesn't work either 
2018-03-18 18:05:34	gjabell	could also be an issue with my vim config 
2018-03-18 18:05:49	gjabell	it's pretty great, it's like zsh but with a lot of the things that you can plugin with zsh built in 
2018-03-18 18:05:57	gjabell	plus the scripting language is really nice 
2018-03-18 18:06:04	gjabell	and it has excellent highlighting 
2018-03-18 18:10:05	gjabell	well, and now it seems to be working lol 
2018-03-18 18:10:07	gjabell	fuck me 
2018-03-18 18:10:29	jesse	xD will you ever have a system thats "good enough"? 
2018-03-18 18:10:49	gjabell	I really hope not xD 
2018-03-18 18:10:55	jesse	i guess that defeats the purpose of technology 
2018-03-18 18:10:57	gjabell	bc if I ever do I'll probably get really board lol 
2018-03-18 18:11:14	jesse	hahaha true 
2018-03-18 18:11:29	jesse	id have no use for my computer 
2018-03-18 18:12:00	gjabell	pretty much yeah 
2018-03-20 10:21:39	jesse	Do you think a raspberry pi could host gitlab? 
2018-03-20 10:23:44	gjabell	hmm 
2018-03-20 10:23:44	gjabell	mayube 
2018-03-20 10:24:15	gjabell	apparently it wants 2cpu 4gb ram 
2018-03-20 10:24:18	gjabell	so maybe not 
2018-03-20 10:24:32	gjabell	although if it's just you it might work? but I've had issues with not having enough ram 
2018-03-20 10:24:35	gjabell	you could try gogs tho 
2018-03-20 10:24:40	gjabell	I think it's lighter weight 
2018-03-20 10:26:01	jesse	i might do that. id like to have all my dotfiles in a repo but not have to worry about passwords getting accidently pushed. 
2018-03-20 10:27:00	gjabell	yeah taht's a good idea 
2018-03-20 10:27:06	gjabell	that's what I've been doing, works like a charm 
2018-03-20 10:27:14	gjabell	plus you can make it public if you plug it in your room 
2018-03-20 10:27:30	jesse	hahaha true 
2018-03-20 10:27:50	jesse	thats so strange that that worked 
2018-03-20 10:28:42	gjabell	ikr 
2018-03-20 10:28:46	gjabell	it's weird but wonderful 
2018-03-20 10:28:59	gjabell	do you use a password manager? 
2018-03-20 10:29:13	jesse	yeah. I've been using LastPass. 
2018-03-20 10:29:19	gjabell	does it have a cli? 
2018-03-20 10:29:28	jesse	nope.. but it does have phone support 
2018-03-20 10:29:32	gjabell	ok 
2018-03-20 10:29:43	gjabell	if you ever get tired of a gui password manager, you should check out pass :) 
2018-03-20 10:30:00	gjabell	fully command line, encrypts passwords using a gpg key, and it integrates with git 
2018-03-20 10:30:02	gjabell	it's awesome 
2018-03-20 10:30:02	jesse	(you can use on phone... not you can call them and get some indian guy to help you when you forget your password...) 
2018-03-20 10:30:07	gjabell	lol xD 
2018-03-20 10:30:10	jesse	xD 
2018-03-20 10:31:05	jesse	I'll look into pass, but I'm pretty happy with lastpass. It's even got this neat feature that automatically changes your password on common sites. 
2018-03-20 10:31:14	jesse	not that I actually use that one 
2018-03-20 10:31:19	jesse	but its cool 
2018-03-20 10:31:32	gjabell	that's fair 
2018-03-20 10:31:34	gjabell	yeah that is nice 
2018-03-20 10:31:49	gjabell	I like pass bc I can use my yubikey to decrypt / encrypt stuff lol 
2018-03-20 10:31:57	gjabell	although I think lastpass integrates with it as well, so 
2018-03-20 10:33:25	jesse	whats a yubikey? 
2018-03-20 10:33:37	jesse	is that your special flashdrive? 
2018-03-20 10:34:34	gjabell	yeah 
2018-03-20 10:34:42	gjabell	it's a security key, you can use it for 2fa 
2018-03-20 10:34:47	gjabell	but it can also store gpg keys 
2018-03-20 10:35:03	gjabell	so I have my private key on it, which means I can only decrypt my passwords if I have the yubikey 
2018-03-20 10:35:21	gjabell	so even if someone stole my laptop or broke into my git, the pass directory would be useless unless they also had my key 
2018-03-20 10:41:38	jesse	I want whoever is trying to get into my stuff to have the most annoying process of trying to get in. I want them to have to use facial recognition from a real panda, use my pinky toes fingerprint, And get a high score on dance dance revolution before they can get into my computer. 
2018-03-20 10:42:15	gjabell	lol xD 
2018-03-20 10:42:22	jesse	And the gui would just be a gif of confetti with subtitles like "you did it" 
2018-03-20 10:42:27	gjabell	lol 
2018-03-20 10:42:34	gjabell	you should do that 
2018-03-20 10:42:35	jesse	or "sorry mario, but your princess is in another castle" 
2018-03-20 10:42:46	gjabell	make a honeypot with all that xD 
2018-03-20 10:43:21	jesse	If only people saw me as einstein and actually wanted into my stuff. 
2018-03-20 10:43:37	jesse	step 1: become einstein. 
2018-03-20 10:43:48	gjabell	I'm sure some random people in asia would be willing to take a crack 
2018-03-20 10:43:50	gjabell	or russia 
2018-03-20 10:44:13	gjabell	I had a server on digitalocean with fail2ban on it at one point, and I was getting 10-15 emails a day about people trying to break into it lol 
2018-03-20 10:44:37	jesse	what is fail2ban? 
2018-03-20 10:44:55	gjabell	it's a daemon that runs, watching the ssh logs for your server 
2018-03-20 10:45:18	gjabell	and if an ip fails to authenticate x number of times (which you can set), it adds a firewall rule to permanently block that ip from accessing anything 
2018-03-20 10:45:32	gjabell	so if people are trying to ssh into your server, it'll ban them if they can't authenticate 
2018-03-20 10:45:43	gjabell	basically just prevents brute force attacks 
2018-03-20 10:45:54	gjabell	which is kind of irrelevant if you are using ssh keys, but still 
2018-03-20 10:48:04	jesse	Hahaha my brother would have me banned then xD sometimes I'll change his wallpaper, or have recursively linked empty porn directories like in XKCD... But its okay, cuz he gave me permission.  
2018-03-20 10:50:09	gjabell	lol xD 
2018-03-20 10:50:17	gjabell	I accidentally banned myself once lol 
2018-03-20 10:50:32	jesse	What?! Thats awesome!! 
2018-03-20 10:53:05	gjabell	yeah, I was trying out a 2fa thing and it didn't work well, so when I went to ssh in again, it had blocked me xD 
2018-03-20 10:53:17	gjabell	I had to go to the digitalocean console and delete my ip from iptables lol 
2018-03-20 10:53:29	gjabell	I was really confused at first, before I realized what had happened 
2018-03-20 10:57:52	jesse	Sounds like that digitalocean console is a big security risk... 
2018-03-20 10:58:13	jesse	better patch that up galen.  
2018-03-20 10:58:19	gjabell	lol xD 
2018-03-20 10:58:22	gjabell	2fa ftw 
2018-03-20 14:23:33	gjabell	do you know what your team got on the plm project? 
2018-03-20 14:26:33	jesse	90. 
2018-03-20 14:26:37	jesse	you? 
2018-03-20 14:27:11	gjabell	80 
2018-03-20 14:27:28	gjabell	we went and talked with him about it bc we thought it was from us using gitlab even though we were given permission to use it 
2018-03-20 14:28:01	gjabell	but apparently it's because ours was 'just a project' and some teams 'deserved more points' 
2018-03-20 14:28:32	gjabell	which is fair, but since we gave him what the instructions asked for it seems a bit unfair to dock points from teams that didn't do as much as other teams rather than giving those teams extra points or something 
2018-03-20 14:28:33	gjabell	idk 
2018-03-20 14:28:50	jesse	ah i gotcha. we got points off cuz we didnt implement an FSM. even though the teacher just said to implement the card games "in any way that works" 
2018-03-20 14:29:09	gjabell	ok, so effectively the same reason we lost points 
2018-03-20 14:29:18	gjabell	that strikes me as a bit bs 
2018-03-20 14:30:49	jesse	I agree, but ya have to remember how little grades actually matter. No matter what we do, we will pass this class and graduate. Beyond that, if a company rejects me on the basis of gpa, I wouldn't want to work for them anyway. 
2018-03-20 14:30:59	gjabell	that's true 
2018-03-20 14:31:55	jesse	Besides, knowing us, we'll probably setup our own personal labs if we get bored working a standard programming job xD 
2018-03-20 14:32:21	gjabell	lol xD 
2018-03-20 14:32:24	gjabell	you know it 
2018-03-20 14:32:34	jesse	you've basically already got one. Your living room xD 
2018-03-20 14:32:49	gjabell	lol 
2018-03-20 14:32:57	gjabell	I actually just sold everything on sunday :P 
2018-03-20 14:33:39	jesse	you'll get bored eventually and buy it back... or something better... 
2018-03-20 14:33:55	jesse	your servers? 
2018-03-20 14:34:04	gjabell	yeah xD 
2018-03-20 14:34:13	gjabell	but I already bought of bunch of stuff for a white box build so we good lol 
2018-03-20 14:34:36	gjabell	I love the enterprise gear but moving it was going to be such a pain 
2018-03-20 14:34:43	jesse	haha whats it mean to be a whitebox build? you build it yourself? 
2018-03-20 14:34:50	gjabell	so I just put it up on craigslist on the offchance someone wanted it, and they did lol 
2018-03-20 14:35:00	gjabell	yeah, basically just custom built server in a normal computer case 
2018-03-20 14:37:20	jesse	my laptops host name is whitebox and my raspberry pi is blackbox... since I am a lot closer understanding to the software to my arch linux os than I am on the standard raspberry pi os. 
2018-03-20 14:37:29	gjabell	lol xD 
2018-03-20 14:37:31	gjabell	that's pretty great 
2018-03-20 14:38:38	jesse	I saw some servers on System76's webpage that were the size of a raspberry pi but a ton better. If you're looking for portability, you should check those out. 
2018-03-20 14:38:52	jesse	They are a lil expensive though 
2018-03-20 14:39:04	jesse	I think they call them 'Meerkats' or something 
2018-03-20 14:39:12	gjabell	huh 
2018-03-20 14:40:09	jesse	https://system76.com/desktops/meerkat
2018-03-20 14:40:09		Meerkat
2018-03-20 14:40:09		Adorns your desk without consuming it. Small but fierce, Meerkat is the perfect combination of performance and efficiency. System76 desktop computers are custom-built to run Ubuntu flawlessly. 
2018-03-20 14:41:15	jesse	I think they advertise it more like a desktop, but I think it would act more functionally like a linux server...  
2018-03-20 14:41:19	gjabell	that's neat 
2018-03-20 14:57:50	gjabell	gogs is advertised as being able to run on a rasp pi btw, so if you end up going with a git host that seems like the way to go xD 
2018-03-20 14:59:13	jesse	thanks for letting me know!  it may be the first semiuseful use for my raspberry pi xD 
2018-03-20 15:00:45	gjabell	xD 
2018-03-20 15:00:54	gjabell	I haven't tried gogs yet but the interface looks pretty nice 
2018-03-20 15:02:20	jesse	something else I think would be useful, is if I got some nixie tubes (cuz theyre stylish), and hook it up in a way so that those tubes act as a physical progress bar  or timer for my super long scripts. 
2018-03-20 15:03:09	gjabell	that would be neat 
2018-03-20 15:03:12	gjabell	what are nixie tubes? 
2018-03-20 15:04:07	jesse	just google it. it was used before digital displays... kinda like neon signs but cool and orange 
2018-03-20 15:04:41	gjabell	that's fucking cool 
2018-03-20 15:04:45	gjabell	you should totally get some of those 
2018-03-20 15:04:48	jesse	right?!?! 
2018-03-20 15:05:22	gjabell	now I want some 
2018-03-20 15:05:29	gjabell	even though I have no idea what I'd use them for xD 
2018-03-20 15:05:47	jesse	xD even a clock would look super cool 
2018-03-20 15:06:01	gjabell	yeah 
2018-03-20 15:07:16	jesse	if im gonna do something like that, I should probably do it while im at state, cuz ill probably need a 3d printer 
2018-03-20 15:07:39	gjabell	hmm yeah 
2018-03-20 16:43:40	jesse	prof seems overly excited about projects that averaged at 80% xD 
2018-03-20 16:44:00	gjabell	lol yea xD 
2018-03-21 14:48:58	jesse	@jesse uploaded a file: https://sturgill-operators.slack.com/files/U3VPX29FW/F9TNYHJLB/img8611960849298959685.jpg (Slack for Android Upload) 
2018-03-21 14:49:28	jesse	because i want you to lose points on not having a cheesy narrative. 
2018-03-21 14:49:32	jesse	xD 
2018-03-21 14:57:58	gjabell	XD 
2018-03-21 20:56:35	gjabell	you're taking the 12 o'clock senior design with king, right? 
2018-03-21 21:03:04	jesse	i think so. but i think it conflicts with the time my research meeting typically meets so Im not entirely sure. 
2018-03-21 21:05:28	gjabell	Ah, ok 
2018-03-21 21:11:52	jesse	i think no matter what, the section will be during my research meeting, so I dont think ill change it. Id prefer king over heckman anyway. 
2018-03-21 21:13:13	jesse	nevermind its actually a different class blocking my research. 
2018-03-21 21:18:59	gjabell	Yeah 
2018-03-21 21:19:03	gjabell	Ah, rip 
2018-03-21 21:20:33	jesse	yeah. I was actually planning on dropping one of my csc restricted electives to do my research for credit so my schedule could still work. unfortunately, it would mean I wouldnt be able to take software security... which would be a bummer to me. 
2018-03-21 21:21:06	gjabell	Ah
2018-03-21 21:21:06		Yeah that's annoying 
2018-03-22 11:08:47	jesse	https://github.com/piotrmurach/github_cli
2018-03-22 11:08:47		piotrmurach/github_cli
2018-03-22 11:08:47		github_cli - CLI-based access to GitHub API v3 
2018-03-22 11:09:27	jesse	I was looking for a way to view git issues in the terminal and I think i found it. 
2018-03-22 11:10:18	gjabell	Yo 
2018-03-22 11:10:22	gjabell	That's neat 
2018-03-22 12:28:09	jesse	I actually couldn't get it to install using gem. rather, it installed but couldn't run. 
2018-03-22 12:28:26	gjabell	Rip 
2018-03-22 12:29:15	jesse	I'll find a way lol... after I stop procrastinating on my game log 
2018-03-22 12:29:31	gjabell	XD 
2018-03-22 12:29:39	gjabell	I haven't even started lol 
2018-03-22 12:30:34	jesse	nice. unfortunately playing through a story game more than once and recording all your choices/decisions takes a ton of time. 
2018-03-22 12:38:18	gjabell	Yeah 
2018-03-22 12:38:29	gjabell	I'm just going to do the Stanley parable 
2018-03-22 12:39:24	jesse	I'm not sure what that is, but if you're using 'just' to describe it, then it sounds like a good choice... depression quest is kinda long. 
2018-03-22 12:43:13	gjabell	XD yeah the play through are pretty short 
2018-03-22 12:45:21	gjabell	Also idk if you have figured out summer housing yet, but I found out yesterday that they'll let people stay in WR even if they aren't doing summer school 
2018-03-22 12:47:34	jesse	wow really? when they emailed me a month ago, they said the opposite. I think I'm gonna be staying at my brother's place, but I don't really like that plan (other than not having to pay). 
2018-03-22 12:48:43	gjabell	Yeah I know, they just changed their minds xD
2018-03-22 12:48:43		That's fair
2018-03-22 12:48:43		If you decide to go with WR let me know and I'll add you as a preferred roommate if you want 
2018-03-22 13:05:26	jesse	Thanks, I probably won't though. If my brother doesn't want me taking his room, I'll definitely message you though.  
2018-03-22 13:05:39	jesse	Did housing for summer open up? 
2018-03-22 13:05:49	jesse	or has it been up? 
2018-03-22 13:13:27	gjabell	Sounds good
2018-03-22 13:13:27		Idk, they just made it an option so 
2018-03-22 15:12:30	jesse	do you know how long your going to make your game log? its gonna be structured differently than what we're used to. 
2018-03-22 15:13:35	gjabell	I honestly haven't looked into it much 
2018-03-22 15:14:00	gjabell	If there aren't any length requirements I'll just make it as little as possible while still answering the questions xD 
2018-03-22 15:15:19	jesse	yeah im thinking Ill just answer the questions and be done. it just concerns me that theyre using the word "essay" to describe the log. essay makes me think 12 pages xD 
2018-03-22 15:15:49	jesse	that diagram i made was a nightmare 
2018-03-22 15:16:52	gjabell	lol 
2018-03-22 15:18:06	gjabell	idk, it seems like it should be about as much content as the last game logs, including the diagram 
2018-03-22 15:18:09	jesse	plant uml helped but i had to split it into 5 pages/ 5 different diagrams 
2018-03-22 15:18:20	gjabell	so if the diagram has content then you probably don't need as much writing 
2018-03-22 15:18:22	gjabell	lol 
2018-03-22 15:18:26	gjabell	plant uml ftw 
2018-03-22 16:59:31	jesse	I made it so I can type tab anywhere on the current line and tab the whole line across :) . 
2018-03-22 17:00:41	jesse	and untabbing works too  
2018-03-22 17:35:11	gjabell	Bruh 
2018-03-22 17:35:15	gjabell	That's sweet@ 
2018-03-22 17:36:16	jesse	i can give you the lines in my vimrc, but you probably know how to do it. 
2018-03-22 17:36:54	jesse	map <Tab> :s/^/    <CR> 
2018-03-22 17:36:54	jesse	map <S-Tab> :s/^    /<CR> 
2018-03-22 17:37:09	gjabell	I actually don't know much about vimscript, so thanks xD 
2018-03-22 17:37:33	jesse	works in visual mode too. just highlight the lines you wanna change the indentation to. 
2018-03-22 17:37:59	jesse	those are the only two lines I use :) 
2018-03-22 17:43:50	gjabell	Neat 
2018-03-22 17:44:29	gjabell	mine is super long bc I just grabbed a bunch of stuff from other ones I've seen xD 
2018-03-22 17:44:41	gjabell	I've been slowly getting use to using the different plugins tho 
2018-03-22 17:44:45	gjabell	some of them are super nice 
2018-03-22 17:45:17	jesse	the only bad thing is that the selected text goes away. If you wanted to indent more than once, you have to highlight again. However, if you need to un-indent multiple times, you should probably refactor xD 
2018-03-22 17:45:28	gjabell	ah 
2018-03-22 17:45:29	gjabell	yeah xD 
2018-03-22 18:08:26	jesse	do you think 1.7 pages of text .7 pages of 2 small pictures  and 5 pages of a giant flowchart is good enough for this game log? 
2018-03-22 18:08:43	gjabell	Probably yeah 
2018-03-22 18:08:50	gjabell	They're pretty lenient on grading 
2018-03-22 21:08:19		getting channel history...
2018-03-20 10:29:13	jesse	yeah. I've been using LastPass. 
2018-03-20 10:29:19	gjabell	does it have a cli? 
2018-03-20 10:29:28	jesse	nope.. but it does have phone support 
2018-03-20 10:29:32	gjabell	ok 
2018-03-20 10:29:43	gjabell	if you ever get tired of a gui password manager, you should check out pass :) 
2018-03-20 10:30:00	gjabell	fully command line, encrypts passwords using a gpg key, and it integrates with git 
2018-03-20 10:30:02	gjabell	it's awesome 
2018-03-20 10:30:02	jesse	(you can use on phone... not you can call them and get some indian guy to help you when you forget your password...) 
2018-03-20 10:30:07	gjabell	lol xD 
2018-03-20 10:30:10	jesse	xD 
2018-03-20 10:31:05	jesse	I'll look into pass, but I'm pretty happy with lastpass. It's even got this neat feature that automatically changes your password on common sites. 
2018-03-20 10:31:14	jesse	not that I actually use that one 
2018-03-20 10:31:19	jesse	but its cool 
2018-03-20 10:31:32	gjabell	that's fair 
2018-03-20 10:31:34	gjabell	yeah that is nice 
2018-03-20 10:31:49	gjabell	I like pass bc I can use my yubikey to decrypt / encrypt stuff lol 
2018-03-20 10:31:57	gjabell	although I think lastpass integrates with it as well, so 
2018-03-20 10:33:25	jesse	whats a yubikey? 
2018-03-20 10:33:37	jesse	is that your special flashdrive? 
2018-03-20 10:34:34	gjabell	yeah 
2018-03-20 10:34:42	gjabell	it's a security key, you can use it for 2fa 
2018-03-20 10:34:47	gjabell	but it can also store gpg keys 
2018-03-20 10:35:03	gjabell	so I have my private key on it, which means I can only decrypt my passwords if I have the yubikey 
2018-03-20 10:35:21	gjabell	so even if someone stole my laptop or broke into my git, the pass directory would be useless unless they also had my key 
2018-03-20 10:41:38	jesse	I want whoever is trying to get into my stuff to have the most annoying process of trying to get in. I want them to have to use facial recognition from a real panda, use my pinky toes fingerprint, And get a high score on dance dance revolution before they can get into my computer. 
2018-03-20 10:42:15	gjabell	lol xD 
2018-03-20 10:42:22	jesse	And the gui would just be a gif of confetti with subtitles like "you did it" 
2018-03-20 10:42:27	gjabell	lol 
2018-03-20 10:42:34	gjabell	you should do that 
2018-03-20 10:42:35	jesse	or "sorry mario, but your princess is in another castle" 
2018-03-20 10:42:46	gjabell	make a honeypot with all that xD 
2018-03-20 10:43:21	jesse	If only people saw me as einstein and actually wanted into my stuff. 
2018-03-20 10:43:37	jesse	step 1: become einstein. 
2018-03-20 10:43:48	gjabell	I'm sure some random people in asia would be willing to take a crack 
2018-03-20 10:43:50	gjabell	or russia 
2018-03-20 10:44:13	gjabell	I had a server on digitalocean with fail2ban on it at one point, and I was getting 10-15 emails a day about people trying to break into it lol 
2018-03-20 10:44:37	jesse	what is fail2ban? 
2018-03-20 10:44:55	gjabell	it's a daemon that runs, watching the ssh logs for your server 
2018-03-20 10:45:18	gjabell	and if an ip fails to authenticate x number of times (which you can set), it adds a firewall rule to permanently block that ip from accessing anything 
2018-03-20 10:45:32	gjabell	so if people are trying to ssh into your server, it'll ban them if they can't authenticate 
2018-03-20 10:45:43	gjabell	basically just prevents brute force attacks 
2018-03-20 10:45:54	gjabell	which is kind of irrelevant if you are using ssh keys, but still 
2018-03-20 10:48:04	jesse	Hahaha my brother would have me banned then xD sometimes I'll change his wallpaper, or have recursively linked empty porn directories like in XKCD... But its okay, cuz he gave me permission.  
2018-03-20 10:50:09	gjabell	lol xD 
2018-03-20 10:50:17	gjabell	I accidentally banned myself once lol 
2018-03-20 10:50:32	jesse	What?! Thats awesome!! 
2018-03-20 10:53:05	gjabell	yeah, I was trying out a 2fa thing and it didn't work well, so when I went to ssh in again, it had blocked me xD 
2018-03-20 10:53:17	gjabell	I had to go to the digitalocean console and delete my ip from iptables lol 
2018-03-20 10:53:29	gjabell	I was really confused at first, before I realized what had happened 
2018-03-20 10:57:52	jesse	Sounds like that digitalocean console is a big security risk... 
2018-03-20 10:58:13	jesse	better patch that up galen.  
2018-03-20 10:58:19	gjabell	lol xD 
2018-03-20 10:58:22	gjabell	2fa ftw 
2018-03-20 14:23:33	gjabell	do you know what your team got on the plm project? 
2018-03-20 14:26:33	jesse	90. 
2018-03-20 14:26:37	jesse	you? 
2018-03-20 14:27:11	gjabell	80 
2018-03-20 14:27:28	gjabell	we went and talked with him about it bc we thought it was from us using gitlab even though we were given permission to use it 
2018-03-20 14:28:01	gjabell	but apparently it's because ours was 'just a project' and some teams 'deserved more points' 
2018-03-20 14:28:32	gjabell	which is fair, but since we gave him what the instructions asked for it seems a bit unfair to dock points from teams that didn't do as much as other teams rather than giving those teams extra points or something 
2018-03-20 14:28:33	gjabell	idk 
2018-03-20 14:28:50	jesse	ah i gotcha. we got points off cuz we didnt implement an FSM. even though the teacher just said to implement the card games "in any way that works" 
2018-03-20 14:29:09	gjabell	ok, so effectively the same reason we lost points 
2018-03-20 14:29:18	gjabell	that strikes me as a bit bs 
2018-03-20 14:30:49	jesse	I agree, but ya have to remember how little grades actually matter. No matter what we do, we will pass this class and graduate. Beyond that, if a company rejects me on the basis of gpa, I wouldn't want to work for them anyway. 
2018-03-20 14:30:59	gjabell	that's true 
2018-03-20 14:31:55	jesse	Besides, knowing us, we'll probably setup our own personal labs if we get bored working a standard programming job xD 
2018-03-20 14:32:21	gjabell	lol xD 
2018-03-20 14:32:24	gjabell	you know it 
2018-03-20 14:32:34	jesse	you've basically already got one. Your living room xD 
2018-03-20 14:32:49	gjabell	lol 
2018-03-20 14:32:57	gjabell	I actually just sold everything on sunday :P 
2018-03-20 14:33:39	jesse	you'll get bored eventually and buy it back... or something better... 
2018-03-20 14:33:55	jesse	your servers? 
2018-03-20 14:34:04	gjabell	yeah xD 
2018-03-20 14:34:13	gjabell	but I already bought of bunch of stuff for a white box build so we good lol 
2018-03-20 14:34:36	gjabell	I love the enterprise gear but moving it was going to be such a pain 
2018-03-20 14:34:43	jesse	haha whats it mean to be a whitebox build? you build it yourself? 
2018-03-20 14:34:50	gjabell	so I just put it up on craigslist on the offchance someone wanted it, and they did lol 
2018-03-20 14:35:00	gjabell	yeah, basically just custom built server in a normal computer case 
2018-03-20 14:37:20	jesse	my laptops host name is whitebox and my raspberry pi is blackbox... since I am a lot closer understanding to the software to my arch linux os than I am on the standard raspberry pi os. 
2018-03-20 14:37:29	gjabell	lol xD 
2018-03-20 14:37:31	gjabell	that's pretty great 
2018-03-20 14:38:38	jesse	I saw some servers on System76's webpage that were the size of a raspberry pi but a ton better. If you're looking for portability, you should check those out. 
2018-03-20 14:38:52	jesse	They are a lil expensive though 
2018-03-20 14:39:04	jesse	I think they call them 'Meerkats' or something 
2018-03-20 14:39:12	gjabell	huh 
2018-03-20 14:40:09	jesse	https://system76.com/desktops/meerkat
2018-03-20 14:40:09		Meerkat
2018-03-20 14:40:09		Adorns your desk without consuming it. Small but fierce, Meerkat is the perfect combination of performance and efficiency. System76 desktop computers are custom-built to run Ubuntu flawlessly. 
2018-03-20 14:41:15	jesse	I think they advertise it more like a desktop, but I think it would act more functionally like a linux server...  
2018-03-20 14:41:19	gjabell	that's neat 
2018-03-20 14:57:50	gjabell	gogs is advertised as being able to run on a rasp pi btw, so if you end up going with a git host that seems like the way to go xD 
2018-03-20 14:59:13	jesse	thanks for letting me know!  it may be the first semiuseful use for my raspberry pi xD 
2018-03-20 15:00:45	gjabell	xD 
2018-03-20 15:00:54	gjabell	I haven't tried gogs yet but the interface looks pretty nice 
2018-03-20 15:02:20	jesse	something else I think would be useful, is if I got some nixie tubes (cuz theyre stylish), and hook it up in a way so that those tubes act as a physical progress bar  or timer for my super long scripts. 
2018-03-20 15:03:09	gjabell	that would be neat 
2018-03-20 15:03:12	gjabell	what are nixie tubes? 
2018-03-20 15:04:07	jesse	just google it. it was used before digital displays... kinda like neon signs but cool and orange 
2018-03-20 15:04:41	gjabell	that's fucking cool 
2018-03-20 15:04:45	gjabell	you should totally get some of those 
2018-03-20 15:04:48	jesse	right?!?! 
2018-03-20 15:05:22	gjabell	now I want some 
2018-03-20 15:05:29	gjabell	even though I have no idea what I'd use them for xD 
2018-03-20 15:05:47	jesse	xD even a clock would look super cool 
2018-03-20 15:06:01	gjabell	yeah 
2018-03-20 15:07:16	jesse	if im gonna do something like that, I should probably do it while im at state, cuz ill probably need a 3d printer 
2018-03-20 15:07:39	gjabell	hmm yeah 
2018-03-20 16:43:40	jesse	prof seems overly excited about projects that averaged at 80% xD 
2018-03-20 16:44:00	gjabell	lol yea xD 
2018-03-21 14:48:58	jesse	@jesse uploaded a file: https://sturgill-operators.slack.com/files/U3VPX29FW/F9TNYHJLB/img8611960849298959685.jpg (Slack for Android Upload) 
2018-03-21 14:49:28	jesse	because i want you to lose points on not having a cheesy narrative. 
2018-03-21 14:49:32	jesse	xD 
2018-03-21 14:57:58	gjabell	XD 
2018-03-21 20:56:35	gjabell	you're taking the 12 o'clock senior design with king, right? 
2018-03-21 21:03:04	jesse	i think so. but i think it conflicts with the time my research meeting typically meets so Im not entirely sure. 
2018-03-21 21:05:28	gjabell	Ah, ok 
2018-03-21 21:11:52	jesse	i think no matter what, the section will be during my research meeting, so I dont think ill change it. Id prefer king over heckman anyway. 
2018-03-21 21:13:13	jesse	nevermind its actually a different class blocking my research. 
2018-03-21 21:18:59	gjabell	Yeah 
2018-03-21 21:19:03	gjabell	Ah, rip 
2018-03-21 21:20:33	jesse	yeah. I was actually planning on dropping one of my csc restricted electives to do my research for credit so my schedule could still work. unfortunately, it would mean I wouldnt be able to take software security... which would be a bummer to me. 
2018-03-21 21:21:06	gjabell	Ah
2018-03-21 21:21:06		Yeah that's annoying 
2018-03-22 11:08:47	jesse	https://github.com/piotrmurach/github_cli
2018-03-22 11:08:47		piotrmurach/github_cli
2018-03-22 11:08:47		github_cli - CLI-based access to GitHub API v3 
2018-03-22 11:09:27	jesse	I was looking for a way to view git issues in the terminal and I think i found it. 
2018-03-22 11:10:18	gjabell	Yo 
2018-03-22 11:10:22	gjabell	That's neat 
2018-03-22 12:28:09	jesse	I actually couldn't get it to install using gem. rather, it installed but couldn't run. 
2018-03-22 12:28:26	gjabell	Rip 
2018-03-22 12:29:15	jesse	I'll find a way lol... after I stop procrastinating on my game log 
2018-03-22 12:29:31	gjabell	XD 
2018-03-22 12:29:39	gjabell	I haven't even started lol 
2018-03-22 12:30:34	jesse	nice. unfortunately playing through a story game more than once and recording all your choices/decisions takes a ton of time. 
2018-03-22 12:38:18	gjabell	Yeah 
2018-03-22 12:38:29	gjabell	I'm just going to do the Stanley parable 
2018-03-22 12:39:24	jesse	I'm not sure what that is, but if you're using 'just' to describe it, then it sounds like a good choice... depression quest is kinda long. 
2018-03-22 12:43:13	gjabell	XD yeah the play through are pretty short 
2018-03-22 12:45:21	gjabell	Also idk if you have figured out summer housing yet, but I found out yesterday that they'll let people stay in WR even if they aren't doing summer school

2018-03-22 12:48:43		That's fair
2018-03-22 12:48:43		If you decide to go with WR let me know and I'll add you as a preferred roommate if you want 
2018-03-22 13:05:26	jesse	Thanks, I probably won't though. If my brother doesn't want me taking his room, I'll definitely message you though.  
2018-03-22 13:05:39	jesse	Did housing for summer open up? 
2018-03-22 13:05:49	jesse	or has it been up? 
2018-03-22 13:13:27	gjabell	Sounds good
2018-03-22 13:13:27		Idk, they just made it an option so 
2018-03-22 15:12:30	jesse	do you know how long your going to make your game log? its gonna be structured differently than what we're used to. 
2018-03-22 15:13:35	gjabell	I honestly haven't looked into it much 
2018-03-22 15:14:00	gjabell	If there aren't any length requirements I'll just make it as little as possible while still answering the questions xD 
2018-03-22 15:15:19	jesse	yeah im thinking Ill just answer the questions and be done. it just concerns me that theyre using the word "essay" to describe the log. essay makes me think 12 pages xD 
2018-03-22 15:15:49	jesse	that diagram i made was a nightmare 
2018-03-22 15:16:52	gjabell	lol 
2018-03-22 15:18:06	gjabell	idk, it seems like it should be about as much content as the last game logs, including the diagram 
2018-03-22 15:18:09	jesse	plant uml helped but i had to split it into 5 pages/ 5 different diagrams 
2018-03-22 15:18:20	gjabell	so if the diagram has content then you probably don't need as much writing 
2018-03-22 15:18:22	gjabell	lol 
2018-03-22 15:18:26	gjabell	plant uml ftw 
2018-03-22 16:59:31	jesse	I made it so I can type tab anywhere on the current line and tab the whole line across :) . 
2018-03-22 17:00:41	jesse	and untabbing works too  
2018-03-22 17:35:11	gjabell	Bruh 
2018-03-22 17:35:15	gjabell	That's sweet@ 
2018-03-22 17:36:16	jesse	i can give you the lines in my vimrc, but you probably know how to do it. 
2018-03-22 17:36:54	jesse	map <Tab> :s/^/    <CR> 
2018-03-22 17:36:54	jesse	map <S-Tab> :s/^    /<CR> 
2018-03-22 17:37:09	gjabell	I actually don't know much about vimscript, so thanks xD 
2018-03-22 17:37:33	jesse	works in visual mode too. just highlight the lines you wanna change the indentation to. 
2018-03-22 17:37:59	jesse	those are the only two lines I use :) 
2018-03-22 17:43:50	gjabell	Neat 
2018-03-22 17:44:29	gjabell	mine is super long bc I just grabbed a bunch of stuff from other ones I've seen xD 
2018-03-22 17:44:41	gjabell	I've been slowly getting use to using the different plugins tho 
2018-03-22 17:44:45	gjabell	some of them are super nice 
2018-03-22 17:45:17	jesse	the only bad thing is that the selected text goes away. If you wanted to indent more than once, you have to highlight again. However, if you need to un-indent multiple times, you should probably refactor xD 
2018-03-22 17:45:28	gjabell	ah 
2018-03-22 17:45:29	gjabell	yeah xD 
2018-03-22 18:08:26	jesse	do you think 1.7 pages of text .7 pages of 2 small pictures  and 5 pages of a giant flowchart is good enough for this game log? 
2018-03-22 18:08:43	gjabell	Probably yeah 
2018-03-22 18:08:50	gjabell	They're pretty lenient on grading 
2018-03-23 09:30:18	jesse	hey galen, I  deactivated my facebook,  and i still have messenger.... although I dont have any way to check if my account was deactivated or not cuz if I try to sign in, it will activate my account... 
2018-03-23 09:30:51	gjabell	XD
2018-03-23 09:30:51		That's sweet 
2018-03-23 09:31:04	gjabell	Is there a difference between deactivating and deleting? 
2018-03-23 09:42:21	jesse	i think deactivating prevents users from accessing my data, but they can still do things like tag me or invite me to events. with deactivation, facebook still has their talons in my privacy xD... but if I had deleted, I dont think I would be able to use messenger without setting  up all of my contacts and groups again. 
2018-03-23 09:43:28	gjabell	ah, ok 
2018-03-23 09:43:49	gjabell	I would prefer to just not use messenger lol 
2018-03-23 09:43:58	gjabell	but unf not everyone is a comp sci person xD 
2018-03-23 09:44:41	jesse	it's only comp sci ppl using messenger for me. 
2018-03-23 09:45:11	jesse	don't they know that BBS is the way of the future?! 
2018-03-23 09:45:54	gjabell	lol 
2018-03-23 09:46:00	gjabell	what's BBS? 
2018-03-23 09:47:56	jesse	bulletin board systems. it was used back when you had to connect through phonelines to access a forum. a town forum would cost a lil extra to your phone bill, but all around the nation or world would be like making phone calls on a cruise. 
2018-03-23 09:48:31	gjabell	ah 
2018-03-23 09:48:55	gjabell	why aren't we still using that, I mean come on 
2018-03-23 09:49:18	gjabell	we could be sending messages through the phone lines and instead we use slack? 
2018-03-23 09:49:19	gjabell	smh 
2018-03-23 09:49:39	jesse	what is smh? 
2018-03-23 09:49:57	gjabell	shake(s) my head 
2018-03-23 09:52:45	jesse	ahh xD. ya know there's this strange new communications protocol where I can send and receive data through vibrating the air molecules. It uses up no wifi, no cellular data, and its ultra secure. 
2018-03-23 09:53:05	jesse	it's revolutionary 
2018-03-23 09:53:26	gjabell	is it morse code 
2018-03-23 09:53:42	jesse	xD even better... talking 
2018-03-23 09:53:52	gjabell	xD 
2018-03-23 09:54:49	gjabell	ofc if you really want it to be secure, you need to utilize a public/private key exchange to properly encryp the conversation 
2018-03-23 09:56:04	jesse	alcohol is a good way to encrypt data 
2018-03-23 09:56:40	gjabell	lol xD 
2018-03-23 10:17:19	jesse	btw, can you spy on my facebook account? xD 
2018-03-23 10:35:12	gjabell	like just go to it? 
2018-03-23 10:36:08	gjabell	yeah pretty sure it's invisible now 
2018-03-23 10:36:23	gjabell	I can't search for it through the default interface or my friends list 
2018-03-23 10:36:44	gjabell	looks like I can' 
2018-03-23 10:36:48	gjabell	t even tag you 
2018-03-23 10:39:30	jesse	alright. That's good enough for me xD. I'm not much of a privacy nut, I'd honestly just rather people not contact me if they are out of my life. 
2018-03-23 10:39:32	jesse	Thanks 
2018-03-23 10:39:37	gjabell	yeah that's fair 
2018-03-23 10:39:43	gjabell	kinda want to do that on mine too lol 
2018-03-23 10:40:07	gjabell	although I don't even use facebook most of the time so idk if there's anything I care about people seeing on it xD 
2018-03-23 10:40:48	jesse	Do it. I'll activate my facebook to check if your facebook account has been deactivated... but then youll have to activate your fb account to check if my account is deactivated...  
2018-03-23 10:41:05	gjabell	hmm... 
2018-03-23 10:41:27	gjabell	how do you even do it 
2018-03-23 10:42:10	jesse	Account Settings > General > Account Settings I think 
2018-03-23 10:42:17	jesse	wait... 
2018-03-23 10:42:21	gjabell	ah 
2018-03-23 10:42:22	jesse	i got that messed up haha 
2018-03-23 10:42:23	gjabell	manage account 
2018-03-23 10:44:36	gjabell	sayonara facebook 
2018-03-23 10:45:41	jesse	Stallman still doesn't approve unless we harass them to delete all of our data off their database. xD 
2018-03-23 10:46:00	gjabell	what the shit 
2018-03-23 10:46:21	gjabell	it forced me to log back into messenger and that reactivated facebook 
2018-03-23 10:46:39	gjabell	god dammit 
2018-03-23 10:46:46	jesse	Oh, theres an option below log-back-in where you just input your phone number 
2018-03-23 10:46:47	gjabell	I guess it's only messenger and not messenger lite that works 
2018-03-23 10:47:14	gjabell	which blows, because messenger sucks cock 
2018-03-23 10:48:52	gjabell	which interestingly probably tells us that the messenger lite app is just a wrapper around their web ui 
2018-03-23 10:50:11	jesse	nah theres a place you can just put in your phone number and it logs you in as if you had a facebook account.. your deactivated fb account may need your phone number. idk 
2018-03-23 10:50:29	gjabell	that's what I did on lite 
2018-03-23 10:50:33	gjabell	are you using lite or default? 
2018-03-23 10:51:14	jesse	the regular one 
2018-03-23 10:51:22	jesse	ill download lite to check it 
2018-03-23 10:52:25	jesse	it doesn't look like lite has those options. 
2018-03-23 10:52:29	gjabell	fuck me, did it again 
2018-03-23 10:52:45	gjabell	where is the option? 
2018-03-23 10:52:52	jesse	on the regular one? 
2018-03-23 10:52:59	gjabell	yea 
2018-03-23 10:54:09	jesse	ill look into it. im gonna reinstall the regular one. 
2018-03-23 10:54:17	gjabell	k 
2018-03-23 10:57:29	jesse	So when I did it, it showed up a popup that said I could continue using messenger without my facebook account. I can head over to your apartment to show/help ya if ya want. 
2018-03-23 10:57:48	gjabell	hmm 
2018-03-23 10:57:52	gjabell	sure, why not xD 
2018-03-23 10:58:02	gjabell	let me brush my teeth first tho, give me 5 or so 
2018-03-23 10:59:06	jesse	Same. 
2018-03-24 11:28:01		getting channel history...
2018-03-21 21:19:03	gjabell	Ah, rip 
2018-03-21 21:20:33	jesse	yeah. I was actually planning on dropping one of my csc restricted electives to do my research for credit so my schedule could still work. unfortunately, it would mean I wouldnt be able to take software security... which would be a bummer to me. 
2018-03-21 21:21:06	gjabell	Ah
2018-03-21 21:21:06		Yeah that's annoying 
2018-03-22 11:08:47	jesse	https://github.com/piotrmurach/github_cli
2018-03-22 11:08:47		piotrmurach/github_cli
2018-03-22 11:08:47		github_cli - CLI-based access to GitHub API v3 
2018-03-22 11:09:27	jesse	I was looking for a way to view git issues in the terminal and I think i found it. 
2018-03-22 11:10:18	gjabell	Yo 
2018-03-22 11:10:22	gjabell	That's neat 
2018-03-22 12:28:09	jesse	I actually couldn't get it to install using gem. rather, it installed but couldn't run. 
2018-03-22 12:28:26	gjabell	Rip 
2018-03-22 12:29:15	jesse	I'll find a way lol... after I stop procrastinating on my game log 
2018-03-22 12:29:31	gjabell	XD 
2018-03-22 12:29:39	gjabell	I haven't even started lol 
2018-03-22 12:30:34	jesse	nice. unfortunately playing through a story game more than once and recording all your choices/decisions takes a ton of time. 
2018-03-22 12:38:18	gjabell	Yeah 
2018-03-22 12:38:29	gjabell	I'm just going to do the Stanley parable 
2018-03-22 12:39:24	jesse	I'm not sure what that is, but if you're using 'just' to describe it, then it sounds like a good choice... depression quest is kinda long. 
2018-03-22 12:43:13	gjabell	XD yeah the play through are pretty short 
2018-03-22 12:45:21	gjabell	Also idk if you have figured out summer housing yet, but I found out yesterday that they'll let people stay in WR even if they aren't doing summer school 
2018-03-22 12:47:34	jesse	wow really? when they emailed me a month ago, they said the opposite. I think I'm gonna be staying at my brother's place, but I don't really like that plan (other than not having to pay). 
2018-03-22 12:48:43	gjabell	Yeah I know, they just changed their minds xD
2018-03-22 12:48:43		That's fair
2018-03-22 12:48:43		If you decide to go with WR let me know and I'll add you as a preferred roommate if you want

2018-03-23 10:36:48	gjabell	t even tag you 
2018-03-23 10:39:30	jesse	alright. That's good enough for me xD. I'm not much of a privacy nut, I'd honestly just rather people not contact me if they are out of my life. 
2018-03-23 10:39:32	jesse	Thanks 
2018-03-23 10:39:37	gjabell	yeah that's fair 
2018-03-23 10:39:43	gjabell	kinda want to do that on mine too lol 
2018-03-23 10:40:07	gjabell	although I don't even use facebook most of the time so idk if there's anything I care about people seeing on it xD 
2018-03-23 10:40:48	jesse	Do it. I'll activate my facebook to check if your facebook account has been deactivated... but then youll have to activate your fb account to check if my account is deactivated...  
2018-03-23 10:41:05	gjabell	hmm... 
2018-03-23 10:41:27	gjabell	how do you even do it 
2018-03-23 10:42:10	jesse	Account Settings > General > Account Settings I think 
2018-03-23 10:42:17	jesse	wait... 
2018-03-23 10:42:21	gjabell	ah 
2018-03-23 10:42:22	jesse	i got that messed up haha 
2018-03-23 10:42:23	gjabell	manage account 
2018-03-23 10:44:36	gjabell	sayonara facebook 
2018-03-23 10:45:41	jesse	Stallman still doesn't approve unless we harass them to delete all of our data off their database. xD 
2018-03-23 10:46:00	gjabell	what the shit 
2018-03-23 10:46:21	gjabell	it forced me to log back into messenger and that reactivated facebook 
2018-03-23 10:46:39	gjabell	god dammit 
2018-03-23 10:46:46	jesse	Oh, theres an option below log-back-in where you just input your phone number 
2018-03-23 10:46:47	gjabell	I guess it's only messenger and not messenger lite that works 
2018-03-23 10:47:14	gjabell	which blows, because messenger sucks cock 
2018-03-23 10:48:52	gjabell	which interestingly probably tells us that the messenger lite app is just a wrapper around their web ui 
2018-03-23 10:50:11	jesse	nah theres a place you can just put in your phone number and it logs you in as if you had a facebook account.. your deactivated fb account may need your phone number. idk 
2018-03-23 10:50:29	gjabell	that's what I did on lite 
2018-03-23 10:50:33	gjabell	are you using lite or default? 
2018-03-23 10:51:14	jesse	the regular one 
2018-03-23 10:51:22	jesse	ill download lite to check it 
2018-03-23 10:52:25	jesse	it doesn't look like lite has those options. 
2018-03-23 10:52:29	gjabell	fuck me, did it again 
2018-03-23 10:52:45	gjabell	where is the option? 
2018-03-23 10:52:52	jesse	on the regular one? 
2018-03-23 10:52:59	gjabell	yea 
2018-03-23 10:54:09	jesse	ill look into it. im gonna reinstall the regular one. 
2018-03-23 10:54:17	gjabell	k 
2018-03-23 10:57:29	jesse	So when I did it, it showed up a popup that said I could continue using messenger without my facebook account. I can head over to your apartment to show/help ya if ya want. 
2018-03-23 10:57:48	gjabell	hmm 
2018-03-23 10:57:52	gjabell	sure, why not xD 
2018-03-23 10:58:02	gjabell	let me brush my teeth first tho, give me 5 or so 
2018-03-23 10:59:06	jesse	Same. 
2018-03-23 10:59:28	gjabell	oh 
2018-03-23 10:59:35	gjabell	there we go, I got the message too 
2018-03-23 10:59:39	gjabell	weird that I didn't get it before 
2018-03-23 11:07:36	jesse	still want me to come over or nah? 
2018-03-23 11:07:55	gjabell	up to you, I'm always down to chat about random computer stuff xD 
2018-03-23 11:08:25	gjabell	I have to go sell someone a mobo around 1140 tho so unless you're really bored and want to come with we won't be able to hang out for very long lol 
2018-03-23 11:09:01	gjabell	actually might be more like 1130, cause I need gas too 
2018-03-23 11:09:54	jesse	what's a mobo? 
2018-03-23 11:09:58	gjabell	motherboard 
2018-03-23 11:10:04	gjabell	for a computer 
2018-03-23 11:10:22	jesse	lol i know what motherboards are for haha 
2018-03-23 11:10:27	gjabell	ok just makign sure xD 
2018-03-23 11:11:16	gjabell	then I'm buying some ram, so I cna complete my server xD 
2018-03-23 11:12:18	jesse	I'm probably gonna go to the grocery store with my roommate around 12. maybe ill visit later today. 
2018-03-23 11:12:36	gjabell	sounds like a plan 
2018-03-23 11:12:47	gjabell	I'll hopefully be back here around 1 or so 
2018-03-23 11:13:34	jesse	same 
2018-03-23 13:18:38	jesse	i think they have free chipoltle either on the oval or at the cistern. are you going to that? 
2018-03-23 13:19:21	gjabell	Prollt not lol, wanna get the server up and running xD 
2018-03-23 13:19:29	jesse	XD 
2018-03-23 14:10:19	jesse	still workin on your server? 
2018-03-23 14:11:20	gjabell	Yep 
2018-03-23 14:11:26	gjabell	It isn't started, which is bad lol 
2018-03-23 14:11:43	jesse	want some help? I'm pretty bored 
2018-03-23 14:12:01	jesse	I'm not knowledgble in servrs tho 
2018-03-23 14:12:21	gjabell	I actually have to go to a doctors appointment in about 15 min but you're welcome to come by afterwards 
2018-03-23 14:12:41	jesse	oki. whats the doctors appointment for? 
2018-03-23 14:12:53	gjabell	It's a post op for my eye lol 
2018-03-23 14:13:03	gjabell	Like a 3 month checkup thing 
2018-03-23 14:13:19	jesse	what did you to your eye? 
2018-03-23 14:13:30	jesse	what was the op? 
2018-03-23 14:14:11	gjabell	I had a small surgery done back in december 
2018-03-23 14:14:17	gjabell	For keratakonus 
2018-03-23 14:16:01	gjabell	Well, server finally turned on, which is good BC it hopefully means everything I'd OK xD but idk why it wasn't working before lol 
2018-03-23 14:16:45	jesse	keratakonus sounds bad. 
2018-03-23 14:17:12	gjabell	I'll explain it when I get back xD
2018-03-23 14:17:12		It sounds worse than it is haha 
2018-03-23 14:17:18	jesse	ok 
2018-03-23 14:17:23	jesse	is it rare? 
2018-03-23 14:17:55	gjabell	About 1 in 10000 I think 
2018-03-23 14:18:21	jesse	i wonder if itll show up on the website my research is making 
2018-03-23 14:19:56	jesse	unless you spelled it wrong, it is not on our webpage :( 
2018-03-23 14:20:56	gjabell	It's entirely possible I did
2018-03-23 14:20:56		Although I'd be pretty surprised if it were xD 
2018-03-23 14:39:18	jesse	actually we do have stuff on that disease. or at least, maybe rarer forms of that disease 
2018-03-23 14:40:14	gjabell	Lol 
2018-03-23 15:50:50	jesse	did ya get back from your eye doc? 
2018-03-23 15:51:10	gjabell	Still waiting for them to see me :( (no pun intended) 
2018-03-23 15:51:31	gjabell	It's in Durham too, so I'll probably be back around 5 or maybe 530 
2018-03-23 15:51:38	gjabell	Depending how long I have to wait 
2018-03-23 15:52:50	jesse	xD thats a good  intended pun 
2018-03-23 18:22:06	gjabell	Whelp, I have finally returned, after a long and arduous process xD 
2018-03-23 18:22:52	jesse	that sounds awful.  how the heck did that take 4 hours?! 
2018-03-23 18:23:55	gjabell	They were slow and it took me an hour to get back :( 
2018-03-23 18:24:00	gjabell	It was in durham 
2018-03-23 18:24:43	jesse	that really sucks dude. I've been messing with my raspberry pi and playing the 2nd south park game xD 
2018-03-23 18:24:53	gjabell	XD nice 
2018-03-23 18:25:08	gjabell	Now I finally get to get the server running lol 
2018-03-23 18:25:30	jesse	its pretty hard to ssh into it without the ethernet.
2018-03-23 18:25:30		can I see??!! 
2018-03-23 18:25:55	gjabell	Hmm yeah I'd imagine so xD 
2018-03-23 18:26:14	gjabell	Sure, I need to go grab a package from tower, I can meet you if you want 
2018-03-23 18:26:34	jesse	yea sure 
2018-03-23 18:26:40	gjabell	Kk 
2018-03-23 20:37:20	jesse	hey Galen, there was one more thing i forgot to ask, do you remember what you proposed in English 331 for the final essay thing? 
2018-03-23 20:37:52	gjabell	yeah, it was an android app for a fake garmin product xD 
2018-03-23 20:40:28	jesse	lol nice. I wanted to do propose something related to my research job, so I dont have to make up a scenario... but I wouldnt know what. maybe some feature for the webpage or something. 
2018-03-23 20:40:48	jesse	maybe the insurance function that I cringed about. 
2018-03-23 20:41:00	gjabell	could be 
2018-03-23 20:41:06	gjabell	it can be fairly small, whatever it is 
2018-03-23 20:41:13	gjabell	as long as you can go into detail about it 
2018-03-23 20:41:30	gjabell	I originally was going to go with a whole home automation system thing and she was like 'that's way too much' 
2018-03-23 20:41:41	gjabell	so I just pretended I was going to make an app for interacting with it instead 
2018-03-23 20:41:56	gjabell	and just went into a lot of detail in terms of the backend, database, frontend, etc. 
2018-03-23 20:42:39	jesse	lol but she wouldn't know if it's too much 
2018-03-23 20:43:07	gjabell	right, but the nice thing about doing comp sci stuff is that yoiu can basically make up bs and she won't know the difference 
2018-03-23 20:43:28	jesse	true. 
2018-03-24 16:45:52		getting channel history...
2018-03-22 11:10:22	gjabell	That's neat 
2018-03-22 12:28:09	jesse	I actually couldn't get it to install using gem. rather, it installed but couldn't run. 
2018-03-22 12:28:26	gjabell	Rip 
2018-03-22 12:29:15	jesse	I'll find a way lol... after I stop procrastinating on my game log 
2018-03-22 12:29:31	gjabell	XD 
2018-03-22 12:29:39	gjabell	I haven't even started lol 
2018-03-22 12:30:34	jesse	nice. unfortunately playing through a story game more than once and recording all your choices/decisions takes a ton of time. 
2018-03-22 12:38:18	gjabell	Yeah 
2018-03-22 12:38:29	gjabell	I'm just going to do the Stanley parable 
2018-03-22 12:39:24	jesse	I'm not sure what that is, but if you're using 'just' to describe it, then it sounds like a good choice... depression quest is kinda long. 
2018-03-22 12:43:13	gjabell	XD yeah the play through are pretty short 
2018-03-22 12:45:21	gjabell	Also idk if you have figured out summer housing yet, but I found out yesterday that they'll let people stay in WR even if they aren't doing summer school 
2018-03-22 12:47:34	jesse	wow really? when they emailed me a month ago, they said the opposite. I think I'm gonna be staying at my brother's place, but I don't really like that plan (other than not having to pay). 
2018-03-22 12:48:43	gjabell	Yeah I know, they just changed their minds xD
2018-03-22 12:48:43		That's fair
2018-03-22 12:48:43		If you decide to go with WR let me know and I'll add you as a preferred roommate if you want 
2018-03-22 13:05:26	jesse	Thanks, I probably won't though. If my brother doesn't want me taking his room, I'll definitely message you though.  
2018-03-22 13:05:39	jesse	Did housing for summer open up? 
2018-03-22 13:05:49	jesse	or has it been up? 
2018-03-22 13:13:27	gjabell	Sounds good
2018-03-22 13:13:27		Idk, they just made it an option so 
2018-03-22 15:12:30	jesse	do you know how long your going to make your game log? its gonna be structured differently than what we're used to. 
2018-03-22 15:13:35	gjabell	I honestly haven't looked into it much 
2018-03-22 15:14:00	gjabell	If there aren't any length requirements I'll just make it as little as possible while still answering the questions xD 
2018-03-22 15:15:19	jesse	yeah im thinking Ill just answer the questions and be done. it just concerns me that theyre using the word "essay" to describe the log. essay makes me think 12 pages xD 
2018-03-22 15:15:49	jesse	that diagram i made was a nightmare 
2018-03-22 15:16:52	gjabell	lol 
2018-03-22 15:18:06	gjabell	idk, it seems like it should be about as much content as the last game logs, including the diagram 
2018-03-22 15:18:09	jesse	plant uml helped but i had to split it into 5 pages/ 5 different diagrams 
2018-03-22 15:18:20	gjabell	so if the diagram has content then you probably don't need as much writing 
2018-03-22 15:18:22	gjabell	lol 
2018-03-22 15:18:26	gjabell	plant uml ftw 
2018-03-22 16:59:31	jesse	I made it so I can type tab anywhere on the current line and tab the whole line across :) . 
2018-03-22 17:00:41	jesse	and untabbing works too  
2018-03-22 17:35:11	gjabell	Bruh 
2018-03-22 17:35:15	gjabell	That's sweet@ 
2018-03-22 17:36:16	jesse	i can give you the lines in my vimrc, but you probably know how to do it. 
2018-03-22 17:36:54	jesse	map <Tab> :s/^/    <CR> 
2018-03-22 17:36:54	jesse	map <S-Tab> :s/^    /<CR> 
2018-03-22 17:37:09	gjabell	I actually don't know much about vimscript, so thanks xD 
2018-03-22 17:37:33	jesse	works in visual mode too. just highlight the lines you wanna change the indentation to. 
2018-03-22 17:37:59	jesse	those are the only two lines I use :) 
2018-03-22 17:43:50	gjabell	Neat 
2018-03-22 17:44:29	gjabell	mine is super long bc I just grabbed a bunch of stuff from other ones I've seen xD 
2018-03-22 17:44:41	gjabell	I've been slowly getting use to using the different plugins tho 
2018-03-22 17:44:45	gjabell	some of them are super nice 
2018-03-22 17:45:17	jesse	the only bad thing is that the selected text goes away. If you wanted to indent more than once, you have to highlight again. However, if you need to un-indent multiple times, you should probably refactor xD 
2018-03-22 17:45:28	gjabell	ah 
2018-03-22 17:45:29	gjabell	yeah xD 
2018-03-22 18:08:26	jesse	do you think 1.7 pages of text .7 pages of 2 small pictures  and 5 pages of a giant flowchart is good enough for this game log? 
2018-03-22 18:08:43	gjabell	Probably yeah 
2018-03-22 18:08:50	gjabell	They're pretty lenient on grading 
2018-03-23 09:30:18	jesse	hey galen, I  deactivated my facebook,  and i still have messenger.... although I dont have any way to check if my account was deactivated or not cuz if I try to sign in, it will activate my account... 
2018-03-23 09:30:51	gjabell	XD
2018-03-23 09:30:51		That's sweet 
2018-03-23 09:31:04	gjabell	Is there a difference between deactivating and deleting? 
2018-03-23 09:42:21	jesse	i think deactivating prevents users from accessing my data, but they can still do things like tag me or invite me to events. with deactivation, facebook still has their talons in my privacy xD... but if I had deleted, I dont think I would be able to use messenger without setting  up all of my contacts and groups again. 
2018-03-23 09:43:28	gjabell	ah, ok 
2018-03-23 09:43:49	gjabell	I would prefer to just not use messenger lol 
2018-03-23 09:43:58	gjabell	but unf not everyone is a comp sci person xD 
2018-03-23 09:44:41	jesse	it's only comp sci ppl using messenger for me. 
2018-03-23 09:45:11	jesse	don't they know that BBS is the way of the future?! 
2018-03-23 09:45:54	gjabell	lol 
2018-03-23 09:46:00	gjabell	what's BBS? 
2018-03-23 09:47:56	jesse	bulletin board systems. it was used back when you had to connect through phonelines to access a forum. a town forum would cost a lil extra to your phone bill, but all around the nation or world would be like making phone calls on a cruise. 
2018-03-23 09:48:31	gjabell	ah 
2018-03-23 09:48:55	gjabell	why aren't we still using that, I mean come on 
2018-03-23 09:49:18	gjabell	we could be sending messages through the phone lines and instead we use slack? 
2018-03-23 09:49:19	gjabell	smh 
2018-03-23 09:49:39	jesse	what is smh? 
2018-03-23 09:49:57	gjabell	shake(s) my head 
2018-03-23 09:52:45	jesse	ahh xD. ya know there's this strange new communications protocol where I can send and receive data through vibrating the air molecules. It uses up no wifi, no cellular data, and its ultra secure. 
2018-03-23 09:53:05	jesse	it's revolutionary 
2018-03-23 09:53:26	gjabell	is it morse code 
2018-03-23 09:53:42	jesse	xD even better... talking 
2018-03-23 09:53:52	gjabell	xD 
2018-03-23 09:54:49	gjabell	ofc if you really want it to be secure, you need to utilize a public/private key exchange to properly encryp the conversation 
2018-03-23 09:56:04	jesse	alcohol is a good way to encrypt data 
2018-03-23 09:56:40	gjabell	lol xD 
2018-03-23 10:17:19	jesse	btw, can you spy on my facebook account? xD 
2018-03-23 10:35:12	gjabell	like just go to it? 
2018-03-23 10:36:08	gjabell	yeah pretty sure it's invisible now 
2018-03-23 10:36:23	gjabell	I can't search for it through the default interface or my friends list 
2018-03-23 10:36:44	gjabell	looks like I can' 
2018-03-23 10:36:48	gjabell	t even tag you 
2018-03-23 10:39:30	jesse	alright. That's good enough for me xD. I'm not much of a privacy nut, I'd honestly just rather people not contact me if they are out of my life. 
2018-03-23 10:39:32	jesse	Thanks 
2018-03-23 10:39:37	gjabell	yeah that's fair 
2018-03-23 10:39:43	gjabell	kinda want to do that on mine too lol 
2018-03-23 10:40:07	gjabell	although I don't even use facebook most of the time so idk if there's anything I care about people seeing on it xD 
2018-03-23 10:40:48	jesse	Do it. I'll activate my facebook to check if your facebook account has been deactivated... but then youll have to activate your fb account to check if my account is deactivated...  
2018-03-23 10:41:05	gjabell	hmm... 
2018-03-23 10:41:27	gjabell	how do you even do it 
2018-03-23 10:42:10	jesse	Account Settings > General > Account Settings I think 
2018-03-23 10:42:17	jesse	wait... 
2018-03-23 10:42:21	gjabell	ah 
2018-03-23 10:42:22	jesse	i got that messed up haha 
2018-03-23 10:42:23	gjabell	manage account 
2018-03-23 10:44:36	gjabell	sayonara facebook 
2018-03-23 10:45:41	jesse	Stallman still doesn't approve unless we harass them to delete all of our data off their database. xD 
2018-03-23 10:46:00	gjabell	what the shit 
2018-03-23 10:46:21	gjabell	it forced me to log back into messenger and that reactivated facebook 
2018-03-23 10:46:39	gjabell	god dammit 
2018-03-23 10:46:46	jesse	Oh, theres an option below log-back-in where you just input your phone number 
2018-03-23 10:46:47	gjabell	I guess it's only messenger and not messenger lite that works 
2018-03-23 10:47:14	gjabell	which blows, because messenger sucks cock 
2018-03-23 10:48:52	gjabell	which interestingly probably tells us that the messenger lite app is just a wrapper around their web ui 
2018-03-23 10:50:11	jesse	nah theres a place you can just put in your phone number and it logs you in as if you had a facebook account.. your deactivated fb account may need your phone number. idk 
2018-03-23 10:50:29	gjabell	that's what I did on lite 
2018-03-23 10:50:33	gjabell	are you using lite or default? 
2018-03-23 10:51:14	jesse	the regular one 
2018-03-23 10:51:22	jesse	ill download lite to check it 
2018-03-23 10:52:25	jesse	it doesn't look like lite has those options. 
2018-03-23 10:52:29	gjabell	fuck me, did it again 
2018-03-23 10:52:45	gjabell	where is the option? 
2018-03-23 10:52:52	jesse	on the regular one? 
2018-03-23 10:52:59	gjabell	yea 
2018-03-23 10:54:09	jesse	ill look into it. im gonna reinstall the regular one. 
2018-03-23 10:54:17	gjabell	k 
2018-03-23 10:57:29	jesse	So when I did it, it showed up a popup that said I could continue using messenger without my facebook account. I can head over to your apartment to show/help ya if ya want. 
2018-03-23 10:57:48	gjabell	hmm 
2018-03-23 10:57:52	gjabell	sure, why not xD 
2018-03-23 10:58:02	gjabell	let me brush my teeth first tho, give me 5 or so 
2018-03-23 10:59:06	jesse	Same. 
2018-03-23 10:59:28	gjabell	oh 
2018-03-23 10:59:35	gjabell	there we go, I got the message too 
2018-03-23 10:59:39	gjabell	weird that I didn't get it before 
2018-03-23 11:07:36	jesse	still want me to come over or nah? 
2018-03-23 11:07:55	gjabell	up to you, I'm always down to chat about random computer stuff xD 
2018-03-23 11:08:25	gjabell	I have to go sell someone a mobo around 1140 tho so unless you're really bored and want to come with we won't be able to hang out for very long lol 
2018-03-23 11:09:01	gjabell	actually might be more like 1130, cause I need gas too 
2018-03-23 11:09:54	jesse	what's a mobo? 
2018-03-23 11:09:58	gjabell	motherboard 
2018-03-23 11:10:04	gjabell	for a computer 
2018-03-23 11:10:22	jesse	lol i know what motherboards are for haha 
2018-03-23 11:10:27	gjabell	ok just makign sure xD 
2018-03-23 11:11:16	gjabell	then I'm buying some ram, so I cna complete my server xD 
2018-03-23 11:12:18	jesse	I'm probably gonna go to the grocery store with my roommate around 12. maybe ill visit later today. 
2018-03-23 11:12:36	gjabell	sounds like a plan 
2018-03-23 11:12:47	gjabell	I'll hopefully be back here around 1 or so 
2018-03-23 11:13:34	jesse	same 
2018-03-23 13:18:38	jesse	i think they have free chipoltle either on the oval or at the cistern. are you going to that? 
2018-03-23 13:19:21	gjabell	Prollt not lol, wanna get the server up and running xD 
2018-03-23 13:19:29	jesse	XD 
2018-03-23 14:10:19	jesse	still workin on your server? 
2018-03-23 14:11:20	gjabell	Yep 
2018-03-23 14:11:26	gjabell	It isn't started, which is bad lol 
2018-03-23 14:11:43	jesse	want some help? I'm pretty bored 
2018-03-23 14:12:01	jesse	I'm not knowledgble in servrs tho 
2018-03-23 14:12:21	gjabell	I actually have to go to a doctors appointment in about 15 min but you're welcome to come by afterwards 
2018-03-23 14:12:41	jesse	oki. whats the doctors appointment for? 
2018-03-23 14:12:53	gjabell	It's a post op for my eye lol 
2018-03-23 14:13:03	gjabell	Like a 3 month checkup thing 
2018-03-23 14:13:19	jesse	what did you to your eye? 
2018-03-23 14:13:30	jesse	what was the op? 
2018-03-23 14:14:11	gjabell	I had a small surgery done back in december 
2018-03-23 14:14:17	gjabell	For keratakonus 
2018-03-23 14:16:01	gjabell	Well, server finally turned on, which is good BC it hopefully means everything I'd OK xD but idk why it wasn't working before lol 
2018-03-23 14:16:45	jesse	keratakonus sounds bad. 
2018-03-23 14:17:12	gjabell	I'll explain it when I get back xD
2018-03-23 14:17:12		It sounds worse than it is haha 
2018-03-23 14:17:18	jesse	ok 
2018-03-23 14:17:23	jesse	is it rare? 
2018-03-23 14:17:55	gjabell	About 1 in 10000 I think 
2018-03-23 14:18:21	jesse	i wonder if itll show up on the website my research is making 
2018-03-23 14:19:56	jesse	unless you spelled it wrong, it is not on our webpage :( 
2018-03-23 14:20:56	gjabell	It's entirely possible I did
2018-03-23 14:20:56		Although I'd be pretty surprised if it were xD 
2018-03-23 14:39:18	jesse	actually we do have stuff on that disease. or at least, maybe rarer forms of that disease 
2018-03-23 14:40:14	gjabell	Lol 
2018-03-23 15:50:50	jesse	did ya get back from your eye doc? 
2018-03-23 15:51:10	gjabell	Still waiting for them to see me :( (no pun intended) 
2018-03-23 15:51:31	gjabell	It's in Durham too, so I'll probably be back around 5 or maybe 530 
2018-03-23 15:51:38	gjabell	Depending how long I have to wait 
2018-03-23 15:52:50	jesse	xD thats a good  intended pun 
2018-03-23 18:22:06	gjabell	Whelp, I have finally returned, after a long and arduous process xD 
2018-03-23 18:22:52	jesse	that sounds awful.  how the heck did that take 4 hours?! 
2018-03-23 18:23:55	gjabell	They were slow and it took me an hour to get back :( 
2018-03-23 18:24:00	gjabell	It was in durham 
2018-03-23 18:24:43	jesse	that really sucks dude. I've been messing with my raspberry pi and playing the 2nd south park game xD 
2018-03-23 18:24:53	gjabell	XD nice 
2018-03-23 18:25:08	gjabell	Now I finally get to get the server running lol 
2018-03-23 18:25:30	jesse	its pretty hard to ssh into it without the ethernet.
2018-03-23 18:25:30		can I see??!! 
2018-03-23 18:25:55	gjabell	Hmm yeah I'd imagine so xD 
2018-03-23 18:26:14	gjabell	Sure, I need to go grab a package from tower, I can meet you if you want 
2018-03-23 18:26:34	jesse	yea sure 
2018-03-23 18:26:40	gjabell	Kk 
2018-03-23 20:37:20	jesse	hey Galen, there was one more thing i forgot to ask, do you remember what you proposed in English 331 for the final essay thing? 
2018-03-23 20:37:52	gjabell	yeah, it was an android app for a fake garmin product xD 
2018-03-23 20:40:28	jesse	lol nice. I wanted to do propose something related to my research job, so I dont have to make up a scenario... but I wouldnt know what. maybe some feature for the webpage or something. 
2018-03-23 20:40:48	jesse	maybe the insurance function that I cringed about. 
2018-03-23 20:41:00	gjabell	could be 
2018-03-23 20:41:06	gjabell	it can be fairly small, whatever it is 
2018-03-23 20:41:13	gjabell	as long as you can go into detail about it 
2018-03-23 20:41:30	gjabell	I originally was going to go with a whole home automation system thing and she was like 'that's way too much' 
2018-03-23 20:41:41	gjabell	so I just pretended I was going to make an app for interacting with it instead 
2018-03-23 20:41:56	gjabell	and just went into a lot of detail in terms of the backend, database, frontend, etc. 
2018-03-23 20:42:39	jesse	lol but she wouldn't know if it's too much 
2018-03-23 20:43:07	gjabell	right, but the nice thing about doing comp sci stuff is that yoiu can basically make up bs and she won't know the difference 
2018-03-23 20:43:28	jesse	true. 
2018-03-24 18:01:24	jesse	have you looked into steganography? it's kinda neat. 
2018-03-24 18:03:20	jesse	i wonder if anyones found a way to hide a video inside another video. 
2018-03-24 18:25:41	gjabell	No, what is it? 
2018-03-24 18:26:28	jesse	hiding messages in pictures and stuff like that... but i think it would be cooler if you hid a picture in a picture or a video inside a video :P 
2018-03-24 18:26:35	gjabell	Huh 
2018-03-24 18:26:50	gjabell	Yeah that'd be neat xD 
2018-03-24 19:25:42	jesse	@jesse uploaded a file: https://sturgill-operators.slack.com/files/U3VPX29FW/F9V2VA0RF/togalen.jpg (toGalen) 
2018-03-24 20:24:52		getting channel history...
2018-03-22 12:28:09	jesse	I actually couldn't get it to install using gem. rather, it installed but couldn't run. 
2018-03-22 12:28:26	gjabell	Rip 
2018-03-22 12:29:15	jesse	I'll find a way lol... after I stop procrastinating on my game log 
2018-03-22 12:29:31	gjabell	XD 
2018-03-22 12:29:39	gjabell	I haven't even started lol 
2018-03-22 12:30:34	jesse	nice. unfortunately playing through a story game more than once and recording all your choices/decisions takes a ton of time. 
2018-03-22 12:38:18	gjabell	Yeah 
2018-03-22 12:38:29	gjabell	I'm just going to do the Stanley parable 
2018-03-22 12:39:24	jesse	I'm not sure what that is, but if you're using 'just' to describe it, then it sounds like a good choice... depression quest is kinda long. 
2018-03-22 12:43:13	gjabell	XD yeah the play through are pretty short 
2018-03-22 12:45:21	gjabell	Also idk if you have figured out summer housing yet, but I found out yesterday that they'll let people stay in WR even if they aren't doing summer school 
2018-03-22 12:47:34	jesse	wow really? when they emailed me a month ago, they said the opposite. I think I'm gonna be staying at my brother's place, but I don't really like that plan (other than not having to pay). 
2018-03-22 12:48:43	gjabell	Yeah I know, they just changed their minds xD
2018-03-22 12:48:43		That's fair
2018-03-22 12:48:43		If you decide to go with WR let me know and I'll add you as a preferred roommate if you want 
2018-03-22 13:05:26	jesse	Thanks, I probably won't though. If my brother doesn't want me taking his room, I'll definitely message you though.  
2018-03-22 13:05:39	jesse	Did housing for summer open up? 
2018-03-22 13:05:49	jesse	or has it been up? 
2018-03-22 13:13:27	gjabell	Sounds good
2018-03-22 13:13:27		Idk, they just made it an option so 
2018-03-22 15:12:30	jesse	do you know how long your going to make your game log? its gonna be structured differently than what we're used to. 
2018-03-22 15:13:35	gjabell	I honestly haven't looked into it much 
2018-03-22 15:14:00	gjabell	If there aren't any length requirements I'll just make it as little as possible while still answering the questions xD 
2018-03-22 15:15:19	jesse	yeah im thinking Ill just answer the questions and be done. it just concerns me that theyre using the word "essay" to describe the log. essay makes me think 12 pages xD 
2018-03-22 15:15:49	jesse	that diagram i made was a nightmare 
2018-03-22 15:16:52	gjabell	lol 
2018-03-22 15:18:06	gjabell	idk, it seems like it should be about as much content as the last game logs, including the diagram 
2018-03-22 15:18:09	jesse	plant uml helped but i had to split it into 5 pages/ 5 different diagrams 
2018-03-22 15:18:20	gjabell	so if the diagram has content then you probably don't need as much writing 
2018-03-22 15:18:22	gjabell	lol 
2018-03-22 15:18:26	gjabell	plant uml ftw 
2018-03-22 16:59:31	jesse	I made it so I can type tab anywhere on the current line and tab the whole line across :) . 
2018-03-22 17:00:41	jesse	and untabbing works too  
2018-03-22 17:35:11	gjabell	Bruh 
2018-03-22 17:35:15	gjabell	That's sweet@ 
2018-03-22 17:36:16	jesse	i can give you the lines in my vimrc, but you probably know how to do it. 
2018-03-22 17:36:54	jesse	map <Tab> :s/^/    <CR> 
2018-03-22 17:36:54	jesse	map <S-Tab> :s/^    /<CR> 
2018-03-22 17:37:09	gjabell	I actually don't know much about vimscript, so thanks xD 
2018-03-22 17:37:33	jesse	works in visual mode too. just highlight the lines you wanna change the indentation to. 
2018-03-22 17:37:59	jesse	those are the only two lines I use :) 
2018-03-22 17:43:50	gjabell	Neat 
2018-03-22 17:44:29	gjabell	mine is super long bc I just grabbed a bunch of stuff from other ones I've seen xD 
2018-03-22 17:44:41	gjabell	I've been slowly getting use to using the different plugins tho 
2018-03-22 17:44:45	gjabell	some of them are super nice 
2018-03-22 17:45:17	jesse	the only bad thing is that the selected text goes away. If you wanted to indent more than once, you have to highlight again. However, if you need to un-indent multiple times, you should probably refactor xD 
2018-03-22 17:45:28	gjabell	ah 
2018-03-22 17:45:29	gjabell	yeah xD 
2018-03-22 18:08:26	jesse	do you think 1.7 pages of text .7 pages of 2 small pictures  and 5 pages of a giant flowchart is good enough for this game log? 
2018-03-22 18:08:43	gjabell	Probably yeah 
2018-03-22 18:08:50	gjabell	They're pretty lenient on grading 
2018-03-23 09:30:18	jesse	hey galen, I  deactivated my facebook,  and i still have messenger.... although I dont have any way to check if my account was deactivated or not cuz if I try to sign in, it will activate my account... 
2018-03-23 09:30:51	gjabell	XD
2018-03-23 09:30:51		That's sweet 
2018-03-23 09:31:04	gjabell	Is there a difference between deactivating and deleting? 
2018-03-23 09:42:21	jesse	i think deactivating prevents users from accessing my data, but they can still do things like tag me or invite me to events. with deactivation, facebook still has their talons in my privacy xD... but if I had deleted, I dont think I would be able to use messenger without setting  up all of my contacts and groups again. 
2018-03-23 09:43:28	gjabell	ah, ok 
2018-03-23 09:43:49	gjabell	I would prefer to just not use messenger lol 
2018-03-23 09:43:58	gjabell	but unf not everyone is a comp sci person xD 
2018-03-23 09:44:41	jesse	it's only comp sci ppl using messenger for me. 
2018-03-23 09:45:11	jesse	don't they know that BBS is the way of the future?! 
2018-03-23 09:45:54	gjabell	lol 
2018-03-23 09:46:00	gjabell	what's BBS? 
2018-03-23 09:47:56	jesse	bulletin board systems. it was used back when you had to connect through phonelines to access a forum. a town forum would cost a lil extra to your phone bill, but all around the nation or world would be like making phone calls on a cruise. 
2018-03-23 09:48:31	gjabell	ah 
2018-03-23 09:48:55	gjabell	why aren't we still using that, I mean come on 
2018-03-23 09:49:18	gjabell	we could be sending messages through the phone lines and instead we use slack? 
2018-03-23 09:49:19	gjabell	smh 
2018-03-23 09:49:39	jesse	what is smh? 
2018-03-23 09:49:57	gjabell	shake(s) my head 
2018-03-23 09:52:45	jesse	ahh xD. ya know there's this strange new communications protocol where I can send and receive data through vibrating the air molecules. It uses up no wifi, no cellular data, and its ultra secure. 
2018-03-23 09:53:05	jesse	it's revolutionary 
2018-03-23 09:53:26	gjabell	is it morse code 
2018-03-23 09:53:42	jesse	xD even better... talking 
2018-03-23 09:53:52	gjabell	xD 
2018-03-23 09:54:49	gjabell	ofc if you really want it to be secure, you need to utilize a public/private key exchange to properly encryp the conversation 
2018-03-23 09:56:04	jesse	alcohol is a good way to encrypt data 
2018-03-23 09:56:40	gjabell	lol xD 
2018-03-23 10:17:19	jesse	btw, can you spy on my facebook account? xD 
2018-03-23 10:35:12	gjabell	like just go to it? 
2018-03-23 10:36:08	gjabell	yeah pretty sure it's invisible now 
2018-03-23 10:36:23	gjabell	I can't search for it through the default interface or my friends list 
2018-03-23 10:36:44	gjabell	looks like I can' 
2018-03-23 10:36:48	gjabell	t even tag you 
2018-03-23 10:39:30	jesse	alright. That's good enough for me xD. I'm not much of a privacy nut, I'd honestly just rather people not contact me if they are out of my life. 
2018-03-23 10:39:32	jesse	Thanks 
2018-03-23 10:39:37	gjabell	yeah that's fair 
2018-03-23 10:39:43	gjabell	kinda want to do that on mine too lol 
2018-03-23 10:40:07	gjabell	although I don't even use facebook most of the time so idk if there's anything I care about people seeing on it xD 
2018-03-23 10:40:48	jesse	Do it. I'll activate my facebook to check if your facebook account has been deactivated... but then youll have to activate your fb account to check if my account is deactivated...  
2018-03-23 10:41:05	gjabell	hmm... 
2018-03-23 10:41:27	gjabell	how do you even do it 
2018-03-23 10:42:10	jesse	Account Settings > General > Account Settings I think 
2018-03-23 10:42:17	jesse	wait... 
2018-03-23 10:42:21	gjabell	ah 
2018-03-23 10:42:22	jesse	i got that messed up haha 
2018-03-23 10:42:23	gjabell	manage account 
2018-03-23 10:44:36	gjabell	sayonara facebook 
2018-03-23 10:45:41	jesse	Stallman still doesn't approve unless we harass them to delete all of our data off their database. xD 
2018-03-23 10:46:00	gjabell	what the shit 
2018-03-23 10:46:21	gjabell	it forced me to log back into messenger and that reactivated facebook 
2018-03-23 10:46:39	gjabell	god dammit 
2018-03-23 10:46:46	jesse	Oh, theres an option below log-back-in where you just input your phone number 
2018-03-23 10:46:47	gjabell	I guess it's only messenger and not messenger lite that works 
2018-03-23 10:47:14	gjabell	which blows, because messenger sucks cock 
2018-03-23 10:48:52	gjabell	which interestingly probably tells us that the messenger lite app is just a wrapper around their web ui 
2018-03-23 10:50:11	jesse	nah theres a place you can just put in your phone number and it logs you in as if you had a facebook account.. your deactivated fb account may need your phone number. idk 
2018-03-23 10:50:29	gjabell	that's what I did on lite 
2018-03-23 10:50:33	gjabell	are you using lite or default? 
2018-03-23 10:51:14	jesse	the regular one 
2018-03-23 10:51:22	jesse	ill download lite to check it 
2018-03-23 10:52:25	jesse	it doesn't look like lite has those options. 
2018-03-23 10:52:29	gjabell	fuck me, did it again 
2018-03-23 10:52:45	gjabell	where is the option? 
2018-03-23 10:52:52	jesse	on the regular one? 
2018-03-23 10:52:59	gjabell	yea 
2018-03-23 10:54:09	jesse	ill look into it. im gonna reinstall the regular one. 
2018-03-23 10:54:17	gjabell	k 
2018-03-23 10:57:29	jesse	So when I did it, it showed up a popup that said I could continue using messenger without my facebook account. I can head over to your apartment to show/help ya if ya want. 
2018-03-23 10:57:48	gjabell	hmm 
2018-03-23 10:57:52	gjabell	sure, why not xD 
2018-03-23 10:58:02	gjabell	let me brush my teeth first tho, give me 5 or so 
2018-03-23 10:59:06	jesse	Same. 
2018-03-23 10:59:28	gjabell	oh 
2018-03-23 10:59:35	gjabell	there we go, I got the message too 
2018-03-23 10:59:39	gjabell	weird that I didn't get it before 
2018-03-23 11:07:36	jesse	still want me to come over or nah? 
2018-03-23 11:07:55	gjabell	up to you, I'm always down to chat about random computer stuff xD 
2018-03-23 11:08:25	gjabell	I have to go sell someone a mobo around 1140 tho so unless you're really bored and want to come with we won't be able to hang out for very long lol 
2018-03-23 11:09:01	gjabell	actually might be more like 1130, cause I need gas too 
2018-03-23 11:09:54	jesse	what's a mobo? 
2018-03-23 11:09:58	gjabell	motherboard 
2018-03-23 11:10:04	gjabell	for a computer 
2018-03-23 11:10:22	jesse	lol i know what motherboards are for haha 
2018-03-23 11:10:27	gjabell	ok just makign sure xD 
2018-03-23 11:11:16	gjabell	then I'm buying some ram, so I cna complete my server xD 
2018-03-23 11:12:18	jesse	I'm probably gonna go to the grocery store with my roommate around 12. maybe ill visit later today. 
2018-03-23 11:12:36	gjabell	sounds like a plan 
2018-03-23 11:12:47	gjabell	I'll hopefully be back here around 1 or so 
2018-03-23 11:13:34	jesse	same 
2018-03-23 13:18:38	jesse	i think they have free chipoltle either on the oval or at the cistern. are you going to that? 
2018-03-23 13:19:21	gjabell	Prollt not lol, wanna get the server up and running xD 
2018-03-23 13:19:29	jesse	XD 
2018-03-23 14:10:19	jesse	still workin on your server? 
2018-03-23 14:11:20	gjabell	Yep 
2018-03-23 14:11:26	gjabell	It isn't started, which is bad lol 
2018-03-23 14:11:43	jesse	want some help? I'm pretty bored 
2018-03-23 14:12:01	jesse	I'm not knowledgble in servrs tho 
2018-03-23 14:12:21	gjabell	I actually have to go to a doctors appointment in about 15 min but you're welcome to come by afterwards 
2018-03-23 14:12:41	jesse	oki. whats the doctors appointment for? 
2018-03-23 14:12:53	gjabell	It's a post op for my eye lol 
2018-03-23 14:13:03	gjabell	Like a 3 month checkup thing 
2018-03-23 14:13:19	jesse	what did you to your eye? 
2018-03-23 14:13:30	jesse	what was the op? 
2018-03-23 14:14:11	gjabell	I had a small surgery done back in december 
2018-03-23 14:14:17	gjabell	For keratakonus 
2018-03-23 14:16:01	gjabell	Well, server finally turned on, which is good BC it hopefully means everything I'd OK xD but idk why it wasn't working before lol 
2018-03-23 14:16:45	jesse	keratakonus sounds bad. 
2018-03-23 14:17:12	gjabell	I'll explain it when I get back xD
2018-03-23 14:17:12		It sounds worse than it is haha 
2018-03-23 14:17:18	jesse	ok 
2018-03-23 14:17:23	jesse	is it rare? 
2018-03-23 14:17:55	gjabell	About 1 in 10000 I think 
2018-03-23 14:18:21	jesse	i wonder if itll show up on the website my research is making 
2018-03-23 14:19:56	jesse	unless you spelled it wrong, it is not on our webpage :( 
2018-03-23 14:20:56	gjabell	It's entirely possible I did
2018-03-23 14:20:56		Although I'd be pretty surprised if it were xD 
2018-03-23 14:39:18	jesse	actually we do have stuff on that disease. or at least, maybe rarer forms of that disease 
2018-03-23 14:40:14	gjabell	Lol 
2018-03-23 15:50:50	jesse	did ya get back from your eye doc? 
2018-03-23 15:51:10	gjabell	Still waiting for them to see me :( (no pun intended) 
2018-03-23 15:51:31	gjabell	It's in Durham too, so I'll probably be back around 5 or maybe 530 
2018-03-23 15:51:38	gjabell	Depending how long I have to wait 
2018-03-23 15:52:50	jesse	xD thats a good  intended pun 
2018-03-23 18:22:06	gjabell	Whelp, I have finally returned, after a long and arduous process xD 
2018-03-23 18:22:52	jesse	that sounds awful.  how the heck did that take 4 hours?! 
2018-03-23 18:23:55	gjabell	They were slow and it took me an hour to get back :( 
2018-03-23 18:24:00	gjabell	It was in durham 
2018-03-23 18:24:43	jesse	that really sucks dude. I've been messing with my raspberry pi and playing the 2nd south park game xD 
2018-03-23 18:24:53	gjabell	XD nice 
2018-03-23 18:25:08	gjabell	Now I finally get to get the server running lol 
2018-03-23 18:25:30	jesse	its pretty hard to ssh into it without the ethernet.
2018-03-23 18:25:30		can I see??!! 
2018-03-23 18:25:55	gjabell	Hmm yeah I'd imagine so xD 
2018-03-23 18:26:14	gjabell	Sure, I need to go grab a package from tower, I can meet you if you want 
2018-03-23 18:26:34	jesse	yea sure 
2018-03-23 18:26:40	gjabell	Kk 
2018-03-23 20:37:20	jesse	hey Galen, there was one more thing i forgot to ask, do you remember what you proposed in English 331 for the final essay thing? 
2018-03-23 20:37:52	gjabell	yeah, it was an android app for a fake garmin product xD 
2018-03-23 20:40:28	jesse	lol nice. I wanted to do propose something related to my research job, so I dont have to make up a scenario... but I wouldnt know what. maybe some feature for the webpage or something. 
2018-03-23 20:40:48	jesse	maybe the insurance function that I cringed about. 
2018-03-23 20:41:00	gjabell	could be 
2018-03-23 20:41:06	gjabell	it can be fairly small, whatever it is 
2018-03-23 20:41:13	gjabell	as long as you can go into detail about it 
2018-03-23 20:41:30	gjabell	I originally was going to go with a whole home automation system thing and she was like 'that's way too much' 
2018-03-23 20:41:41	gjabell	so I just pretended I was going to make an app for interacting with it instead 
2018-03-23 20:41:56	gjabell	and just went into a lot of detail in terms of the backend, database, frontend, etc. 
2018-03-23 20:42:39	jesse	lol but she wouldn't know if it's too much 
2018-03-23 20:43:07	gjabell	right, but the nice thing about doing comp sci stuff is that yoiu can basically make up bs and she won't know the difference 
2018-03-23 20:43:28	jesse	true. 
2018-03-24 18:01:24	jesse	have you looked into steganography? it's kinda neat. 
2018-03-24 18:03:20	jesse	i wonder if anyones found a way to hide a video inside another video. 
2018-03-24 18:25:41	gjabell	No, what is it? 
2018-03-24 18:26:28	jesse	hiding messages in pictures and stuff like that... but i think it would be cooler if you hid a picture in a picture or a video inside a video :P 
2018-03-24 18:26:35	gjabell	Huh 
2018-03-24 18:26:50	gjabell	Yeah that'd be neat xD 
2018-03-24 19:25:42	jesse	@jesse uploaded a file: https://sturgill-operators.slack.com/files/U3VPX29FW/F9V2VA0RF/togalen.jpg (toGalen) 
2018-03-24 20:25:26	jesse	@jesse uploaded a file: https://sturgill-operators.slack.com/files/U3VPX29FW/F9WE7AMP0/pandainsidepanda.jpg (pandainsidepanda) 
2018-03-25 11:52:20		getting channel history...
2018-03-22 12:29:31	gjabell	XD 
2018-03-22 12:29:39	gjabell	I haven't even started lol 
2018-03-22 12:30:34	jesse	nice. unfortunately playing through a story game more than once and recording all your choices/decisions takes a ton of time. 
2018-03-22 12:38:18	gjabell	Yeah 
2018-03-22 12:38:29	gjabell	I'm just going to do the Stanley parable 
2018-03-22 12:39:24	jesse	I'm not sure what that is, but if you're using 'just' to describe it, then it sounds like a good choice... depression quest is kinda long. 
2018-03-22 12:43:13	gjabell	XD yeah the play through are pretty short 
2018-03-22 12:45:21	gjabell	Also idk if you have figured out summer housing yet, but I found out yesterday that they'll let people stay in WR even if they aren't doing summer school 
2018-03-22 12:47:34	jesse	wow really? when they emailed me a month ago, they said the opposite. I think I'm gonna be staying at my brother's place, but I don't really like that plan (other than not having to pay). 
2018-03-22 12:48:43	gjabell	Yeah I know, they just changed their minds xD
2018-03-22 12:48:43		That's fair
2018-03-22 12:48:43		If you decide to go with WR let me know and I'll add you as a preferred roommate if you want 
2018-03-22 13:05:26	jesse	Thanks, I probably won't though. If my brother doesn't want me taking his room, I'll definitely message you though.  
2018-03-22 13:05:39	jesse	Did housing for summer open up? 
2018-03-22 13:05:49	jesse	or has it been up? 
2018-03-22 13:13:27	gjabell	Sounds good
2018-03-22 13:13:27		Idk, they just made it an option so 
2018-03-22 15:12:30	jesse	do you know how long your going to make your game log? its gonna be structured differently than what we're used to. 
2018-03-22 15:13:35	gjabell	I honestly haven't looked into it much 
2018-03-22 15:14:00	gjabell	If there aren't any length requirements I'll just make it as little as possible while still answering the questions xD 
2018-03-22 15:15:19	jesse	yeah im thinking Ill just answer the questions and be done. it just concerns me that theyre using the word "essay" to describe the log. essay makes me think 12 pages xD 
2018-03-22 15:15:49	jesse	that diagram i made was a nightmare 
2018-03-22 15:16:52	gjabell	lol 
2018-03-22 15:18:06	gjabell	idk, it seems like it should be about as much content as the last game logs, including the diagram 
2018-03-22 15:18:09	jesse	plant uml helped but i had to split it into 5 pages/ 5 different diagrams 
2018-03-22 15:18:20	gjabell	so if the diagram has content then you probably don't need as much writing 
2018-03-22 15:18:22	gjabell	lol 
2018-03-22 15:18:26	gjabell	plant uml ftw 
2018-03-22 16:59:31	jesse	I made it so I can type tab anywhere on the current line and tab the whole line across :) . 
2018-03-22 17:00:41	jesse	and untabbing works too  
2018-03-22 17:35:11	gjabell	Bruh 
2018-03-22 17:35:15	gjabell	That's sweet@ 
2018-03-22 17:36:16	jesse	i can give you the lines in my vimrc, but you probably know how to do it. 
2018-03-22 17:36:54	jesse	map <Tab> :s/^/    <CR> 
2018-03-22 17:36:54	jesse	map <S-Tab> :s/^    /<CR> 
2018-03-22 17:37:09	gjabell	I actually don't know much about vimscript, so thanks xD 
2018-03-22 17:37:33	jesse	works in visual mode too. just highlight the lines you wanna change the indentation to. 
2018-03-22 17:37:59	jesse	those are the only two lines I use :) 
2018-03-22 17:43:50	gjabell	Neat 
2018-03-22 17:44:29	gjabell	mine is super long bc I just grabbed a bunch of stuff from other ones I've seen xD 
2018-03-22 17:44:41	gjabell	I've been slowly getting use to using the different plugins tho 
2018-03-22 17:44:45	gjabell	some of them are super nice 
2018-03-22 17:45:17	jesse	the only bad thing is that the selected text goes away. If you wanted to indent more than once, you have to highlight again. However, if you need to un-indent multiple times, you should probably refactor xD 
2018-03-22 17:45:28	gjabell	ah 
2018-03-22 17:45:29	gjabell	yeah xD 
2018-03-22 18:08:26	jesse	do you think 1.7 pages of text .7 pages of 2 small pictures  and 5 pages of a giant flowchart is good enough for this game log? 
2018-03-22 18:08:43	gjabell	Probably yeah 
2018-03-22 18:08:50	gjabell	They're pretty lenient on grading 
2018-03-23 09:30:18	jesse	hey galen, I  deactivated my facebook,  and i still have messenger.... although I dont have any way to check if my account was deactivated or not cuz if I try to sign in, it will activate my account... 
2018-03-23 09:30:51	gjabell	XD
2018-03-23 09:30:51		That's sweet 
2018-03-23 09:31:04	gjabell	Is there a difference between deactivating and deleting? 
2018-03-23 09:42:21	jesse	i think deactivating prevents users from accessing my data, but they can still do things like tag me or invite me to events. with deactivation, facebook still has their talons in my privacy xD... but if I had deleted, I dont think I would be able to use messenger without setting  up all of my contacts and groups again. 
2018-03-23 09:43:28	gjabell	ah, ok 
2018-03-23 09:43:49	gjabell	I would prefer to just not use messenger lol 
2018-03-23 09:43:58	gjabell	but unf not everyone is a comp sci person xD 
2018-03-23 09:44:41	jesse	it's only comp sci ppl using messenger for me. 
2018-03-23 09:45:11	jesse	don't they know that BBS is the way of the future?! 
2018-03-23 09:45:54	gjabell	lol 
2018-03-23 09:46:00	gjabell	what's BBS? 
2018-03-23 09:47:56	jesse	bulletin board systems. it was used back when you had to connect through phonelines to access a forum. a town forum would cost a lil extra to your phone bill, but all around the nation or world would be like making phone calls on a cruise. 
2018-03-23 09:48:31	gjabell	ah 
2018-03-23 09:48:55	gjabell	why aren't we still using that, I mean come on 
2018-03-23 09:49:18	gjabell	we could be sending messages through the phone lines and instead we use slack? 
2018-03-23 09:49:19	gjabell	smh 
2018-03-23 09:49:39	jesse	what is smh? 
2018-03-23 09:49:57	gjabell	shake(s) my head 
2018-03-23 09:52:45	jesse	ahh xD. ya know there's this strange new communications protocol where I can send and receive data through vibrating the air molecules. It uses up no wifi, no cellular data, and its ultra secure. 
2018-03-23 09:53:05	jesse	it's revolutionary 
2018-03-23 09:53:26	gjabell	is it morse code 
2018-03-23 09:53:42	jesse	xD even better... talking 
2018-03-23 09:53:52	gjabell	xD 
2018-03-23 09:54:49	gjabell	ofc if you really want it to be secure, you need to utilize a public/private key exchange to properly encryp the conversation 
2018-03-23 09:56:04	jesse	alcohol is a good way to encrypt data 
2018-03-23 09:56:40	gjabell	lol xD 
2018-03-23 10:17:19	jesse	btw, can you spy on my facebook account? xD 
2018-03-23 10:35:12	gjabell	like just go to it? 
2018-03-23 10:36:08	gjabell	yeah pretty sure it's invisible now 
2018-03-23 10:36:23	gjabell	I can't search for it through the default interface or my friends list 
2018-03-23 10:36:44	gjabell	looks like I can' 
2018-03-23 10:36:48	gjabell	t even tag you 
2018-03-23 10:39:30	jesse	alright. That's good enough for me xD. I'm not much of a privacy nut, I'd honestly just rather people not contact me if they are out of my life. 
2018-03-23 10:39:32	jesse	Thanks 
2018-03-23 10:39:37	gjabell	yeah that's fair 
2018-03-23 10:39:43	gjabell	kinda want to do that on mine too lol 
2018-03-23 10:40:07	gjabell	although I don't even use facebook most of the time so idk if there's anything I care about people seeing on it xD 
2018-03-23 10:40:48	jesse	Do it. I'll activate my facebook to check if your facebook account has been deactivated... but then youll have to activate your fb account to check if my account is deactivated...  
2018-03-23 10:41:05	gjabell	hmm... 
2018-03-23 10:41:27	gjabell	how do you even do it 
2018-03-23 10:42:10	jesse	Account Settings > General > Account Settings I think 
2018-03-23 10:42:17	jesse	wait... 
2018-03-23 10:42:21	gjabell	ah 
2018-03-23 10:42:22	jesse	i got that messed up haha 
2018-03-23 10:42:23	gjabell	manage account 
2018-03-23 10:44:36	gjabell	sayonara facebook 
2018-03-23 10:45:41	jesse	Stallman still doesn't approve unless we harass them to delete all of our data off their database. xD 
2018-03-23 10:46:00	gjabell	what the shit 
2018-03-23 10:46:21	gjabell	it forced me to log back into messenger and that reactivated facebook 
2018-03-23 10:46:39	gjabell	god dammit 
2018-03-23 10:46:46	jesse	Oh, theres an option below log-back-in where you just input your phone number 
2018-03-23 10:46:47	gjabell	I guess it's only messenger and not messenger lite that works 
2018-03-23 10:47:14	gjabell	which blows, because messenger sucks cock 
2018-03-23 10:48:52	gjabell	which interestingly probably tells us that the messenger lite app is just a wrapper around their web ui 
2018-03-23 10:50:11	jesse	nah theres a place you can just put in your phone number and it logs you in as if you had a facebook account.. your deactivated fb account may need your phone number. idk 
2018-03-23 10:50:29	gjabell	that's what I did on lite 
2018-03-23 10:50:33	gjabell	are you using lite or default? 
2018-03-23 10:51:14	jesse	the regular one 
2018-03-23 10:51:22	jesse	ill download lite to check it 
2018-03-23 10:52:25	jesse	it doesn't look like lite has those options. 
2018-03-23 10:52:29	gjabell	fuck me, did it again 
2018-03-23 10:52:45	gjabell	where is the option? 
2018-03-23 10:52:52	jesse	on the regular one? 
2018-03-23 10:52:59	gjabell	yea 
2018-03-23 10:54:09	jesse	ill look into it. im gonna reinstall the regular one. 
2018-03-23 10:54:17	gjabell	k 
2018-03-23 10:57:29	jesse	So when I did it, it showed up a popup that said I could continue using messenger without my facebook account. I can head over to your apartment to show/help ya if ya want. 
2018-03-23 10:57:48	gjabell	hmm 
2018-03-23 10:57:52	gjabell	sure, why not xD 
2018-03-23 10:58:02	gjabell	let me brush my teeth first tho, give me 5 or so 
2018-03-23 10:59:06	jesse	Same. 
2018-03-23 10:59:28	gjabell	oh 
2018-03-23 10:59:35	gjabell	there we go, I got the message too 
2018-03-23 10:59:39	gjabell	weird that I didn't get it before 
2018-03-23 11:07:36	jesse	still want me to come over or nah? 
2018-03-23 11:07:55	gjabell	up to you, I'm always down to chat about random computer stuff xD 
2018-03-23 11:08:25	gjabell	I have to go sell someone a mobo around 1140 tho so unless you're really bored and want to come with we won't be able to hang out for very long lol 
2018-03-23 11:09:01	gjabell	actually might be more like 1130, cause I need gas too 
2018-03-23 11:09:54	jesse	what's a mobo? 
2018-03-23 11:09:58	gjabell	motherboard 
2018-03-23 11:10:04	gjabell	for a computer 
2018-03-23 11:10:22	jesse	lol i know what motherboards are for haha 
2018-03-23 11:10:27	gjabell	ok just makign sure xD 
2018-03-23 11:11:16	gjabell	then I'm buying some ram, so I cna complete my server xD 
2018-03-23 11:12:18	jesse	I'm probably gonna go to the grocery store with my roommate around 12. maybe ill visit later today. 
2018-03-23 11:12:36	gjabell	sounds like a plan 
2018-03-23 11:12:47	gjabell	I'll hopefully be back here around 1 or so 
2018-03-23 11:13:34	jesse	same 
2018-03-23 13:18:38	jesse	i think they have free chipoltle either on the oval or at the cistern. are you going to that? 
2018-03-23 13:19:21	gjabell	Prollt not lol, wanna get the server up and running xD 
2018-03-23 13:19:29	jesse	XD 
2018-03-23 14:10:19	jesse	still workin on your server? 
2018-03-23 14:11:20	gjabell	Yep 
2018-03-23 14:11:26	gjabell	It isn't started, which is bad lol 
2018-03-23 14:11:43	jesse	want some help? I'm pretty bored 
2018-03-23 14:12:01	jesse	I'm not knowledgble in servrs tho 
2018-03-23 14:12:21	gjabell	I actually have to go to a doctors appointment in about 15 min but you're welcome to come by afterwards 
2018-03-23 14:12:41	jesse	oki. whats the doctors appointment for? 
2018-03-23 14:12:53	gjabell	It's a post op for my eye lol 
2018-03-23 14:13:03	gjabell	Like a 3 month checkup thing 
2018-03-23 14:13:19	jesse	what did you to your eye? 
2018-03-23 14:13:30	jesse	what was the op? 
2018-03-23 14:14:11	gjabell	I had a small surgery done back in december 
2018-03-23 14:14:17	gjabell	For keratakonus 
2018-03-23 14:16:01	gjabell	Well, server finally turned on, which is good BC it hopefully means everything I'd OK xD but idk why it wasn't working before lol 
2018-03-23 14:16:45	jesse	keratakonus sounds bad. 
2018-03-23 14:17:12	gjabell	I'll explain it when I get back xD
2018-03-23 14:17:12		It sounds worse than it is haha 
2018-03-23 14:17:18	jesse	ok 
2018-03-23 14:17:23	jesse	is it rare? 
2018-03-23 14:17:55	gjabell	About 1 in 10000 I think 
2018-03-23 14:18:21	jesse	i wonder if itll show up on the website my research is making 
2018-03-23 14:19:56	jesse	unless you spelled it wrong, it is not on our webpage :( 
2018-03-23 14:20:56	gjabell	It's entirely possible I did
2018-03-23 14:20:56		Although I'd be pretty surprised if it were xD 
2018-03-23 14:39:18	jesse	actually we do have stuff on that disease. or at least, maybe rarer forms of that disease 
2018-03-23 14:40:14	gjabell	Lol 
2018-03-23 15:50:50	jesse	did ya get back from your eye doc? 
2018-03-23 15:51:10	gjabell	Still waiting for them to see me :( (no pun intended) 
2018-03-23 15:51:31	gjabell	It's in Durham too, so I'll probably be back around 5 or maybe 530 
2018-03-23 15:51:38	gjabell	Depending how long I have to wait 
2018-03-23 15:52:50	jesse	xD thats a good  intended pun 
2018-03-23 18:22:06	gjabell	Whelp, I have finally returned, after a long and arduous process xD 
2018-03-23 18:22:52	jesse	that sounds awful.  how the heck did that take 4 hours?! 
2018-03-23 18:23:55	gjabell	They were slow and it took me an hour to get back :( 
2018-03-23 18:24:00	gjabell	It was in durham 
2018-03-23 18:24:43	jesse	that really sucks dude. I've been messing with my raspberry pi and playing the 2nd south park game xD 
2018-03-23 18:24:53	gjabell	XD nice 
2018-03-23 18:25:08	gjabell	Now I finally get to get the server running lol 
2018-03-23 18:25:30	jesse	its pretty hard to ssh into it without the ethernet.
2018-03-23 18:25:30		can I see??!! 
2018-03-23 18:25:55	gjabell	Hmm yeah I'd imagine so xD 
2018-03-23 18:26:14	gjabell	Sure, I need to go grab a package from tower, I can meet you if you want 
2018-03-23 18:26:34	jesse	yea sure 
2018-03-23 18:26:40	gjabell	Kk 
2018-03-23 20:37:20	jesse	hey Galen, there was one more thing i forgot to ask, do you remember what you proposed in English 331 for the final essay thing? 
2018-03-23 20:37:52	gjabell	yeah, it was an android app for a fake garmin product xD 
2018-03-23 20:40:28	jesse	lol nice. I wanted to do propose something related to my research job, so I dont have to make up a scenario... but I wouldnt know what. maybe some feature for the webpage or something. 
2018-03-23 20:40:48	jesse	maybe the insurance function that I cringed about. 
2018-03-23 20:41:00	gjabell	could be 
2018-03-23 20:41:06	gjabell	it can be fairly small, whatever it is 
2018-03-23 20:41:13	gjabell	as long as you can go into detail about it 
2018-03-23 20:41:30	gjabell	I originally was going to go with a whole home automation system thing and she was like 'that's way too much' 
2018-03-23 20:41:41	gjabell	so I just pretended I was going to make an app for interacting with it instead 
2018-03-23 20:41:56	gjabell	and just went into a lot of detail in terms of the backend, database, frontend, etc. 
2018-03-23 20:42:39	jesse	lol but she wouldn't know if it's too much 
2018-03-23 20:43:07	gjabell	right, but the nice thing about doing comp sci stuff is that yoiu can basically make up bs and she won't know the difference 
2018-03-23 20:43:28	jesse	true. 
2018-03-24 18:01:24	jesse	have you looked into steganography? it's kinda neat. 
2018-03-24 18:03:20	jesse	i wonder if anyones found a way to hide a video inside another video. 
2018-03-24 18:25:41	gjabell	No, what is it? 
2018-03-24 18:26:28	jesse	hiding messages in pictures and stuff like that... but i think it would be cooler if you hid a picture in a picture or a video inside a video :P 
2018-03-24 18:26:35	gjabell	Huh 
2018-03-24 18:26:50	gjabell	Yeah that'd be neat xD 
2018-03-24 19:25:42	jesse	@jesse uploaded a file: https://sturgill-operators.slack.com/files/U3VPX29FW/F9V2VA0RF/togalen.jpg (toGalen) 
2018-03-24 20:25:26	jesse	@jesse uploaded a file: https://sturgill-operators.slack.com/files/U3VPX29FW/F9WE7AMP0/pandainsidepanda.jpg (pandainsidepanda) 
2018-03-24 22:24:36	gjabell	Lol 
2018-03-24 23:02:01	jesse	there are messages in those pics btw. 
2018-03-26 09:07:57		getting channel history...
2018-03-22 12:29:31	gjabell	XD 
2018-03-22 12:29:39	gjabell	I haven't even started lol 
2018-03-22 12:30:34	jesse	nice. unfortunately playing through a story game more than once and recording all your choices/decisions takes a ton of time. 
2018-03-22 12:38:18	gjabell	Yeah 
2018-03-22 12:38:29	gjabell	I'm just going to do the Stanley parable 
2018-03-22 12:39:24	jesse	I'm not sure what that is, but if you're using 'just' to describe it, then it sounds like a good choice... depression quest is kinda long. 
2018-03-22 12:43:13	gjabell	XD yeah the play through are pretty short 
2018-03-22 12:45:21	gjabell	Also idk if you have figured out summer housing yet, but I found out yesterday that they'll let people stay in WR even if they aren't doing summer school 
2018-03-22 12:47:34	jesse	wow really? when they emailed me a month ago, they said the opposite. I think I'm gonna be staying at my brother's place, but I don't really like that plan (other than not having to pay). 
2018-03-22 12:48:43	gjabell	Yeah I know, they just changed their minds xD
2018-03-22 12:48:43		That's fair
2018-03-22 12:48:43		If you decide to go with WR let me know and I'll add you as a preferred roommate if you want 
2018-03-22 13:05:26	jesse	Thanks, I probably won't though. If my brother doesn't want me taking his room, I'll definitely message you though.  
2018-03-22 13:05:39	jesse	Did housing for summer open up? 
2018-03-22 13:05:49	jesse	or has it been up? 
2018-03-22 13:13:27	gjabell	Sounds good
2018-03-22 13:13:27		Idk, they just made it an option so 
2018-03-22 15:12:30	jesse	do you know how long your going to make your game log? its gonna be structured differently than what we're used to. 
2018-03-22 15:13:35	gjabell	I honestly haven't looked into it much 
2018-03-22 15:14:00	gjabell	If there aren't any length requirements I'll just make it as little as possible while still answering the questions xD 
2018-03-22 15:15:19	jesse	yeah im thinking Ill just answer the questions and be done. it just concerns me that theyre using the word "essay" to describe the log. essay makes me think 12 pages xD 
2018-03-22 15:15:49	jesse	that diagram i made was a nightmare 
2018-03-22 15:16:52	gjabell	lol 
2018-03-22 15:18:06	gjabell	idk, it seems like it should be about as much content as the last game logs, including the diagram 
2018-03-22 15:18:09	jesse	plant uml helped but i had to split it into 5 pages/ 5 different diagrams 
2018-03-22 15:18:20	gjabell	so if the diagram has content then you probably don't need as much writing 
2018-03-22 15:18:22	gjabell	lol 
2018-03-22 15:18:26	gjabell	plant uml ftw 
2018-03-22 16:59:31	jesse	I made it so I can type tab anywhere on the current line and tab the whole line across :) . 
2018-03-22 17:00:41	jesse	and untabbing works too  
2018-03-22 17:35:11	gjabell	Bruh 
2018-03-22 17:35:15	gjabell	That's sweet@ 
2018-03-22 17:36:16	jesse	i can give you the lines in my vimrc, but you probably know how to do it. 
2018-03-22 17:36:54	jesse	map <Tab> :s/^/    <CR> 
2018-03-22 17:36:54	jesse	map <S-Tab> :s/^    /<CR> 
2018-03-22 17:37:09	gjabell	I actually don't know much about vimscript, so thanks xD 
2018-03-22 17:37:33	jesse	works in visual mode too. just highlight the lines you wanna change the indentation to. 
2018-03-22 17:37:59	jesse	those are the only two lines I use :) 
2018-03-22 17:43:50	gjabell	Neat 
2018-03-22 17:44:29	gjabell	mine is super long bc I just grabbed a bunch of stuff from other ones I've seen xD 
2018-03-22 17:44:41	gjabell	I've been slowly getting use to using the different plugins tho 
2018-03-22 17:44:45	gjabell	some of them are super nice 
2018-03-22 17:45:17	jesse	the only bad thing is that the selected text goes away. If you wanted to indent more than once, you have to highlight again. However, if you need to un-indent multiple times, you should probably refactor xD 
2018-03-22 17:45:28	gjabell	ah 
2018-03-22 17:45:29	gjabell	yeah xD 
2018-03-22 18:08:26	jesse	do you think 1.7 pages of text .7 pages of 2 small pictures  and 5 pages of a giant flowchart is good enough for this game log? 
2018-03-22 18:08:43	gjabell	Probably yeah 
2018-03-22 18:08:50	gjabell	They're pretty lenient on grading 
2018-03-23 09:30:18	jesse	hey galen, I  deactivated my facebook,  and i still have messenger.... although I dont have any way to check if my account was deactivated or not cuz if I try to sign in, it will activate my account... 
2018-03-23 09:30:51	gjabell	XD
2018-03-23 09:30:51		That's sweet 
2018-03-23 09:31:04	gjabell	Is there a difference between deactivating and deleting? 
2018-03-23 09:42:21	jesse	i think deactivating prevents users from accessing my data, but they can still do things like tag me or invite me to events. with deactivation, facebook still has their talons in my privacy xD... but if I had deleted, I dont think I would be able to use messenger without setting  up all of my contacts and groups again. 
2018-03-23 09:43:28	gjabell	ah, ok 
2018-03-23 09:43:49	gjabell	I would prefer to just not use messenger lol 
2018-03-23 09:43:58	gjabell	but unf not everyone is a comp sci person xD 
2018-03-23 09:44:41	jesse	it's only comp sci ppl using messenger for me. 
2018-03-23 09:45:11	jesse	don't they know that BBS is the way of the future?! 
2018-03-23 09:45:54	gjabell	lol 
2018-03-23 09:46:00	gjabell	what's BBS? 
2018-03-23 09:47:56	jesse	bulletin board systems. it was used back when you had to connect through phonelines to access a forum. a town forum would cost a lil extra to your phone bill, but all around the nation or world would be like making phone calls on a cruise. 
2018-03-23 09:48:31	gjabell	ah 
2018-03-23 09:48:55	gjabell	why aren't we still using that, I mean come on 
2018-03-23 09:49:18	gjabell	we could be sending messages through the phone lines and instead we use slack? 
2018-03-23 09:49:19	gjabell	smh 
2018-03-23 09:49:39	jesse	what is smh? 
2018-03-23 09:49:57	gjabell	shake(s) my head 
2018-03-23 09:52:45	jesse	ahh xD. ya know there's this strange new communications protocol where I can send and receive data through vibrating the air molecules. It uses up no wifi, no cellular data, and its ultra secure. 
2018-03-23 09:53:05	jesse	it's revolutionary 
2018-03-23 09:53:26	gjabell	is it morse code

2018-03-23 09:54:49	gjabell	ofc if you really want it to be secure, you need to utilize a public/private key exchange to properly encryp the conversation

2018-03-23 10:48:52	gjabell	which interestingly probably tells us that the messenger lite app is just a wrapper around their web ui

2018-03-23 14:11:20	gjabell	Yep 
2018-03-23 14:11:26	gjabell	It isn't started, which is bad lol 
2018-03-23 14:11:43	jesse	want some help? I'm pretty bored 
2018-03-23 14:12:01	jesse	I'm not knowledgble in servrs tho 
2018-03-23 14:12:21	gjabell	I actually have to go to a doctors appointment in about 15 min but you're welcome to come by afterwards 
2018-03-23 14:12:41	jesse	oki. whats the doctors appointment for? 
2018-03-23 14:12:53	gjabell	It's a post op for my eye lol 
2018-03-23 14:13:03	gjabell	Like a 3 month checkup thing 
2018-03-23 14:13:19	jesse	what did you to your eye? 
2018-03-23 14:13:30	jesse	what was the op? 
2018-03-23 14:14:11	gjabell	I had a small surgery done back in december 
2018-03-23 14:14:17	gjabell	For keratakonus 
2018-03-23 14:16:01	gjabell	Well, server finally turned on, which is good BC it hopefully means everything I'd OK xD but idk why it wasn't working before lol 
2018-03-23 14:16:45	jesse	keratakonus sounds bad. 
2018-03-23 14:17:12	gjabell	I'll explain it when I get back xD
2018-03-23 14:17:12		It sounds worse than it is haha 
2018-03-23 14:17:18	jesse	ok 
2018-03-23 14:17:23	jesse	is it rare? 
2018-03-23 14:17:55	gjabell	About 1 in 10000 I think 
2018-03-23 14:18:21	jesse	i wonder if itll show up on the website my research is making 
2018-03-23 14:19:56	jesse	unless you spelled it wrong, it is not on our webpage :( 
2018-03-23 14:20:56	gjabell	It's entirely possible I did
2018-03-23 14:20:56		Although I'd be pretty surprised if it were xD 
2018-03-23 14:39:18	jesse	actually we do have stuff on that disease. or at least, maybe rarer forms of that disease 
2018-03-23 14:40:14	gjabell	Lol 
2018-03-23 15:50:50	jesse	did ya get back from your eye doc? 
2018-03-23 15:51:10	gjabell	Still waiting for them to see me :( (no pun intended) 
2018-03-23 15:51:31	gjabell	It's in Durham too, so I'll probably be back around 5 or maybe 530 
2018-03-23 15:51:38	gjabell	Depending how long I have to wait 
2018-03-23 15:52:50	jesse	xD thats a good  intended pun 
2018-03-23 18:22:06	gjabell	Whelp, I have finally returned, after a long and arduous process xD 
2018-03-23 18:22:52	jesse	that sounds awful.  how the heck did that take 4 hours?! 
2018-03-23 18:23:55	gjabell	They were slow and it took me an hour to get back :( 
2018-03-23 18:24:00	gjabell	It was in durham 
2018-03-23 18:24:43	jesse	that really sucks dude. I've been messing with my raspberry pi and playing the 2nd south park game xD 
2018-03-23 18:24:53	gjabell	XD nice 
2018-03-23 18:25:08	gjabell	Now I finally get to get the server running lol 
2018-03-23 18:25:30	jesse	its pretty hard to ssh into it without the ethernet.
2018-03-23 18:25:30		can I see??!! 
2018-03-23 18:25:55	gjabell	Hmm yeah I'd imagine so xD 
2018-03-23 18:26:14	gjabell	Sure, I need to go grab a package from tower, I can meet you if you want 
2018-03-23 18:26:34	jesse	yea sure 
2018-03-23 18:26:40	gjabell	Kk 
2018-03-23 20:37:20	jesse	hey Galen, there was one more thing i forgot to ask, do you remember what you proposed in English 331 for the final essay thing? 
2018-03-23 20:37:52	gjabell	yeah, it was an android app for a fake garmin product xD 
2018-03-23 20:40:28	jesse	lol nice. I wanted to do propose something related to my research job, so I dont have to make up a scenario... but I wouldnt know what. maybe some feature for the webpage or something. 
2018-03-23 20:40:48	jesse	maybe the insurance function that I cringed about. 
2018-03-23 20:41:00	gjabell	could be 
2018-03-23 20:41:06	gjabell	it can be fairly small, whatever it is 
2018-03-23 20:41:13	gjabell	as long as you can go into detail about it 
2018-03-23 20:41:30	gjabell	I originally was going to go with a whole home automation system thing and she was like 'that's way too much' 
2018-03-23 20:41:41	gjabell	so I just pretended I was going to make an app for interacting with it instead 
2018-03-23 20:41:56	gjabell	and just went into a lot of detail in terms of the backend, database, frontend, etc. 
2018-03-23 20:42:39	jesse	lol but she wouldn't know if it's too much 
2018-03-23 20:43:07	gjabell	right, but the nice thing about doing comp sci stuff is that yoiu can basically make up bs and she won't know the difference 
2018-03-23 20:43:28	jesse	true. 
2018-03-24 18:01:24	jesse	have you looked into steganography? it's kinda neat. 
2018-03-24 18:03:20	jesse	i wonder if anyones found a way to hide a video inside another video. 
2018-03-24 18:25:41	gjabell	No, what is it? 
2018-03-24 18:26:28	jesse	hiding messages in pictures and stuff like that... but i think it would be cooler if you hid a picture in a picture or a video inside a video :P 
2018-03-24 18:26:35	gjabell	Huh 
2018-03-24 18:26:50	gjabell	Yeah that'd be neat xD 
2018-03-24 19:25:42	jesse	@jesse uploaded a file: https://sturgill-operators.slack.com/files/U3VPX29FW/F9V2VA0RF/togalen.jpg (toGalen) 
2018-03-24 20:25:26	jesse	@jesse uploaded a file: https://sturgill-operators.slack.com/files/U3VPX29FW/F9WE7AMP0/pandainsidepanda.jpg (pandainsidepanda) 
2018-03-24 22:24:36	gjabell	Lol 
2018-03-24 23:02:01	jesse	there are messages in those pics btw. 
2018-03-26 09:08:21	jesse	did you hear anything back from the hard drive people? 
2018-03-26 09:08:52	gjabell	I sent in an RMA request, so now I just have to ship them 
2018-03-26 09:09:00	gjabell	I think I won't know what the verdict is until they RMA them tho 
2018-03-26 09:09:05	gjabell	so fingers crossed xD 
2018-03-26 09:11:17	jesse	good luck dude.  
2018-03-26 09:11:31	gjabell	thanks 
2018-03-26 09:11:44	gjabell	everything else seems to be working so far, I just haven't set up much yet 
2018-03-26 09:11:50	gjabell	still need to figure out networking and all that 
2018-03-26 09:14:03	jesse	Hopefully using the wrong end of the ethernet cord wont fry your network adapters. 
2018-03-26 09:14:42	jesse	btw, in that picture of the panda I sent ya, there was another panda. 
2018-03-26 09:14:51	gjabell	lol yeah xD 
2018-03-26 09:14:57	gjabell	hmm, I didn't see it haha 
2018-03-26 09:15:00	gjabell	let me look again 
2018-03-26 09:15:50	jesse	you wouldn't see it. its using the least significant bits of the file to store the other panda... you'd need something like 'steghide' to extract it 
2018-03-26 09:15:57	gjabell	ohh 
2018-03-26 09:16:00	gjabell	ok that would make sense lol 
2018-03-26 09:16:17	jesse	but it is funny to imagine you just staring at a picture of a panda for hours 
2018-03-26 09:16:58	gjabell	I may have spent a bit too long trying to figure out what the message was xD 
2018-03-26 09:17:55	jesse	hahaha 
2018-03-26 09:20:49	jesse	I sent some pandas to some of my other friends but I wasn't being discrete at all... but they still ended up staring at the panda for a long time. 
2018-03-26 09:22:23	jesse	Even with sending the max file-size, I still didn't notice a difference in the pandas. i was hoping it would start to look pixelated or something. 
2018-03-26 09:29:06	gjabell	lol 
2018-03-28 14:40:13		getting channel history...
2018-03-23 09:54:49	gjabell	ofc if you really want it to be secure, you need to utilize a public/private key exchange to properly encryp the conversation 
2018-03-23 09:56:04	jesse	alcohol is a good way to encrypt data 
2018-03-23 09:56:40	gjabell	lol xD 
2018-03-23 10:17:19	jesse	btw, can you spy on my facebook account? xD 
2018-03-23 10:35:12	gjabell	like just go to it? 
2018-03-23 10:36:08	gjabell	yeah pretty sure it's invisible now 
2018-03-23 10:36:23	gjabell	I can't search for it through the default interface or my friends list 
2018-03-23 10:36:44	gjabell	looks like I can'

2018-03-23 14:11:20	gjabell	Yep 
2018-03-23 14:11:26	gjabell	It isn't started, which is bad lol 
2018-03-23 14:11:43	jesse	want some help? I'm pretty bored 
2018-03-23 14:12:01	jesse	I'm not knowledgble in servrs tho 
2018-03-23 14:12:21	gjabell	I actually have to go to a doctors appointment in about 15 min but you're welcome to come by afterwards 
2018-03-23 14:12:41	jesse	oki. whats the doctors appointment for? 
2018-03-23 14:12:53	gjabell	It's a post op for my eye lol 
2018-03-23 14:13:03	gjabell	Like a 3 month checkup thing 
2018-03-23 14:13:19	jesse	what did you to your eye? 
2018-03-23 14:13:30	jesse	what was the op? 
2018-03-23 14:14:11	gjabell	I had a small surgery done back in december 
2018-03-23 14:14:17	gjabell	For keratakonus 
2018-03-23 14:16:01	gjabell	Well, server finally turned on, which is good BC it hopefully means everything I'd OK xD but idk why it wasn't working before lol 
2018-03-23 14:16:45	jesse	keratakonus sounds bad. 
2018-03-23 14:17:12	gjabell	I'll explain it when I get back xD
2018-03-23 14:17:12		It sounds worse than it is haha 
2018-03-23 14:17:18	jesse	ok 
2018-03-23 14:17:23	jesse	is it rare? 
2018-03-23 14:17:55	gjabell	About 1 in 10000 I think 
2018-03-23 14:18:21	jesse	i wonder if itll show up on the website my research is making 
2018-03-23 14:19:56	jesse	unless you spelled it wrong, it is not on our webpage :( 
2018-03-23 14:20:56	gjabell	It's entirely possible I did
2018-03-23 14:20:56		Although I'd be pretty surprised if it were xD 
2018-03-23 14:39:18	jesse	actually we do have stuff on that disease. or at least, maybe rarer forms of that disease 
2018-03-23 14:40:14	gjabell	Lol 
2018-03-23 15:50:50	jesse	did ya get back from your eye doc? 
2018-03-23 15:51:10	gjabell	Still waiting for them to see me :( (no pun intended) 
2018-03-23 15:51:31	gjabell	It's in Durham too, so I'll probably be back around 5 or maybe 530 
2018-03-23 15:51:38	gjabell	Depending how long I have to wait 
2018-03-23 15:52:50	jesse	xD thats a good  intended pun 
2018-03-23 18:22:06	gjabell	Whelp, I have finally returned, after a long and arduous process xD 
2018-03-23 18:22:52	jesse	that sounds awful.  how the heck did that take 4 hours?! 
2018-03-23 18:23:55	gjabell	They were slow and it took me an hour to get back :( 
2018-03-23 18:24:00	gjabell	It was in durham 
2018-03-23 18:24:43	jesse	that really sucks dude. I've been messing with my raspberry pi and playing the 2nd south park game xD 
2018-03-23 18:24:53	gjabell	XD nice 
2018-03-23 18:25:08	gjabell	Now I finally get to get the server running lol 
2018-03-23 18:25:30	jesse	its pretty hard to ssh into it without the ethernet.
2018-03-23 18:25:30		can I see??!! 
2018-03-23 18:25:55	gjabell	Hmm yeah I'd imagine so xD 
2018-03-23 18:26:14	gjabell	Sure, I need to go grab a package from tower, I can meet you if you want 
2018-03-23 18:26:34	jesse	yea sure 
2018-03-23 18:26:40	gjabell	Kk 
2018-03-23 20:37:20	jesse	hey Galen, there was one more thing i forgot to ask, do you remember what you proposed in English 331 for the final essay thing? 
2018-03-23 20:37:52	gjabell	yeah, it was an android app for a fake garmin product xD 
2018-03-23 20:40:28	jesse	lol nice. I wanted to do propose something related to my research job, so I dont have to make up a scenario... but I wouldnt know what. maybe some feature for the webpage or something. 
2018-03-23 20:40:48	jesse	maybe the insurance function that I cringed about. 
2018-03-23 20:41:00	gjabell	could be 
2018-03-23 20:41:06	gjabell	it can be fairly small, whatever it is 
2018-03-23 20:41:13	gjabell	as long as you can go into detail about it 
2018-03-23 20:41:30	gjabell	I originally was going to go with a whole home automation system thing and she was like 'that's way too much' 
2018-03-23 20:41:41	gjabell	so I just pretended I was going to make an app for interacting with it instead 
2018-03-23 20:41:56	gjabell	and just went into a lot of detail in terms of the backend, database, frontend, etc. 
2018-03-23 20:42:39	jesse	lol but she wouldn't know if it's too much 
2018-03-23 20:43:07	gjabell	right, but the nice thing about doing comp sci stuff is that yoiu can basically make up bs and she won't know the difference 
2018-03-23 20:43:28	jesse	true. 
2018-03-24 18:01:24	jesse	have you looked into steganography? it's kinda neat. 
2018-03-24 18:03:20	jesse	i wonder if anyones found a way to hide a video inside another video. 
2018-03-24 18:25:41	gjabell	No, what is it? 
2018-03-24 18:26:28	jesse	hiding messages in pictures and stuff like that... but i think it would be cooler if you hid a picture in a picture or a video inside a video :P 
2018-03-24 18:26:35	gjabell	Huh 
2018-03-24 18:26:50	gjabell	Yeah that'd be neat xD 
2018-03-24 19:25:42	jesse	@jesse uploaded a file: https://sturgill-operators.slack.com/files/U3VPX29FW/F9V2VA0RF/togalen.jpg (toGalen) 
2018-03-24 20:25:26	jesse	@jesse uploaded a file: https://sturgill-operators.slack.com/files/U3VPX29FW/F9WE7AMP0/pandainsidepanda.jpg (pandainsidepanda) 
2018-03-24 22:24:36	gjabell	Lol 
2018-03-24 23:02:01	jesse	there are messages in those pics btw. 
2018-03-26 09:08:21	jesse	did you hear anything back from the hard drive people? 
2018-03-26 09:08:52	gjabell	I sent in an RMA request, so now I just have to ship them 
2018-03-26 09:09:00	gjabell	I think I won't know what the verdict is until they RMA them tho 
2018-03-26 09:09:05	gjabell	so fingers crossed xD 
2018-03-26 09:11:17	jesse	good luck dude.  
2018-03-26 09:11:31	gjabell	thanks 
2018-03-26 09:11:44	gjabell	everything else seems to be working so far, I just haven't set up much yet 
2018-03-26 09:11:50	gjabell	still need to figure out networking and all that 
2018-03-26 09:14:03	jesse	Hopefully using the wrong end of the ethernet cord wont fry your network adapters. 
2018-03-26 09:14:42	jesse	btw, in that picture of the panda I sent ya, there was another panda. 
2018-03-26 09:14:51	gjabell	lol yeah xD 
2018-03-26 09:14:57	gjabell	hmm, I didn't see it haha 
2018-03-26 09:15:00	gjabell	let me look again 
2018-03-26 09:15:50	jesse	you wouldn't see it. its using the least significant bits of the file to store the other panda... you'd need something like 'steghide' to extract it 
2018-03-26 09:15:57	gjabell	ohh 
2018-03-26 09:16:00	gjabell	ok that would make sense lol 
2018-03-26 09:16:17	jesse	but it is funny to imagine you just staring at a picture of a panda for hours 
2018-03-26 09:16:58	gjabell	I may have spent a bit too long trying to figure out what the message was xD 
2018-03-26 09:17:55	jesse	hahaha 
2018-03-26 09:20:49	jesse	I sent some pandas to some of my other friends but I wasn't being discrete at all... but they still ended up staring at the panda for a long time. 
2018-03-26 09:22:23	jesse	Even with sending the max file-size, I still didn't notice a difference in the pandas. i was hoping it would start to look pixelated or something. 
2018-03-26 09:29:06	gjabell	lol 
2018-03-26 10:07:29	gjabell	you've taken PH205 right? 
2018-03-26 10:07:37	gjabell	PHI* 
2018-03-26 10:08:09	jesse	I'm taking it this semester 
2018-03-26 10:08:14	gjabell	ah 
2018-03-26 10:08:18	gjabell	any idea how the online is? 
2018-03-26 10:08:51	jesse	no but take it in class with Eric Carter. the lectures might as well be optional, but i go anyway 
2018-03-26 10:09:07	gjabell	hmm alright, I'll see if it fits my schedule 
2018-03-26 10:10:10	gjabell	I th ink I have a class during that time but I'm not sure yet 
2018-03-26 10:10:58	jesse	PHI 340 is also pretty easy. I'm taking that online too. just 3 tests and the final is optional. im takin it pass fail cuz its only for my free electives category. 
2018-03-26 10:11:13	jesse	it can fit humanity tho 
2018-03-26 10:12:28	jesse	I'm gonna be taking the 2nd test today 
2018-03-26 10:12:36	gjabell	ah 
2018-03-26 10:12:50	gjabell	I might take AFS 240 online, it looks prtetty easy too 
2018-03-26 10:13:43	jesse	what's that? 
2018-03-26 10:14:10	gjabell	african civilizations lol 
2018-03-26 10:14:20	gjabell	the issue is that none of the humanities look interesting to me 
2018-03-26 10:14:23	gjabell	and since I can' 
2018-03-26 10:14:31	gjabell	t double up on german ones I need a second 
2018-03-26 10:15:32	gjabell	so mostly looking for one that's super easy w/ no work, pref online lol 
2018-03-26 10:15:42	jesse	phi 340 would be easy. its kinda irritating, but the only work is the 3 tests and optional final. no video lectures btw, just readings. 
2018-03-26 10:15:55	gjabell	hmm 
2018-03-26 10:15:56	jesse	and I havent done any of the readings for this test 
2018-03-26 10:15:57	gjabell	that might not be too bad 
2018-03-26 10:16:02	gjabell	lol 
2018-03-26 10:16:06	gjabell	why is it irritating? 
2018-03-26 10:24:19	jesse	also we have "microquizzes" each monday/wednesday that is basically 1 exam question. its kinda negligible to our grade with how the grading is set up. Before the first test, I read all of the required readings and tried on all of the micro quizzes. 
2018-03-26 10:24:19		the questions are completely bananas. you may find direct quotes in the text that supports your answer and it could still be marked wrong. The class content is annoying because its about identifying pseudoscience... and the whole class is pseudoscience. there is no data presented to support their claims and there are no concrete definitions for any terms mentioned... and google doesnt help much because these terms are made up.
2018-03-26 10:24:19		but then I stopped doing the readings and taking the class seriously, and I can appreciate how easy/nonsense it is :) . I was also given a notebook from a friend who took the class. and im taking it pass fail so it doesnt matter how i do on the tests. if I do well enough on this test, I might not even have to take the 3rd one. 
2018-03-26 10:25:47	gjabell	xD 
2018-03-26 10:25:51	gjabell	sounds like kind of a pain lol 
2018-03-26 10:25:53	jesse	my recommendation could change depending on how this test goes lol. 
2018-03-26 10:25:59	gjabell	fai 
2018-03-26 10:26:01	gjabell	fair* 
2018-03-26 10:27:44	jesse	it is a pain if you take it seriously... so my advice would be to not take it seriously. just get the easy A and play video games  or something.. 
2018-03-26 10:28:06	gjabell	I could totally roll with that lol 
2018-03-26 10:28:10	jesse	and stress yourself out when the tests roll around 
2018-03-26 10:28:17	gjabell	altho it sounds like maybe it isn't that easy to get an A if nothing makes sense lol 
2018-03-26 10:29:38	jesse	fair point. lets say that its an easy B and if you want an A, consider taking the optional final to replace your lowest test grade. 
2018-03-26 10:29:54	gjabell	if it's that easy for a B I'm def interested lol 
2018-03-26 10:30:02	gjabell	I just want a humanities that I don't have to work for lol 
2018-03-26 10:31:27	jesse	but remember, you cant take it seriously. you have to take it as if youre Daniel and just get drunk before you start a reading xD 
2018-03-26 10:31:33	gjabell	loool 
2018-03-26 10:33:41	jesse	xD i miss that dude. he was funny. 
2018-03-26 10:34:09	gjabell	yeah, I haven't seen him much this semester 
2018-03-26 14:31:44	jesse	2nd test took me and my partner 3 hours. about half of the questions overlapped so working with him made the amount of work higher.
2018-03-26 14:31:44		anyway, it was a pain, and I wont know my grade till tomorrow. 
2018-03-26 14:32:04	gjabell	Rip 
2018-03-26 14:32:09	gjabell	Let me know how it goes lol 
2018-03-26 14:32:17	jesse	yup 
2018-03-28 14:41:25	jesse	I'm starting to use the command line tool timetrap to log my time working on work/school/fun stuff. If you're into gathering sort of data, you should check it out. it's a gem. 
2018-03-28 14:56:31		getting channel history...
2018-03-23 10:17:19	jesse	btw, can you spy on my facebook account? xD 
2018-03-23 10:35:12	gjabell	like just go to it? 
2018-03-23 10:36:08	gjabell	yeah pretty sure it's invisible now 
2018-03-23 10:36:23	gjabell	I can't search for it through the default interface or my friends list 
2018-03-23 10:36:44	gjabell	looks like I can' 
2018-03-23 10:36:48	gjabell	t even tag you 
2018-03-23 10:39:30	jesse	alright. That's good enough for me xD. I'm not much of a privacy nut, I'd honestly just rather people not contact me if they are out of my life. 
2018-03-23 10:39:32	jesse	Thanks 
2018-03-23 10:39:37	gjabell	yeah that's fair 
2018-03-23 10:39:43	gjabell	kinda want to do that on mine too lol 
2018-03-23 10:40:07	gjabell	although I don't even use facebook most of the time so idk if there's anything I care about people seeing on it xD 
2018-03-23 10:40:48	jesse	Do it. I'll activate my facebook to check if your facebook account has been deactivated... but then youll have to activate your fb account to check if my account is deactivated...  
2018-03-23 10:41:05	gjabell	hmm... 
2018-03-23 10:41:27	gjabell	how do you even do it 
2018-03-23 10:42:10	jesse	Account Settings > General > Account Settings I think 
2018-03-23 10:42:17	jesse	wait... 
2018-03-23 10:42:21	gjabell	ah 
2018-03-23 10:42:22	jesse	i got that messed up haha 
2018-03-23 10:42:23	gjabell	manage account 
2018-03-23 10:44:36	gjabell	sayonara facebook 
2018-03-23 10:45:41	jesse	Stallman still doesn't approve unless we harass them to delete all of our data off their database. xD 
2018-03-23 10:46:00	gjabell	what the shit 
2018-03-23 10:46:21	gjabell	it forced me to log back into messenger and that reactivated facebook 
2018-03-23 10:46:39	gjabell	god dammit 
2018-03-23 10:46:46	jesse	Oh, theres an option below log-back-in where you just input your phone number 
2018-03-23 10:46:47	gjabell	I guess it's only messenger and not messenger lite that works 
2018-03-23 10:47:14	gjabell	which blows, because messenger sucks cock 
2018-03-23 10:48:52	gjabell	which interestingly probably tells us that the messenger lite app is just a wrapper around their web ui 
2018-03-23 10:50:11	jesse	nah theres a place you can just put in your phone number and it logs you in as if you had a facebook account.. your deactivated fb account may need your phone number. idk 
2018-03-23 10:50:29	gjabell	that's what I did on lite 
2018-03-23 10:50:33	gjabell	are you using lite or default? 
2018-03-23 10:51:14	jesse	the regular one 
2018-03-23 10:51:22	jesse	ill download lite to check it 
2018-03-23 10:52:25	jesse	it doesn't look like lite has those options. 
2018-03-23 10:52:29	gjabell	fuck me, did it again 
2018-03-23 10:52:45	gjabell	where is the option? 
2018-03-23 10:52:52	jesse	on the regular one? 
2018-03-23 10:52:59	gjabell	yea 
2018-03-23 10:54:09	jesse	ill look into it. im gonna reinstall the regular one. 
2018-03-23 10:54:17	gjabell	k 
2018-03-23 10:57:29	jesse	So when I did it, it showed up a popup that said I could continue using messenger without my facebook account. I can head over to your apartment to show/help ya if ya want. 
2018-03-23 10:57:48	gjabell	hmm 
2018-03-23 10:57:52	gjabell	sure, why not xD 
2018-03-23 10:58:02	gjabell	let me brush my teeth first tho, give me 5 or so 
2018-03-23 10:59:06	jesse	Same. 
2018-03-23 10:59:28	gjabell	oh 
2018-03-23 10:59:35	gjabell	there we go, I got the message too 
2018-03-23 10:59:39	gjabell	weird that I didn't get it before 
2018-03-23 11:07:36	jesse	still want me to come over or nah? 
2018-03-23 11:07:55	gjabell	up to you, I'm always down to chat about random computer stuff xD 
2018-03-23 11:08:25	gjabell	I have to go sell someone a mobo around 1140 tho so unless you're really bored and want to come with we won't be able to hang out for very long lol 
2018-03-23 11:09:01	gjabell	actually might be more like 1130, cause I need gas too 
2018-03-23 11:09:54	jesse	what's a mobo? 
2018-03-23 11:09:58	gjabell	motherboard 
2018-03-23 11:10:04	gjabell	for a computer 
2018-03-23 11:10:22	jesse	lol i know what motherboards are for haha 
2018-03-23 11:10:27	gjabell	ok just makign sure xD 
2018-03-23 11:11:16	gjabell	then I'm buying some ram, so I cna complete my server xD 
2018-03-23 11:12:18	jesse	I'm probably gonna go to the grocery store with my roommate around 12. maybe ill visit later today. 
2018-03-23 11:12:36	gjabell	sounds like a plan 
2018-03-23 11:12:47	gjabell	I'll hopefully be back here around 1 or so 
2018-03-23 11:13:34	jesse	same 
2018-03-23 13:18:38	jesse	i think they have free chipoltle either on the oval or at the cistern. are you going to that? 
2018-03-23 13:19:21	gjabell	Prollt not lol, wanna get the server up and running xD 
2018-03-23 13:19:29	jesse	XD 
2018-03-23 14:10:19	jesse	still workin on your server? 
2018-03-23 14:11:20	gjabell	Yep 
2018-03-23 14:11:26	gjabell	It isn't started, which is bad lol 
2018-03-23 14:11:43	jesse	want some help? I'm pretty bored 
2018-03-23 14:12:01	jesse	I'm not knowledgble in servrs tho 
2018-03-23 14:12:21	gjabell	I actually have to go to a doctors appointment in about 15 min but you're welcome to come by afterwards 
2018-03-23 14:12:41	jesse	oki. whats the doctors appointment for? 
2018-03-23 14:12:53	gjabell	It's a post op for my eye lol 
2018-03-23 14:13:03	gjabell	Like a 3 month checkup thing 
2018-03-23 14:13:19	jesse	what did you to your eye? 
2018-03-23 14:13:30	jesse	what was the op? 
2018-03-23 14:14:11	gjabell	I had a small surgery done back in december 
2018-03-23 14:14:17	gjabell	For keratakonus 
2018-03-23 14:16:01	gjabell	Well, server finally turned on, which is good BC it hopefully means everything I'd OK xD but idk why it wasn't working before lol 
2018-03-23 14:16:45	jesse	keratakonus sounds bad. 
2018-03-23 14:17:12	gjabell	I'll explain it when I get back xD
2018-03-23 14:17:12		It sounds worse than it is haha 
2018-03-23 14:17:18	jesse	ok 
2018-03-23 14:17:23	jesse	is it rare? 
2018-03-23 14:17:55	gjabell	About 1 in 10000 I think 
2018-03-23 14:18:21	jesse	i wonder if itll show up on the website my research is making 
2018-03-23 14:19:56	jesse	unless you spelled it wrong, it is not on our webpage :( 
2018-03-23 14:20:56	gjabell	It's entirely possible I did
2018-03-23 14:20:56		Although I'd be pretty surprised if it were xD 
2018-03-23 14:39:18	jesse	actually we do have stuff on that disease. or at least, maybe rarer forms of that disease 
2018-03-23 14:40:14	gjabell	Lol 
2018-03-23 15:50:50	jesse	did ya get back from your eye doc? 
2018-03-23 15:51:10	gjabell	Still waiting for them to see me :( (no pun intended) 
2018-03-23 15:51:31	gjabell	It's in Durham too, so I'll probably be back around 5 or maybe 530 
2018-03-23 15:51:38	gjabell	Depending how long I have to wait 
2018-03-23 15:52:50	jesse	xD thats a good  intended pun 
2018-03-23 18:22:06	gjabell	Whelp, I have finally returned, after a long and arduous process xD 
2018-03-23 18:22:52	jesse	that sounds awful.  how the heck did that take 4 hours?! 
2018-03-23 18:23:55	gjabell	They were slow and it took me an hour to get back :( 
2018-03-23 18:24:00	gjabell	It was in durham 
2018-03-23 18:24:43	jesse	that really sucks dude. I've been messing with my raspberry pi and playing the 2nd south park game xD 
2018-03-23 18:24:53	gjabell	XD nice 
2018-03-23 18:25:08	gjabell	Now I finally get to get the server running lol 
2018-03-23 18:25:30	jesse	its pretty hard to ssh into it without the ethernet.
2018-03-23 18:25:30		can I see??!! 
2018-03-23 18:25:55	gjabell	Hmm yeah I'd imagine so xD 
2018-03-23 18:26:14	gjabell	Sure, I need to go grab a package from tower, I can meet you if you want 
2018-03-23 18:26:34	jesse	yea sure 
2018-03-23 18:26:40	gjabell	Kk 
2018-03-23 20:37:20	jesse	hey Galen, there was one more thing i forgot to ask, do you remember what you proposed in English 331 for the final essay thing? 
2018-03-23 20:37:52	gjabell	yeah, it was an android app for a fake garmin product xD 
2018-03-23 20:40:28	jesse	lol nice. I wanted to do propose something related to my research job, so I dont have to make up a scenario... but I wouldnt know what. maybe some feature for the webpage or something. 
2018-03-23 20:40:48	jesse	maybe the insurance function that I cringed about. 
2018-03-23 20:41:00	gjabell	could be 
2018-03-23 20:41:06	gjabell	it can be fairly small, whatever it is 
2018-03-23 20:41:13	gjabell	as long as you can go into detail about it 
2018-03-23 20:41:30	gjabell	I originally was going to go with a whole home automation system thing and she was like 'that's way too much' 
2018-03-23 20:41:41	gjabell	so I just pretended I was going to make an app for interacting with it instead 
2018-03-23 20:41:56	gjabell	and just went into a lot of detail in terms of the backend, database, frontend, etc. 
2018-03-23 20:42:39	jesse	lol but she wouldn't know if it's too much 
2018-03-23 20:43:07	gjabell	right, but the nice thing about doing comp sci stuff is that yoiu can basically make up bs and she won't know the difference 
2018-03-23 20:43:28	jesse	true. 
2018-03-24 18:01:24	jesse	have you looked into steganography? it's kinda neat. 
2018-03-24 18:03:20	jesse	i wonder if anyones found a way to hide a video inside another video. 
2018-03-24 18:25:41	gjabell	No, what is it? 
2018-03-24 18:26:28	jesse	hiding messages in pictures and stuff like that... but i think it would be cooler if you hid a picture in a picture or a video inside a video :P 
2018-03-24 18:26:35	gjabell	Huh 
2018-03-24 18:26:50	gjabell	Yeah that'd be neat xD 
2018-03-24 19:25:42	jesse	@jesse uploaded a file: https://sturgill-operators.slack.com/files/U3VPX29FW/F9V2VA0RF/togalen.jpg (toGalen) 
2018-03-24 20:25:26	jesse	@jesse uploaded a file: https://sturgill-operators.slack.com/files/U3VPX29FW/F9WE7AMP0/pandainsidepanda.jpg (pandainsidepanda) 
2018-03-24 22:24:36	gjabell	Lol 
2018-03-24 23:02:01	jesse	there are messages in those pics btw. 
2018-03-26 09:08:21	jesse	did you hear anything back from the hard drive people? 
2018-03-26 09:08:52	gjabell	I sent in an RMA request, so now I just have to ship them 
2018-03-26 09:09:00	gjabell	I think I won't know what the verdict is until they RMA them tho 
2018-03-26 09:09:05	gjabell	so fingers crossed xD 
2018-03-26 09:11:17	jesse	good luck dude.  
2018-03-26 09:11:31	gjabell	thanks 
2018-03-26 09:11:44	gjabell	everything else seems to be working so far, I just haven't set up much yet 
2018-03-26 09:11:50	gjabell	still need to figure out networking and all that 
2018-03-26 09:14:03	jesse	Hopefully using the wrong end of the ethernet cord wont fry your network adapters. 
2018-03-26 09:14:42	jesse	btw, in that picture of the panda I sent ya, there was another panda. 
2018-03-26 09:14:51	gjabell	lol yeah xD 
2018-03-26 09:14:57	gjabell	hmm, I didn't see it haha 
2018-03-26 09:15:00	gjabell	let me look again 
2018-03-26 09:15:50	jesse	you wouldn't see it. its using the least significant bits of the file to store the other panda... you'd need something like 'steghide' to extract it 
2018-03-26 09:15:57	gjabell	ohh 
2018-03-26 09:16:00	gjabell	ok that would make sense lol 
2018-03-26 09:16:17	jesse	but it is funny to imagine you just staring at a picture of a panda for hours 
2018-03-26 09:16:58	gjabell	I may have spent a bit too long trying to figure out what the message was xD 
2018-03-26 09:17:55	jesse	hahaha 
2018-03-26 09:20:49	jesse	I sent some pandas to some of my other friends but I wasn't being discrete at all... but they still ended up staring at the panda for a long time. 
2018-03-26 09:22:23	jesse	Even with sending the max file-size, I still didn't notice a difference in the pandas. i was hoping it would start to look pixelated or something. 
2018-03-26 09:29:06	gjabell	lol 
2018-03-26 10:07:29	gjabell	you've taken PH205 right? 
2018-03-26 10:07:37	gjabell	PHI* 
2018-03-26 10:08:09	jesse	I'm taking it this semester 
2018-03-26 10:08:14	gjabell	ah 
2018-03-26 10:08:18	gjabell	any idea how the online is? 
2018-03-26 10:08:51	jesse	no but take it in class with Eric Carter. the lectures might as well be optional, but i go anyway 
2018-03-26 10:09:07	gjabell	hmm alright, I'll see if it fits my schedule 
2018-03-26 10:10:10	gjabell	I th ink I have a class during that time but I'm not sure yet 
2018-03-26 10:10:58	jesse	PHI 340 is also pretty easy. I'm taking that online too. just 3 tests and the final is optional. im takin it pass fail cuz its only for my free electives category. 
2018-03-26 10:11:13	jesse	it can fit humanity tho 
2018-03-26 10:12:28	jesse	I'm gonna be taking the 2nd test today 
2018-03-26 10:12:36	gjabell	ah 
2018-03-26 10:12:50	gjabell	I might take AFS 240 online, it looks prtetty easy too 
2018-03-26 10:13:43	jesse	what's that? 
2018-03-26 10:14:10	gjabell	african civilizations lol 
2018-03-26 10:14:20	gjabell	the issue is that none of the humanities look interesting to me 
2018-03-26 10:14:23	gjabell	and since I can' 
2018-03-26 10:14:31	gjabell	t double up on german ones I need a second 
2018-03-26 10:15:32	gjabell	so mostly looking for one that's super easy w/ no work, pref online lol 
2018-03-26 10:15:42	jesse	phi 340 would be easy. its kinda irritating, but the only work is the 3 tests and optional final. no video lectures btw, just readings. 
2018-03-26 10:15:55	gjabell	hmm 
2018-03-26 10:15:56	jesse	and I havent done any of the readings for this test 
2018-03-26 10:15:57	gjabell	that might not be too bad 
2018-03-26 10:16:02	gjabell	lol 
2018-03-26 10:16:06	gjabell	why is it irritating? 
2018-03-26 10:24:19	jesse	also we have "microquizzes" each monday/wednesday that is basically 1 exam question. its kinda negligible to our grade with how the grading is set up. Before the first test, I read all of the required readings and tried on all of the micro quizzes. 
2018-03-26 10:24:19		the questions are completely bananas. you may find direct quotes in the text that supports your answer and it could still be marked wrong. The class content is annoying because its about identifying pseudoscience... and the whole class is pseudoscience. there is no data presented to support their claims and there are no concrete definitions for any terms mentioned... and google doesnt help much because these terms are made up.
2018-03-26 10:24:19		but then I stopped doing the readings and taking the class seriously, and I can appreciate how easy/nonsense it is :) . I was also given a notebook from a friend who took the class. and im taking it pass fail so it doesnt matter how i do on the tests. if I do well enough on this test, I might not even have to take the 3rd one. 
2018-03-26 10:25:47	gjabell	xD 
2018-03-26 10:25:51	gjabell	sounds like kind of a pain lol 
2018-03-26 10:25:53	jesse	my recommendation could change depending on how this test goes lol. 
2018-03-26 10:25:59	gjabell	fai 
2018-03-26 10:26:01	gjabell	fair* 
2018-03-26 10:27:44	jesse	it is a pain if you take it seriously... so my advice would be to not take it seriously. just get the easy A and play video games  or something.. 
2018-03-26 10:28:06	gjabell	I could totally roll with that lol 
2018-03-26 10:28:10	jesse	and stress yourself out when the tests roll around 
2018-03-26 10:28:17	gjabell	altho it sounds like maybe it isn't that easy to get an A if nothing makes sense lol 
2018-03-26 10:29:38	jesse	fair point. lets say that its an easy B and if you want an A, consider taking the optional final to replace your lowest test grade. 
2018-03-26 10:29:54	gjabell	if it's that easy for a B I'm def interested lol 
2018-03-26 10:30:02	gjabell	I just want a humanities that I don't have to work for lol 
2018-03-26 10:31:27	jesse	but remember, you cant take it seriously. you have to take it as if youre Daniel and just get drunk before you start a reading xD 
2018-03-26 10:31:33	gjabell	loool 
2018-03-26 10:33:41	jesse	xD i miss that dude. he was funny. 
2018-03-26 10:34:09	gjabell	yeah, I haven't seen him much this semester 
2018-03-26 14:31:44	jesse	2nd test took me and my partner 3 hours. about half of the questions overlapped so working with him made the amount of work higher.
2018-03-26 14:31:44		anyway, it was a pain, and I wont know my grade till tomorrow. 
2018-03-26 14:32:04	gjabell	Rip 
2018-03-26 14:32:09	gjabell	Let me know how it goes lol 
2018-03-26 14:32:17	jesse	yup 
2018-03-28 14:41:25	jesse	I'm starting to use the command line tool timetrap to log my time working on work/school/fun stuff. If you're into gathering sort of data, you should check it out. it's a gem. 
2018-03-28 14:47:18	jesse	as in the ruby package manager gem.. 
2018-03-28 14:47:35	gjabell	Huh
2018-03-28 14:47:35		Lol xD 
2018-03-28 14:56:51	jesse	have you heard good things about the cryptography class? 
2018-03-28 15:01:23	gjabell	I've heard it's the hardest comp sci class here 
2018-03-28 15:01:44	jesse	:( I heard it was fun. 
2018-03-28 15:02:58	gjabell	XD idk, might be
2018-03-28 15:02:58		I just don't want to take something I'm not sure I'll do well in 
2018-03-28 15:11:26	jesse	I'm a lil worried I won't get into the human computer interaction class (which I hear is stupid easy), so I'm looking for other csc restricted electives... I might just do my research for credit to fill that spot. 
2018-03-28 15:34:49	gjabell	Yeah that seems like a better idea lol 
2018-03-28 15:35:26	jesse	sadly, that meeting time would conflict with software security (the one class that semester that I actually want to take) 
2018-03-28 15:36:04	gjabell	Ah 
2018-03-28 15:36:08	gjabell	You could do net sec 
2018-03-28 15:37:03	jesse	and theres the problem of maybe not being able to do human computer interaction (its already full)... I'm considering cloud computing though. have you taken that? 
2018-03-28 15:37:41	gjabell	Yeah I'm in it atm 
2018-03-28 15:37:58	jesse	this semester? 
2018-03-28 15:38:16	gjabell	yep 
2018-03-28 15:38:20	jesse	how is it? 
2018-03-28 15:38:37	gjabell	honestly, really easy and pretty boring xD 
2018-03-28 15:38:55	gjabell	I was hoping it'd be more sysadmin stuff but it's more of a general overview of cloud computing 
2018-03-28 15:39:00	gjabell	and most of it is super explanatory 
2018-03-28 15:39:17	jesse	do you have projects? 
2018-03-28 15:39:22	gjabell	not that I'd be able to tell you how to actually set up a decent cloud system, but I wouldn't be able to tell you that if I were paying attention either 
2018-03-28 15:39:26	gjabell	yeah, they are also really easy lol 
2018-03-28 15:39:36	gjabell	basically just set up a VLC instance and take some screenshots 
2018-03-28 15:39:46	gjabell	if you want an easy class it's good, otherwise it's not great 
2018-03-28 15:40:04	jesse	well, i think id rather take that than compiler theory. 
2018-03-28 15:40:25	gjabell	probably yeah 
2018-03-28 15:40:40	gjabell	I like the professor, he's super smart and is genuinely excited about the subject 
2018-03-28 15:40:45	gjabell	it's just soooo boring to sit in class 
2018-03-28 15:41:41	jesse	well thats what I was expecting from Human computer interaction xD 
2018-03-28 15:41:47	gjabell	true 
2018-03-28 15:42:29	jesse	have you taken applied diff eq? 
2018-03-28 15:42:46	gjabell	nope 
2018-03-28 15:42:54	jesse	ok 
2018-03-28 15:43:36	jesse	thanks galen!! I now have a somewhat reasonable schedule. 
2018-03-28 15:43:51	gjabell	np xD 
2018-03-28 15:49:17	jesse	I guess I now have to question if I want to continue my research for pay xD... or do it for cred and drop soft security. its a lil frustrating i'll miss all the meetings if I do software security. :( 
2018-03-28 15:49:42	gjabell	hmm yeah that kinda sucks 
2018-03-29 21:33:49		getting channel history...
2018-03-23 14:12:53	gjabell	It's a post op for my eye lol 
2018-03-23 14:13:03	gjabell	Like a 3 month checkup thing 
2018-03-23 14:13:19	jesse	what did you to your eye? 
2018-03-23 14:13:30	jesse	what was the op? 
2018-03-23 14:14:11	gjabell	I had a small surgery done back in december 
2018-03-23 14:14:17	gjabell	For keratakonus 
2018-03-23 14:16:01	gjabell	Well, server finally turned on, which is good BC it hopefully means everything I'd OK xD but idk why it wasn't working before lol 
2018-03-23 14:16:45	jesse	keratakonus sounds bad. 
2018-03-23 14:17:12	gjabell	I'll explain it when I get back xD
2018-03-23 14:17:12		It sounds worse than it is haha 
2018-03-23 14:17:18	jesse	ok 
2018-03-23 14:17:23	jesse	is it rare? 
2018-03-23 14:17:55	gjabell	About 1 in 10000 I think 
2018-03-23 14:18:21	jesse	i wonder if itll show up on the website my research is making 
2018-03-23 14:19:56	jesse	unless you spelled it wrong, it is not on our webpage :( 
2018-03-23 14:20:56	gjabell	It's entirely possible I did
2018-03-23 14:20:56		Although I'd be pretty surprised if it were xD 
2018-03-23 14:39:18	jesse	actually we do have stuff on that disease. or at least, maybe rarer forms of that disease 
2018-03-23 14:40:14	gjabell	Lol 
2018-03-23 15:50:50	jesse	did ya get back from your eye doc? 
2018-03-23 15:51:10	gjabell	Still waiting for them to see me :( (no pun intended) 
2018-03-23 15:51:31	gjabell	It's in Durham too, so I'll probably be back around 5 or maybe 530 
2018-03-23 15:51:38	gjabell	Depending how long I have to wait 
2018-03-23 15:52:50	jesse	xD thats a good  intended pun 
2018-03-23 18:22:06	gjabell	Whelp, I have finally returned, after a long and arduous process xD 
2018-03-23 18:22:52	jesse	that sounds awful.  how the heck did that take 4 hours?! 
2018-03-23 18:23:55	gjabell	They were slow and it took me an hour to get back :( 
2018-03-23 18:24:00	gjabell	It was in durham 
2018-03-23 18:24:43	jesse	that really sucks dude. I've been messing with my raspberry pi and playing the 2nd south park game xD 
2018-03-23 18:24:53	gjabell	XD nice 
2018-03-23 18:25:08	gjabell	Now I finally get to get the server running lol 
2018-03-23 18:25:30	jesse	its pretty hard to ssh into it without the ethernet.
2018-03-23 18:25:30		can I see??!! 
2018-03-23 18:25:55	gjabell	Hmm yeah I'd imagine so xD 
2018-03-23 18:26:14	gjabell	Sure, I need to go grab a package from tower, I can meet you if you want 
2018-03-23 18:26:34	jesse	yea sure 
2018-03-23 18:26:40	gjabell	Kk 
2018-03-23 20:37:20	jesse	hey Galen, there was one more thing i forgot to ask, do you remember what you proposed in English 331 for the final essay thing? 
2018-03-23 20:37:52	gjabell	yeah, it was an android app for a fake garmin product xD 
2018-03-23 20:40:28	jesse	lol nice. I wanted to do propose something related to my research job, so I dont have to make up a scenario... but I wouldnt know what. maybe some feature for the webpage or something. 
2018-03-23 20:40:48	jesse	maybe the insurance function that I cringed about. 
2018-03-23 20:41:00	gjabell	could be 
2018-03-23 20:41:06	gjabell	it can be fairly small, whatever it is 
2018-03-23 20:41:13	gjabell	as long as you can go into detail about it 
2018-03-23 20:41:30	gjabell	I originally was going to go with a whole home automation system thing and she was like 'that's way too much' 
2018-03-23 20:41:41	gjabell	so I just pretended I was going to make an app for interacting with it instead 
2018-03-23 20:41:56	gjabell	and just went into a lot of detail in terms of the backend, database, frontend, etc. 
2018-03-23 20:42:39	jesse	lol but she wouldn't know if it's too much 
2018-03-23 20:43:07	gjabell	right, but the nice thing about doing comp sci stuff is that yoiu can basically make up bs and she won't know the difference 
2018-03-23 20:43:28	jesse	true. 
2018-03-24 18:01:24	jesse	have you looked into steganography? it's kinda neat. 
2018-03-24 18:03:20	jesse	i wonder if anyones found a way to hide a video inside another video. 
2018-03-24 18:25:41	gjabell	No, what is it? 
2018-03-24 18:26:28	jesse	hiding messages in pictures and stuff like that... but i think it would be cooler if you hid a picture in a picture or a video inside a video :P 
2018-03-24 18:26:35	gjabell	Huh 
2018-03-24 18:26:50	gjabell	Yeah that'd be neat xD

2018-03-24 22:24:36	gjabell	Lol 
2018-03-24 23:02:01	jesse	there are messages in those pics btw. 
2018-03-26 09:08:21	jesse	did you hear anything back from the hard drive people? 
2018-03-26 09:08:52	gjabell	I sent in an RMA request, so now I just have to ship them 
2018-03-26 09:09:00	gjabell	I think I won't know what the verdict is until they RMA them tho 
2018-03-26 09:09:05	gjabell	so fingers crossed xD 
2018-03-26 09:11:17	jesse	good luck dude.  
2018-03-26 09:11:31	gjabell	thanks 
2018-03-26 09:11:44	gjabell	everything else seems to be working so far, I just haven't set up much yet 
2018-03-26 09:11:50	gjabell	still need to figure out networking and all that 
2018-03-26 09:14:03	jesse	Hopefully using the wrong end of the ethernet cord wont fry your network adapters. 
2018-03-26 09:14:42	jesse	btw, in that picture of the panda I sent ya, there was another panda. 
2018-03-26 09:14:51	gjabell	lol yeah xD 
2018-03-26 09:14:57	gjabell	hmm, I didn't see it haha 
2018-03-26 09:15:00	gjabell	let me look again 
2018-03-26 09:15:50	jesse	you wouldn't see it. its using the least significant bits of the file to store the other panda... you'd need something like 'steghide' to extract it 
2018-03-26 09:15:57	gjabell	ohh 
2018-03-26 09:16:00	gjabell	ok that would make sense lol 
2018-03-26 09:16:17	jesse	but it is funny to imagine you just staring at a picture of a panda for hours 
2018-03-26 09:16:58	gjabell	I may have spent a bit too long trying to figure out what the message was xD 
2018-03-26 09:17:55	jesse	hahaha 
2018-03-26 09:20:49	jesse	I sent some pandas to some of my other friends but I wasn't being discrete at all... but they still ended up staring at the panda for a long time. 
2018-03-26 09:22:23	jesse	Even with sending the max file-size, I still didn't notice a difference in the pandas. i was hoping it would start to look pixelated or something. 
2018-03-26 09:29:06	gjabell	lol 
2018-03-26 10:07:29	gjabell	you've taken PH205 right? 
2018-03-26 10:07:37	gjabell	PHI* 
2018-03-26 10:08:09	jesse	I'm taking it this semester 
2018-03-26 10:08:14	gjabell	ah 
2018-03-26 10:08:18	gjabell	any idea how the online is? 
2018-03-26 10:08:51	jesse	no but take it in class with Eric Carter. the lectures might as well be optional, but i go anyway 
2018-03-26 10:09:07	gjabell	hmm alright, I'll see if it fits my schedule 
2018-03-26 10:10:10	gjabell	I th ink I have a class during that time but I'm not sure yet 
2018-03-26 10:10:58	jesse	PHI 340 is also pretty easy. I'm taking that online too. just 3 tests and the final is optional. im takin it pass fail cuz its only for my free electives category. 
2018-03-26 10:11:13	jesse	it can fit humanity tho 
2018-03-26 10:12:28	jesse	I'm gonna be taking the 2nd test today 
2018-03-26 10:12:36	gjabell	ah 
2018-03-26 10:12:50	gjabell	I might take AFS 240 online, it looks prtetty easy too 
2018-03-26 10:13:43	jesse	what's that? 
2018-03-26 10:14:10	gjabell	african civilizations lol 
2018-03-26 10:14:20	gjabell	the issue is that none of the humanities look interesting to me 
2018-03-26 10:14:23	gjabell	and since I can' 
2018-03-26 10:14:31	gjabell	t double up on german ones I need a second 
2018-03-26 10:15:32	gjabell	so mostly looking for one that's super easy w/ no work, pref online lol 
2018-03-26 10:15:42	jesse	phi 340 would be easy. its kinda irritating, but the only work is the 3 tests and optional final. no video lectures btw, just readings. 
2018-03-26 10:15:55	gjabell	hmm 
2018-03-26 10:15:56	jesse	and I havent done any of the readings for this test 
2018-03-26 10:15:57	gjabell	that might not be too bad 
2018-03-26 10:16:02	gjabell	lol 
2018-03-26 10:16:06	gjabell	why is it irritating? 
2018-03-26 10:24:19	jesse	also we have "microquizzes" each monday/wednesday that is basically 1 exam question. its kinda negligible to our grade with how the grading is set up. Before the first test, I read all of the required readings and tried on all of the micro quizzes. 
2018-03-26 10:24:19		the questions are completely bananas. you may find direct quotes in the text that supports your answer and it could still be marked wrong. The class content is annoying because its about identifying pseudoscience... and the whole class is pseudoscience. there is no data presented to support their claims and there are no concrete definitions for any terms mentioned... and google doesnt help much because these terms are made up.
2018-03-26 10:24:19		but then I stopped doing the readings and taking the class seriously, and I can appreciate how easy/nonsense it is :) . I was also given a notebook from a friend who took the class. and im taking it pass fail so it doesnt matter how i do on the tests. if I do well enough on this test, I might not even have to take the 3rd one. 
2018-03-26 10:25:47	gjabell	xD 
2018-03-26 10:25:51	gjabell	sounds like kind of a pain lol 
2018-03-26 10:25:53	jesse	my recommendation could change depending on how this test goes lol. 
2018-03-26 10:25:59	gjabell	fai 
2018-03-26 10:26:01	gjabell	fair* 
2018-03-26 10:27:44	jesse	it is a pain if you take it seriously... so my advice would be to not take it seriously. just get the easy A and play video games  or something.. 
2018-03-26 10:28:06	gjabell	I could totally roll with that lol 
2018-03-26 10:28:10	jesse	and stress yourself out when the tests roll around 
2018-03-26 10:28:17	gjabell	altho it sounds like maybe it isn't that easy to get an A if nothing makes sense lol 
2018-03-26 10:29:38	jesse	fair point. lets say that its an easy B and if you want an A, consider taking the optional final to replace your lowest test grade. 
2018-03-26 10:29:54	gjabell	if it's that easy for a B I'm def interested lol 
2018-03-26 10:30:02	gjabell	I just want a humanities that I don't have to work for lol 
2018-03-26 10:31:27	jesse	but remember, you cant take it seriously. you have to take it as if youre Daniel and just get drunk before you start a reading xD 
2018-03-26 10:31:33	gjabell	loool 
2018-03-26 10:33:41	jesse	xD i miss that dude. he was funny. 
2018-03-26 10:34:09	gjabell	yeah, I haven't seen him much this semester 
2018-03-26 14:31:44	jesse	2nd test took me and my partner 3 hours. about half of the questions overlapped so working with him made the amount of work higher.
2018-03-26 14:31:44		anyway, it was a pain, and I wont know my grade till tomorrow. 
2018-03-26 14:32:04	gjabell	Rip 
2018-03-26 14:32:09	gjabell	Let me know how it goes lol 
2018-03-26 14:32:17	jesse	yup 
2018-03-28 14:41:25	jesse	I'm starting to use the command line tool timetrap to log my time working on work/school/fun stuff. If you're into gathering sort of data, you should check it out. it's a gem. 
2018-03-28 14:47:18	jesse	as in the ruby package manager gem.. 
2018-03-28 14:47:35	gjabell	Huh
2018-03-28 14:47:35		Lol xD 
2018-03-28 14:56:51	jesse	have you heard good things about the cryptography class? 
2018-03-28 15:01:23	gjabell	I've heard it's the hardest comp sci class here 
2018-03-28 15:01:44	jesse	:( I heard it was fun. 
2018-03-28 15:02:58	gjabell	XD idk, might be
2018-03-28 15:02:58		I just don't want to take something I'm not sure I'll do well in 
2018-03-28 15:11:26	jesse	I'm a lil worried I won't get into the human computer interaction class (which I hear is stupid easy), so I'm looking for other csc restricted electives... I might just do my research for credit to fill that spot. 
2018-03-28 15:34:49	gjabell	Yeah that seems like a better idea lol 
2018-03-28 15:35:26	jesse	sadly, that meeting time would conflict with software security (the one class that semester that I actually want to take) 
2018-03-28 15:36:04	gjabell	Ah 
2018-03-28 15:36:08	gjabell	You could do net sec 
2018-03-28 15:37:03	jesse	and theres the problem of maybe not being able to do human computer interaction (its already full)... I'm considering cloud computing though. have you taken that? 
2018-03-28 15:37:41	gjabell	Yeah I'm in it atm 
2018-03-28 15:37:58	jesse	this semester? 
2018-03-28 15:38:16	gjabell	yep 
2018-03-28 15:38:20	jesse	how is it? 
2018-03-28 15:38:37	gjabell	honestly, really easy and pretty boring xD 
2018-03-28 15:38:55	gjabell	I was hoping it'd be more sysadmin stuff but it's more of a general overview of cloud computing 
2018-03-28 15:39:00	gjabell	and most of it is super explanatory 
2018-03-28 15:39:17	jesse	do you have projects? 
2018-03-28 15:39:22	gjabell	not that I'd be able to tell you how to actually set up a decent cloud system, but I wouldn't be able to tell you that if I were paying attention either 
2018-03-28 15:39:26	gjabell	yeah, they are also really easy lol 
2018-03-28 15:39:36	gjabell	basically just set up a VLC instance and take some screenshots 
2018-03-28 15:39:46	gjabell	if you want an easy class it's good, otherwise it's not great 
2018-03-28 15:40:04	jesse	well, i think id rather take that than compiler theory. 
2018-03-28 15:40:25	gjabell	probably yeah 
2018-03-28 15:40:40	gjabell	I like the professor, he's super smart and is genuinely excited about the subject 
2018-03-28 15:40:45	gjabell	it's just soooo boring to sit in class 
2018-03-28 15:41:41	jesse	well thats what I was expecting from Human computer interaction xD 
2018-03-28 15:41:47	gjabell	true 
2018-03-28 15:42:29	jesse	have you taken applied diff eq? 
2018-03-28 15:42:46	gjabell	nope 
2018-03-28 15:42:54	jesse	ok 
2018-03-28 15:43:36	jesse	thanks galen!! I now have a somewhat reasonable schedule. 
2018-03-28 15:43:51	gjabell	np xD 
2018-03-28 15:49:17	jesse	I guess I now have to question if I want to continue my research for pay xD... or do it for cred and drop soft security. its a lil frustrating i'll miss all the meetings if I do software security. :( 
2018-03-28 15:49:42	gjabell	hmm yeah that kinda sucks 
2018-03-28 18:14:43	jesse	who are you living with next semester? 
2018-03-28 18:16:06	gjabell	stephen (one of my roommates atm), and two randoms because my other roommate fucked up and didnt accept our apartment thing 
2018-03-28 18:17:35	jesse	one of my roommates  screwed up that way and another of them is going to a different place, so we have 2 randos as well. 
2018-03-28 18:17:41	gjabell	rip 
2018-03-28 18:17:47	gjabell	too bad we can just switch them both out lol 
2018-03-28 18:18:21	jesse	don't you mean "cant"? 
2018-03-28 18:18:40	gjabell	yes 
2018-03-28 18:19:29	jesse	we actually dont have the other people assigned. Sam is still in his spot and im pretty sure the other room is unassigned. 
2018-03-28 18:19:50	gjabell	weird 
2018-03-28 18:19:56	gjabell	they assigned our really quickly, it was odd 
2018-03-28 18:20:24	jesse	you guys may be able to do a room swappy thing to get in here, but idk if housing would let us do that though 
2018-03-28 18:20:41	gjabell	yeah 
2018-03-28 18:21:00	gjabell	we're in the top floor which we requested bc of balcony, otherwise i'd try it 
2018-03-28 18:21:43	jesse	xD but youd have to carry groceries there... bottom floor is so much better. 
2018-03-28 18:21:51	gjabell	true... 
2018-03-28 18:21:55	gjabell	although there is an elevator 
2018-03-28 18:22:23	jesse	yeah, still not worth it in my opinion. lol 
2018-03-28 18:22:37	jesse	but I understand. 
2018-03-28 18:22:53	gjabell	yeah, it was mostly my roommate's idea 
2018-03-28 18:24:48	jesse	my roommates had a similar idea before they screwed themselves over. 
2018-03-28 18:26:24	gjabell	Lol 
2018-03-28 18:29:11	jesse	is it bad that im happy one of them is moving out? 
2018-03-28 18:34:42	gjabell	Eh, I don't think so
2018-03-28 18:34:42		Living with other people is hard 
2018-03-28 18:43:48	jesse	do you have problems with your roomies? 
2018-03-28 18:46:57	gjabell	not for the most part, we've known each other for a while so we're pretty ok all around 
2018-03-28 18:47:19	gjabell	it would be nice if they were a bit less bad about putting shit away in the kitchen after they use it but whatevs 
2018-03-28 18:50:41	jesse	gotcha.  mine are loud and never clean up after themselves. and they all bring their girlfriends over every weekend and I have to clean up after them too.

2018-03-29 10:10:45	gjabell	XD 
2018-03-29 10:10:48	gjabell	Pretty much lol 
2018-03-29 11:08:54	jesse	so my research professor was like "Jesse, we will move around all of our meetings just for you". 
2018-03-29 11:09:15	jesse	cuz im the only student that isnt graduating :) 
2018-03-29 11:10:09	gjabell	Eyy, nice 
2018-03-29 21:01:05	jesse	hey galen, if I wanted to build a linux box like the one you have, what would I need? where did  you get those parts? 
2018-03-29 21:21:44	gjabell	I got them from newegg and ebay 
2018-03-29 21:25:23	jesse	gotcha. thanks. im considering building one of those. :P probably over the summer tho... or sooner if I get bored haha. 
2018-03-29 21:35:19	gjabell	XD good choice haha 
2018-03-29 21:35:30	gjabell	I can send you the part list when I get back home 
2018-03-29 21:37:29	jesse	I would appreciate that!! 
2018-04-02 16:56:31		getting channel history...
2018-03-23 20:41:41	gjabell	so I just pretended I was going to make an app for interacting with it instead 
2018-03-23 20:41:56	gjabell	and just went into a lot of detail in terms of the backend, database, frontend, etc. 
2018-03-23 20:42:39	jesse	lol but she wouldn't know if it's too much 
2018-03-23 20:43:07	gjabell	right, but the nice thing about doing comp sci stuff is that yoiu can basically make up bs and she won't know the difference 
2018-03-23 20:43:28	jesse	true. 
2018-03-24 18:01:24	jesse	have you looked into steganography? it's kinda neat. 
2018-03-24 18:03:20	jesse	i wonder if anyones found a way to hide a video inside another video. 
2018-03-24 18:25:41	gjabell	No, what is it? 
2018-03-24 18:26:28	jesse	hiding messages in pictures and stuff like that... but i think it would be cooler if you hid a picture in a picture or a video inside a video :P 
2018-03-24 18:26:35	gjabell	Huh 
2018-03-24 18:26:50	gjabell	Yeah that'd be neat xD 
2018-03-24 19:25:42	jesse	@jesse uploaded a file: https://sturgill-operators.slack.com/files/U3VPX29FW/F9V2VA0RF/togalen.jpg (toGalen)

2018-03-24 22:24:36	gjabell	Lol 
2018-03-24 23:02:01	jesse	there are messages in those pics btw. 
2018-03-26 09:08:21	jesse	did you hear anything back from the hard drive people? 
2018-03-26 09:08:52	gjabell	I sent in an RMA request, so now I just have to ship them 
2018-03-26 09:09:00	gjabell	I think I won't know what the verdict is until they RMA them tho 
2018-03-26 09:09:05	gjabell	so fingers crossed xD 
2018-03-26 09:11:17	jesse	good luck dude.  
2018-03-26 09:11:31	gjabell	thanks 
2018-03-26 09:11:44	gjabell	everything else seems to be working so far, I just haven't set up much yet 
2018-03-26 09:11:50	gjabell	still need to figure out networking and all that 
2018-03-26 09:14:03	jesse	Hopefully using the wrong end of the ethernet cord wont fry your network adapters. 
2018-03-26 09:14:42	jesse	btw, in that picture of the panda I sent ya, there was another panda. 
2018-03-26 09:14:51	gjabell	lol yeah xD 
2018-03-26 09:14:57	gjabell	hmm, I didn't see it haha 
2018-03-26 09:15:00	gjabell	let me look again 
2018-03-26 09:15:50	jesse	you wouldn't see it. its using the least significant bits of the file to store the other panda... you'd need something like 'steghide' to extract it 
2018-03-26 09:15:57	gjabell	ohh 
2018-03-26 09:16:00	gjabell	ok that would make sense lol 
2018-03-26 09:16:17	jesse	but it is funny to imagine you just staring at a picture of a panda for hours 
2018-03-26 09:16:58	gjabell	I may have spent a bit too long trying to figure out what the message was xD 
2018-03-26 09:17:55	jesse	hahaha 
2018-03-26 09:20:49	jesse	I sent some pandas to some of my other friends but I wasn't being discrete at all... but they still ended up staring at the panda for a long time. 
2018-03-26 09:22:23	jesse	Even with sending the max file-size, I still didn't notice a difference in the pandas. i was hoping it would start to look pixelated or something. 
2018-03-26 09:29:06	gjabell	lol 
2018-03-26 10:07:29	gjabell	you've taken PH205 right? 
2018-03-26 10:07:37	gjabell	PHI* 
2018-03-26 10:08:09	jesse	I'm taking it this semester 
2018-03-26 10:08:14	gjabell	ah 
2018-03-26 10:08:18	gjabell	any idea how the online is? 
2018-03-26 10:08:51	jesse	no but take it in class with Eric Carter. the lectures might as well be optional, but i go anyway 
2018-03-26 10:09:07	gjabell	hmm alright, I'll see if it fits my schedule 
2018-03-26 10:10:10	gjabell	I th ink I have a class during that time but I'm not sure yet 
2018-03-26 10:10:58	jesse	PHI 340 is also pretty easy. I'm taking that online too. just 3 tests and the final is optional. im takin it pass fail cuz its only for my free electives category. 
2018-03-26 10:11:13	jesse	it can fit humanity tho 
2018-03-26 10:12:28	jesse	I'm gonna be taking the 2nd test today 
2018-03-26 10:12:36	gjabell	ah 
2018-03-26 10:12:50	gjabell	I might take AFS 240 online, it looks prtetty easy too 
2018-03-26 10:13:43	jesse	what's that? 
2018-03-26 10:14:10	gjabell	african civilizations lol 
2018-03-26 10:14:20	gjabell	the issue is that none of the humanities look interesting to me 
2018-03-26 10:14:23	gjabell	and since I can' 
2018-03-26 10:14:31	gjabell	t double up on german ones I need a second 
2018-03-26 10:15:32	gjabell	so mostly looking for one that's super easy w/ no work, pref online lol 
2018-03-26 10:15:42	jesse	phi 340 would be easy. its kinda irritating, but the only work is the 3 tests and optional final. no video lectures btw, just readings. 
2018-03-26 10:15:55	gjabell	hmm 
2018-03-26 10:15:56	jesse	and I havent done any of the readings for this test 
2018-03-26 10:15:57	gjabell	that might not be too bad 
2018-03-26 10:16:02	gjabell	lol 
2018-03-26 10:16:06	gjabell	why is it irritating? 
2018-03-26 10:24:19	jesse	also we have "microquizzes" each monday/wednesday that is basically 1 exam question. its kinda negligible to our grade with how the grading is set up. Before the first test, I read all of the required readings and tried on all of the micro quizzes. 
2018-03-26 10:24:19		the questions are completely bananas. you may find direct quotes in the text that supports your answer and it could still be marked wrong. The class content is annoying because its about identifying pseudoscience... and the whole class is pseudoscience. there is no data presented to support their claims and there are no concrete definitions for any terms mentioned... and google doesnt help much because these terms are made up.
2018-03-26 10:24:19		but then I stopped doing the readings and taking the class seriously, and I can appreciate how easy/nonsense it is :) . I was also given a notebook from a friend who took the class. and im taking it pass fail so it doesnt matter how i do on the tests. if I do well enough on this test, I might not even have to take the 3rd one. 
2018-03-26 10:25:47	gjabell	xD 
2018-03-26 10:25:51	gjabell	sounds like kind of a pain lol 
2018-03-26 10:25:53	jesse	my recommendation could change depending on how this test goes lol. 
2018-03-26 10:25:59	gjabell	fai 
2018-03-26 10:26:01	gjabell	fair* 
2018-03-26 10:27:44	jesse	it is a pain if you take it seriously... so my advice would be to not take it seriously. just get the easy A and play video games  or something.. 
2018-03-26 10:28:06	gjabell	I could totally roll with that lol 
2018-03-26 10:28:10	jesse	and stress yourself out when the tests roll around 
2018-03-26 10:28:17	gjabell	altho it sounds like maybe it isn't that easy to get an A if nothing makes sense lol 
2018-03-26 10:29:38	jesse	fair point. lets say that its an easy B and if you want an A, consider taking the optional final to replace your lowest test grade. 
2018-03-26 10:29:54	gjabell	if it's that easy for a B I'm def interested lol 
2018-03-26 10:30:02	gjabell	I just want a humanities that I don't have to work for lol 
2018-03-26 10:31:27	jesse	but remember, you cant take it seriously. you have to take it as if youre Daniel and just get drunk before you start a reading xD 
2018-03-26 10:31:33	gjabell	loool 
2018-03-26 10:33:41	jesse	xD i miss that dude. he was funny. 
2018-03-26 10:34:09	gjabell	yeah, I haven't seen him much this semester 
2018-03-26 14:31:44	jesse	2nd test took me and my partner 3 hours. about half of the questions overlapped so working with him made the amount of work higher.
2018-03-26 14:31:44		anyway, it was a pain, and I wont know my grade till tomorrow. 
2018-03-26 14:32:04	gjabell	Rip 
2018-03-26 14:32:09	gjabell	Let me know how it goes lol 
2018-03-26 14:32:17	jesse	yup 
2018-03-28 14:41:25	jesse	I'm starting to use the command line tool timetrap to log my time working on work/school/fun stuff. If you're into gathering sort of data, you should check it out. it's a gem. 
2018-03-28 14:47:18	jesse	as in the ruby package manager gem.. 
2018-03-28 14:47:35	gjabell	Huh
2018-03-28 14:47:35		Lol xD 
2018-03-28 14:56:51	jesse	have you heard good things about the cryptography class? 
2018-03-28 15:01:23	gjabell	I've heard it's the hardest comp sci class here 
2018-03-28 15:01:44	jesse	:( I heard it was fun. 
2018-03-28 15:02:58	gjabell	XD idk, might be
2018-03-28 15:02:58		I just don't want to take something I'm not sure I'll do well in 
2018-03-28 15:11:26	jesse	I'm a lil worried I won't get into the human computer interaction class (which I hear is stupid easy), so I'm looking for other csc restricted electives... I might just do my research for credit to fill that spot. 
2018-03-28 15:34:49	gjabell	Yeah that seems like a better idea lol 
2018-03-28 15:35:26	jesse	sadly, that meeting time would conflict with software security (the one class that semester that I actually want to take) 
2018-03-28 15:36:04	gjabell	Ah 
2018-03-28 15:36:08	gjabell	You could do net sec 
2018-03-28 15:37:03	jesse	and theres the problem of maybe not being able to do human computer interaction (its already full)... I'm considering cloud computing though. have you taken that? 
2018-03-28 15:37:41	gjabell	Yeah I'm in it atm 
2018-03-28 15:37:58	jesse	this semester? 
2018-03-28 15:38:16	gjabell	yep 
2018-03-28 15:38:20	jesse	how is it? 
2018-03-28 15:38:37	gjabell	honestly, really easy and pretty boring xD 
2018-03-28 15:38:55	gjabell	I was hoping it'd be more sysadmin stuff but it's more of a general overview of cloud computing 
2018-03-28 15:39:00	gjabell	and most of it is super explanatory 
2018-03-28 15:39:17	jesse	do you have projects? 
2018-03-28 15:39:22	gjabell	not that I'd be able to tell you how to actually set up a decent cloud system, but I wouldn't be able to tell you that if I were paying attention either 
2018-03-28 15:39:26	gjabell	yeah, they are also really easy lol 
2018-03-28 15:39:36	gjabell	basically just set up a VLC instance and take some screenshots 
2018-03-28 15:39:46	gjabell	if you want an easy class it's good, otherwise it's not great 
2018-03-28 15:40:04	jesse	well, i think id rather take that than compiler theory. 
2018-03-28 15:40:25	gjabell	probably yeah 
2018-03-28 15:40:40	gjabell	I like the professor, he's super smart and is genuinely excited about the subject 
2018-03-28 15:40:45	gjabell	it's just soooo boring to sit in class 
2018-03-28 15:41:41	jesse	well thats what I was expecting from Human computer interaction xD 
2018-03-28 15:41:47	gjabell	true 
2018-03-28 15:42:29	jesse	have you taken applied diff eq? 
2018-03-28 15:42:46	gjabell	nope 
2018-03-28 15:42:54	jesse	ok 
2018-03-28 15:43:36	jesse	thanks galen!! I now have a somewhat reasonable schedule. 
2018-03-28 15:43:51	gjabell	np xD 
2018-03-28 15:49:17	jesse	I guess I now have to question if I want to continue my research for pay xD... or do it for cred and drop soft security. its a lil frustrating i'll miss all the meetings if I do software security. :( 
2018-03-28 15:49:42	gjabell	hmm yeah that kinda sucks 
2018-03-28 18:14:43	jesse	who are you living with next semester? 
2018-03-28 18:16:06	gjabell	stephen (one of my roommates atm), and two randoms because my other roommate fucked up and didnt accept our apartment thing 
2018-03-28 18:17:35	jesse	one of my roommates  screwed up that way and another of them is going to a different place, so we have 2 randos as well. 
2018-03-28 18:17:41	gjabell	rip 
2018-03-28 18:17:47	gjabell	too bad we can just switch them both out lol 
2018-03-28 18:18:21	jesse	don't you mean "cant"? 
2018-03-28 18:18:40	gjabell	yes 
2018-03-28 18:19:29	jesse	we actually dont have the other people assigned. Sam is still in his spot and im pretty sure the other room is unassigned. 
2018-03-28 18:19:50	gjabell	weird 
2018-03-28 18:19:56	gjabell	they assigned our really quickly, it was odd 
2018-03-28 18:20:24	jesse	you guys may be able to do a room swappy thing to get in here, but idk if housing would let us do that though 
2018-03-28 18:20:41	gjabell	yeah 
2018-03-28 18:21:00	gjabell	we're in the top floor which we requested bc of balcony, otherwise i'd try it 
2018-03-28 18:21:43	jesse	xD but youd have to carry groceries there... bottom floor is so much better. 
2018-03-28 18:21:51	gjabell	true... 
2018-03-28 18:21:55	gjabell	although there is an elevator 
2018-03-28 18:22:23	jesse	yeah, still not worth it in my opinion. lol 
2018-03-28 18:22:37	jesse	but I understand. 
2018-03-28 18:22:53	gjabell	yeah, it was mostly my roommate's idea 
2018-03-28 18:24:48	jesse	my roommates had a similar idea before they screwed themselves over. 
2018-03-28 18:26:24	gjabell	Lol 
2018-03-28 18:29:11	jesse	is it bad that im happy one of them is moving out? 
2018-03-28 18:34:42	gjabell	Eh, I don't think so
2018-03-28 18:34:42		Living with other people is hard 
2018-03-28 18:43:48	jesse	do you have problems with your roomies? 
2018-03-28 18:46:57	gjabell	not for the most part, we've known each other for a while so we're pretty ok all around 
2018-03-28 18:47:19	gjabell	it would be nice if they were a bit less bad about putting shit away in the kitchen after they use it but whatevs 
2018-03-28 18:50:41	jesse	gotcha.  mine are loud and never clean up after themselves. and they all bring their girlfriends over every weekend and I have to clean up after them too. 
2018-03-28 18:50:55	gjabell	eww 
2018-03-29 09:04:54	jesse	@jesse uploaded a file: https://sturgill-operators.slack.com/files/U3VPX29FW/F9XK6B2C9/1973.png (you)

2018-03-29 10:10:48	gjabell	Pretty much lol 
2018-03-29 11:08:54	jesse	so my research professor was like "Jesse, we will move around all of our meetings just for you". 
2018-03-29 11:09:15	jesse	cuz im the only student that isnt graduating :) 
2018-03-29 11:10:09	gjabell	Eyy, nice 
2018-03-29 21:01:05	jesse	hey galen, if I wanted to build a linux box like the one you have, what would I need? where did  you get those parts? 
2018-03-29 21:21:44	gjabell	I got them from newegg and ebay 
2018-03-29 21:25:23	jesse	gotcha. thanks. im considering building one of those. :P probably over the summer tho... or sooner if I get bored haha. 
2018-03-29 21:35:19	gjabell	XD good choice haha 
2018-03-29 21:35:30	gjabell	I can send you the part list when I get back home 
2018-03-29 21:37:29	jesse	I would appreciate that!!

2018-03-29 22:08:54	gjabell	I already had the drive, so I didn't actually buy that specific one 
2018-03-29 22:09:10	gjabell	and I got the ram super cheap on ebay so I'm not sure if that's the exact model (or price) 
2018-03-29 22:09:56	gjabell	the case comes with a mobo built in, and it takes any LGA1151 cpu, but I didn't want to spend a bunch of money on it (plus it probably wouldn't run very cool), so I just went with a lower end pentium 
2018-03-30 08:57:55	jesse	huh. Thank you! how does it run in comparison to your laptop? 
2018-03-30 09:03:47	gjabell	Benchmarks say its maybe twice as good? But it's kinda hard to tell in the wild haha 
2018-03-30 09:03:59	gjabell	I don't have any issues tho 
2018-03-30 09:04:11	gjabell	Plus its driving 2 1440p screens like a champ 
2018-03-30 09:32:19	jesse	sounds good. I dont really do much gaming so its not really much of an issue if it isnt good enough for that. I just want something that I can add more RAM into :P 
2018-03-30 12:51:51	gjabell	I haven't tried gaming on it, don't imagine it'd be great, but maybe better than a laptop 
2018-03-30 12:54:14	gjabell	Since you don't already have a desktop it might be worth looking into a mini itx build or similar 
2018-03-30 12:54:19	jesse	xD I pretty much just play visual novels... and my laptop did fine. I was pretty into hollow knight though... but even thats just a 2d game that plays decently on my laptop. 
2018-03-30 12:54:52	gjabell	You won't be able to find something quite as small as the deskmini but it'll be more upgradable 
2018-03-30 12:55:02	gjabell	Plus if something breaks it's easier to replace 
2018-03-30 12:55:50	jesse	why wouldnt i be able to find it? didnt you just link to a store page? 
2018-03-30 12:58:16	jesse	i really just want something to program on and occasionally view videos without feeling like im abusing my laptop all the time... 
2018-03-30 12:59:35	gjabell	Ah
2018-03-30 12:59:35		I meant there aren't very many options for smaller cases 
2018-03-30 12:59:47	gjabell	That one is small BC it has a proprietary mobo 
2018-03-30 13:00:39	jesse	oh I gotcha. yeah I really liked that about your case. It was small but not too small to where I couldnt add more ram or disk space. 
2018-03-30 13:05:39	gjabell	Yeah
2018-03-30 13:05:39		Not sure if it actually has expansion space for more ram, so you'd need to buy whole new ram ubf 
2018-03-30 13:05:59	gjabell	With a mini itx you could get 2 sticks and upgrade to 4 later on 
2018-03-30 13:07:01	jesse	...but I could put in a bigger ram stick into that slot.... ive never had these luxuries with my laptop galen lol 
2018-03-30 13:07:53	gjabell	True, ram is super expensive ATM tho so it would be a lot of money to buy ram and then replace it xD just saying 
2018-03-30 13:08:12	gjabell	You can get some pretty small mini itx builds I think, at least height wise 
2018-03-30 13:08:45	gjabell	On the other hand the little case uses laptop ram so maybe you could find 32gb for cheap or somethinf 
2018-03-30 13:08:51	gjabell	Probably would last you a while 
2018-03-30 13:12:14	jesse	16 gigs of ram for my laptop would be around 150 dollars... 
2018-03-30 13:12:43	jesse	i think i misread your message though 
2018-03-30 13:14:48	jesse	16 gigs of ram would be more than enough for me i think 
2018-03-30 13:15:13	jesse	I thought you were suggesting just upgrading my laptop instead. 
2018-03-30 13:18:34	jesse	is laptop ram different from desktop ram? 
2018-03-30 13:20:11	gjabell	Yes, it's not as wide
2018-03-30 13:20:11		240 vs 288 pin I think? 
2018-03-30 13:20:44	gjabell	I was able to find 16 gigs on eBay for 100$ so you might get lucky and get it for cheap 
2018-03-30 13:21:03	gjabell	If you needed more it would start getting real expensive tho 
2018-03-30 13:21:13	gjabell	Since laptops don't typically have that much ram 
2018-03-30 13:32:59	jesse	I see what ya mean. 
2018-04-02 18:24:27	jesse	the whole tabs vs buffers thing seems pretty dumb to me. The 'vim experts' online are saying things like 'thats not how vim was designed' and when they talk about using buffers instead, theyre all like 'ok so you're going to need 8 plugins for this to work well'. 
2018-04-02 18:26:42	jesse	buffers seem pretty cool. tabs seem pretty cool. if you have the same file open in multiple tabs, thats kinda dumb. 
2018-04-02 18:27:56	gjabell	that's fair 
2018-04-02 18:28:12	gjabell	honestly whatever works for your workflow is more important anyways 
2018-04-02 18:28:29	gjabell	it might be that one has better performance or one has better support for plugins but until that is an issue it's w/e 
2018-04-02 18:29:09	jesse	xD yeah.  
2018-04-02 18:29:24	jesse	knowing buffers is still helpful though 
2018-04-02 18:33:54	gjabell	yeah 
2018-04-02 18:41:10	jesse	just checked it. opening the same files in different tabs just opens up the same buffer lol. 
2018-04-02 18:41:21	gjabell	lol xD 
2018-04-02 18:41:52	jesse	what a waste of my time haha  
2018-04-02 18:42:07	jesse	vsplit and split are gold though 
2018-04-02 18:42:21	jesse	and being able to navigate open buffers is pretty sweet 
2018-04-02 18:42:40	jesse	but the last 30 minutes has just been me questioning why people get emotionally charged over this haha 
2018-04-02 18:43:07	jesse	and thinking that there is some sort of reasoning beyond this. 
2018-04-02 18:43:55	gjabell	lol rip 
2018-04-02 18:44:08	gjabell	if you start using plugins at some point check out ctrl+P 
2018-04-02 18:44:12	gjabell	it's pretty sweet 
2018-04-02 18:46:26	jesse	that does seem pretty cool. But I do like to preserve my ability to program on servers that I do not have install permissions to. 
2018-04-02 18:47:00	gjabell	fair enough I guess, although if you have write access to your home directory (which hopefully you do), that's where all the plugins go 
2018-04-02 18:49:28	jesse	how are you installing you're plugins? 
2018-04-02 18:50:22	gjabell	I have a plugin manager called vim-plug 
2018-04-02 18:50:48	jesse	how did you install vim-plug? 
2018-04-02 18:50:54	jesse	:P 
2018-04-02 18:51:15	gjabell	and then my vimrc has some syntax for vim plug that tells it which plugins it should install and load 
2018-04-02 18:51:19	gjabell	and vim plug does the rest 
2018-04-02 18:51:20	gjabell	lemme check 
2018-04-02 18:51:52	jesse	although I'm sure I could find a way to install a vim plugin manager in the home directory if I really wanted to. 
2018-04-02 18:51:59	gjabell	curl -fLo ~/.vim/autoload/plug.vim --create-dirs \ 
2018-04-02 18:51:59	gjabell	https://raw.githubusercontent.com/junegunn/vim-plug/master/plug.vim 
2018-04-02 18:52:16	gjabell	that's for normal vim, tehre's another one for nvim 
2018-04-02 18:52:21	gjabell	not sure which you use 
2018-04-02 18:52:35	jesse	normal vim 
2018-04-02 18:52:36	gjabell	then in your vimrc you put: call plug#begin('~/.vim/plugged') 
2018-04-02 18:52:44	gjabell	then lines like Plug 'junegunn/vim-easy-align' 
2018-04-02 18:52:51	gjabell	then call plug#end() 
2018-04-02 18:53:14	gjabell	and when you do :PlugInstall it'll go grab all of the plguins in between the begin and end and install them for you 
2018-04-02 18:53:16	gjabell	it's super nice 
2018-04-02 18:53:20	gjabell	you can also do :PlugUpdate 
2018-04-02 18:53:25	gjabell	to update ones 
2018-04-02 18:53:44	jesse	well dang... now I have no reason to not use plugins... 
2018-04-02 18:53:51	gjabell	ikr 
2018-04-02 18:55:12	gjabell	https://pastebin.com/fGgZa15T 
2018-04-02 18:55:17	gjabell	that's mine if you wanna take a look 
2018-04-02 18:55:23	gjabell	probably some extra stuff in it tho 
2018-04-02 18:55:40	gjabell	plus the plug#begin() will be a bit different bc I'm using nvim 
2018-04-02 18:56:44	jesse	lol thanks.  
2018-04-02 18:57:57	gjabell	most of it is copied btw, I'm really not that good at vim xD 
2018-04-02 19:00:48	jesse	everyone copies vim configs lol 
2018-04-02 19:01:06	gjabell	I guess they all stem from some masterconfig somewhere xD 
2018-04-02 19:01:12	jesse	also, chai green tea is really good. 
2018-04-02 19:01:17	gjabell	it sounds good 
2018-04-03 16:38:26		getting channel history...
2018-03-26 10:15:42	jesse	phi 340 would be easy. its kinda irritating, but the only work is the 3 tests and optional final. no video lectures btw, just readings. 
2018-03-26 10:15:55	gjabell	hmm 
2018-03-26 10:15:56	jesse	and I havent done any of the readings for this test 
2018-03-26 10:15:57	gjabell	that might not be too bad 
2018-03-26 10:16:02	gjabell	lol 
2018-03-26 10:16:06	gjabell	why is it irritating? 
2018-03-26 10:24:19	jesse	also we have "microquizzes" each monday/wednesday that is basically 1 exam question. its kinda negligible to our grade with how the grading is set up. Before the first test, I read all of the required readings and tried on all of the micro quizzes. 
2018-03-26 10:24:19		the questions are completely bananas. you may find direct quotes in the text that supports your answer and it could still be marked wrong. The class content is annoying because its about identifying pseudoscience... and the whole class is pseudoscience. there is no data presented to support their claims and there are no concrete definitions for any terms mentioned... and google doesnt help much because these terms are made up.
2018-03-26 10:24:19		but then I stopped doing the readings and taking the class seriously, and I can appreciate how easy/nonsense it is :) . I was also given a notebook from a friend who took the class. and im taking it pass fail so it doesnt matter how i do on the tests. if I do well enough on this test, I might not even have to take the 3rd one. 
2018-03-26 10:25:47	gjabell	xD 
2018-03-26 10:25:51	gjabell	sounds like kind of a pain lol 
2018-03-26 10:25:53	jesse	my recommendation could change depending on how this test goes lol. 
2018-03-26 10:25:59	gjabell	fai 
2018-03-26 10:26:01	gjabell	fair* 
2018-03-26 10:27:44	jesse	it is a pain if you take it seriously... so my advice would be to not take it seriously. just get the easy A and play video games  or something.. 
2018-03-26 10:28:06	gjabell	I could totally roll with that lol 
2018-03-26 10:28:10	jesse	and stress yourself out when the tests roll around 
2018-03-26 10:28:17	gjabell	altho it sounds like maybe it isn't that easy to get an A if nothing makes sense lol 
2018-03-26 10:29:38	jesse	fair point. lets say that its an easy B and if you want an A, consider taking the optional final to replace your lowest test grade. 
2018-03-26 10:29:54	gjabell	if it's that easy for a B I'm def interested lol 
2018-03-26 10:30:02	gjabell	I just want a humanities that I don't have to work for lol 
2018-03-26 10:31:27	jesse	but remember, you cant take it seriously. you have to take it as if youre Daniel and just get drunk before you start a reading xD 
2018-03-26 10:31:33	gjabell	loool 
2018-03-26 10:33:41	jesse	xD i miss that dude. he was funny. 
2018-03-26 10:34:09	gjabell	yeah, I haven't seen him much this semester 
2018-03-26 14:31:44	jesse	2nd test took me and my partner 3 hours. about half of the questions overlapped so working with him made the amount of work higher.
2018-03-26 14:31:44		anyway, it was a pain, and I wont know my grade till tomorrow. 
2018-03-26 14:32:04	gjabell	Rip 
2018-03-26 14:32:09	gjabell	Let me know how it goes lol 
2018-03-26 14:32:17	jesse	yup 
2018-03-28 14:41:25	jesse	I'm starting to use the command line tool timetrap to log my time working on work/school/fun stuff. If you're into gathering sort of data, you should check it out. it's a gem. 
2018-03-28 14:47:18	jesse	as in the ruby package manager gem.. 
2018-03-28 14:47:35	gjabell	Huh
2018-03-28 14:47:35		Lol xD 
2018-03-28 14:56:51	jesse	have you heard good things about the cryptography class? 
2018-03-28 15:01:23	gjabell	I've heard it's the hardest comp sci class here 
2018-03-28 15:01:44	jesse	:( I heard it was fun. 
2018-03-28 15:02:58	gjabell	XD idk, might be
2018-03-28 15:02:58		I just don't want to take something I'm not sure I'll do well in 
2018-03-28 15:11:26	jesse	I'm a lil worried I won't get into the human computer interaction class (which I hear is stupid easy), so I'm looking for other csc restricted electives... I might just do my research for credit to fill that spot. 
2018-03-28 15:34:49	gjabell	Yeah that seems like a better idea lol 
2018-03-28 15:35:26	jesse	sadly, that meeting time would conflict with software security (the one class that semester that I actually want to take) 
2018-03-28 15:36:04	gjabell	Ah 
2018-03-28 15:36:08	gjabell	You could do net sec 
2018-03-28 15:37:03	jesse	and theres the problem of maybe not being able to do human computer interaction (its already full)... I'm considering cloud computing though. have you taken that? 
2018-03-28 15:37:41	gjabell	Yeah I'm in it atm 
2018-03-28 15:37:58	jesse	this semester? 
2018-03-28 15:38:16	gjabell	yep 
2018-03-28 15:38:20	jesse	how is it? 
2018-03-28 15:38:37	gjabell	honestly, really easy and pretty boring xD 
2018-03-28 15:38:55	gjabell	I was hoping it'd be more sysadmin stuff but it's more of a general overview of cloud computing 
2018-03-28 15:39:00	gjabell	and most of it is super explanatory 
2018-03-28 15:39:17	jesse	do you have projects? 
2018-03-28 15:39:22	gjabell	not that I'd be able to tell you how to actually set up a decent cloud system, but I wouldn't be able to tell you that if I were paying attention either 
2018-03-28 15:39:26	gjabell	yeah, they are also really easy lol 
2018-03-28 15:39:36	gjabell	basically just set up a VLC instance and take some screenshots 
2018-03-28 15:39:46	gjabell	if you want an easy class it's good, otherwise it's not great 
2018-03-28 15:40:04	jesse	well, i think id rather take that than compiler theory. 
2018-03-28 15:40:25	gjabell	probably yeah 
2018-03-28 15:40:40	gjabell	I like the professor, he's super smart and is genuinely excited about the subject 
2018-03-28 15:40:45	gjabell	it's just soooo boring to sit in class 
2018-03-28 15:41:41	jesse	well thats what I was expecting from Human computer interaction xD 
2018-03-28 15:41:47	gjabell	true 
2018-03-28 15:42:29	jesse	have you taken applied diff eq? 
2018-03-28 15:42:46	gjabell	nope 
2018-03-28 15:42:54	jesse	ok 
2018-03-28 15:43:36	jesse	thanks galen!! I now have a somewhat reasonable schedule. 
2018-03-28 15:43:51	gjabell	np xD 
2018-03-28 15:49:17	jesse	I guess I now have to question if I want to continue my research for pay xD... or do it for cred and drop soft security. its a lil frustrating i'll miss all the meetings if I do software security. :( 
2018-03-28 15:49:42	gjabell	hmm yeah that kinda sucks 
2018-03-28 18:14:43	jesse	who are you living with next semester? 
2018-03-28 18:16:06	gjabell	stephen (one of my roommates atm), and two randoms because my other roommate fucked up and didnt accept our apartment thing 
2018-03-28 18:17:35	jesse	one of my roommates  screwed up that way and another of them is going to a different place, so we have 2 randos as well. 
2018-03-28 18:17:41	gjabell	rip 
2018-03-28 18:17:47	gjabell	too bad we can just switch them both out lol 
2018-03-28 18:18:21	jesse	don't you mean "cant"? 
2018-03-28 18:18:40	gjabell	yes 
2018-03-28 18:19:29	jesse	we actually dont have the other people assigned. Sam is still in his spot and im pretty sure the other room is unassigned. 
2018-03-28 18:19:50	gjabell	weird 
2018-03-28 18:19:56	gjabell	they assigned our really quickly, it was odd 
2018-03-28 18:20:24	jesse	you guys may be able to do a room swappy thing to get in here, but idk if housing would let us do that though 
2018-03-28 18:20:41	gjabell	yeah 
2018-03-28 18:21:00	gjabell	we're in the top floor which we requested bc of balcony, otherwise i'd try it 
2018-03-28 18:21:43	jesse	xD but youd have to carry groceries there... bottom floor is so much better. 
2018-03-28 18:21:51	gjabell	true... 
2018-03-28 18:21:55	gjabell	although there is an elevator 
2018-03-28 18:22:23	jesse	yeah, still not worth it in my opinion. lol 
2018-03-28 18:22:37	jesse	but I understand. 
2018-03-28 18:22:53	gjabell	yeah, it was mostly my roommate's idea 
2018-03-28 18:24:48	jesse	my roommates had a similar idea before they screwed themselves over. 
2018-03-28 18:26:24	gjabell	Lol 
2018-03-28 18:29:11	jesse	is it bad that im happy one of them is moving out? 
2018-03-28 18:34:42	gjabell	Eh, I don't think so
2018-03-28 18:34:42		Living with other people is hard 
2018-03-28 18:43:48	jesse	do you have problems with your roomies? 
2018-03-28 18:46:57	gjabell	not for the most part, we've known each other for a while so we're pretty ok all around 
2018-03-28 18:47:19	gjabell	it would be nice if they were a bit less bad about putting shit away in the kitchen after they use it but whatevs 
2018-03-28 18:50:41	jesse	gotcha.  mine are loud and never clean up after themselves. and they all bring their girlfriends over every weekend and I have to clean up after them too. 
2018-03-28 18:50:55	gjabell	eww 
2018-03-29 09:04:54	jesse	@jesse uploaded a file: https://sturgill-operators.slack.com/files/U3VPX29FW/F9XK6B2C9/1973.png (you) 
2018-03-29 10:10:45	gjabell	XD 
2018-03-29 10:10:48	gjabell	Pretty much lol 
2018-03-29 11:08:54	jesse	so my research professor was like "Jesse, we will move around all of our meetings just for you". 
2018-03-29 11:09:15	jesse	cuz im the only student that isnt graduating :) 
2018-03-29 11:10:09	gjabell	Eyy, nice 
2018-03-29 21:01:05	jesse	hey galen, if I wanted to build a linux box like the one you have, what would I need? where did  you get those parts? 
2018-03-29 21:21:44	gjabell	I got them from newegg and ebay 
2018-03-29 21:25:23	jesse	gotcha. thanks. im considering building one of those. :P probably over the summer tho... or sooner if I get bored haha. 
2018-03-29 21:35:19	gjabell	XD good choice haha 
2018-03-29 21:35:30	gjabell	I can send you the part list when I get back home 
2018-03-29 21:37:29	jesse	I would appreciate that!! 
2018-03-29 22:08:24	gjabell	case: https://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16856158048&cm_re=asrock_deskmini-_-56-158-048-_-Product 
2018-03-29 22:08:30	gjabell	cpu: https://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16819117743&cm_re=g4560-_-19-117-743-_-Product 
2018-03-29 22:08:36	gjabell	ram: https://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=9SIA4UB4WB5409&cm_re=crucial_ddr4_2133_sodimm_8gb-_-9SIA4UB4WB5409-_-Product 
2018-03-29 22:08:40	gjabell	drive: https://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=9SIAAPK7855382&cm_re=256gb_nvme-_-0D9-0009-001S9-_-Product 
2018-03-29 22:08:54	gjabell	I already had the drive, so I didn't actually buy that specific one 
2018-03-29 22:09:10	gjabell	and I got the ram super cheap on ebay so I'm not sure if that's the exact model (or price) 
2018-03-29 22:09:56	gjabell	the case comes with a mobo built in, and it takes any LGA1151 cpu, but I didn't want to spend a bunch of money on it (plus it probably wouldn't run very cool), so I just went with a lower end pentium 
2018-03-30 08:57:55	jesse	huh. Thank you! how does it run in comparison to your laptop? 
2018-03-30 09:03:47	gjabell	Benchmarks say its maybe twice as good? But it's kinda hard to tell in the wild haha 
2018-03-30 09:03:59	gjabell	I don't have any issues tho 
2018-03-30 09:04:11	gjabell	Plus its driving 2 1440p screens like a champ 
2018-03-30 09:32:19	jesse	sounds good. I dont really do much gaming so its not really much of an issue if it isnt good enough for that. I just want something that I can add more RAM into :P 
2018-03-30 12:51:51	gjabell	I haven't tried gaming on it, don't imagine it'd be great, but maybe better than a laptop 
2018-03-30 12:54:14	gjabell	Since you don't already have a desktop it might be worth looking into a mini itx build or similar 
2018-03-30 12:54:19	jesse	xD I pretty much just play visual novels... and my laptop did fine. I was pretty into hollow knight though... but even thats just a 2d game that plays decently on my laptop. 
2018-03-30 12:54:52	gjabell	You won't be able to find something quite as small as the deskmini but it'll be more upgradable 
2018-03-30 12:55:02	gjabell	Plus if something breaks it's easier to replace 
2018-03-30 12:55:50	jesse	why wouldnt i be able to find it? didnt you just link to a store page? 
2018-03-30 12:58:16	jesse	i really just want something to program on and occasionally view videos without feeling like im abusing my laptop all the time... 
2018-03-30 12:59:35	gjabell	Ah
2018-03-30 12:59:35		I meant there aren't very many options for smaller cases 
2018-03-30 12:59:47	gjabell	That one is small BC it has a proprietary mobo 
2018-03-30 13:00:39	jesse	oh I gotcha. yeah I really liked that about your case. It was small but not too small to where I couldnt add more ram or disk space. 
2018-03-30 13:05:39	gjabell	Yeah
2018-03-30 13:05:39		Not sure if it actually has expansion space for more ram, so you'd need to buy whole new ram ubf 
2018-03-30 13:05:59	gjabell	With a mini itx you could get 2 sticks and upgrade to 4 later on 
2018-03-30 13:07:01	jesse	...but I could put in a bigger ram stick into that slot.... ive never had these luxuries with my laptop galen lol 
2018-03-30 13:07:53	gjabell	True, ram is super expensive ATM tho so it would be a lot of money to buy ram and then replace it xD just saying 
2018-03-30 13:08:12	gjabell	You can get some pretty small mini itx builds I think, at least height wise 
2018-03-30 13:08:45	gjabell	On the other hand the little case uses laptop ram so maybe you could find 32gb for cheap or somethinf 
2018-03-30 13:08:51	gjabell	Probably would last you a while 
2018-03-30 13:12:14	jesse	16 gigs of ram for my laptop would be around 150 dollars... 
2018-03-30 13:12:43	jesse	i think i misread your message though 
2018-03-30 13:14:48	jesse	16 gigs of ram would be more than enough for me i think 
2018-03-30 13:15:13	jesse	I thought you were suggesting just upgrading my laptop instead. 
2018-03-30 13:18:34	jesse	is laptop ram different from desktop ram? 
2018-03-30 13:20:11	gjabell	Yes, it's not as wide
2018-03-30 13:20:11		240 vs 288 pin I think? 
2018-03-30 13:20:44	gjabell	I was able to find 16 gigs on eBay for 100$ so you might get lucky and get it for cheap 
2018-03-30 13:21:03	gjabell	If you needed more it would start getting real expensive tho 
2018-03-30 13:21:13	gjabell	Since laptops don't typically have that much ram 
2018-03-30 13:32:59	jesse	I see what ya mean. 
2018-04-02 18:24:27	jesse	the whole tabs vs buffers thing seems pretty dumb to me. The 'vim experts' online are saying things like 'thats not how vim was designed' and when they talk about using buffers instead, theyre all like 'ok so you're going to need 8 plugins for this to work well'. 
2018-04-02 18:26:42	jesse	buffers seem pretty cool. tabs seem pretty cool. if you have the same file open in multiple tabs, thats kinda dumb. 
2018-04-02 18:27:56	gjabell	that's fair 
2018-04-02 18:28:12	gjabell	honestly whatever works for your workflow is more important anyways 
2018-04-02 18:28:29	gjabell	it might be that one has better performance or one has better support for plugins but until that is an issue it's w/e 
2018-04-02 18:29:09	jesse	xD yeah.  
2018-04-02 18:29:24	jesse	knowing buffers is still helpful though 
2018-04-02 18:33:54	gjabell	yeah 
2018-04-02 18:41:10	jesse	just checked it. opening the same files in different tabs just opens up the same buffer lol. 
2018-04-02 18:41:21	gjabell	lol xD 
2018-04-02 18:41:52	jesse	what a waste of my time haha  
2018-04-02 18:42:07	jesse	vsplit and split are gold though 
2018-04-02 18:42:21	jesse	and being able to navigate open buffers is pretty sweet 
2018-04-02 18:42:40	jesse	but the last 30 minutes has just been me questioning why people get emotionally charged over this haha 
2018-04-02 18:43:07	jesse	and thinking that there is some sort of reasoning beyond this. 
2018-04-02 18:43:55	gjabell	lol rip 
2018-04-02 18:44:08	gjabell	if you start using plugins at some point check out ctrl+P 
2018-04-02 18:44:12	gjabell	it's pretty sweet 
2018-04-02 18:46:26	jesse	that does seem pretty cool. But I do like to preserve my ability to program on servers that I do not have install permissions to. 
2018-04-02 18:47:00	gjabell	fair enough I guess, although if you have write access to your home directory (which hopefully you do), that's where all the plugins go 
2018-04-02 18:49:28	jesse	how are you installing you're plugins? 
2018-04-02 18:50:22	gjabell	I have a plugin manager called vim-plug 
2018-04-02 18:50:48	jesse	how did you install vim-plug? 
2018-04-02 18:50:54	jesse	:P 
2018-04-02 18:51:15	gjabell	and then my vimrc has some syntax for vim plug that tells it which plugins it should install and load 
2018-04-02 18:51:19	gjabell	and vim plug does the rest 
2018-04-02 18:51:20	gjabell	lemme check 
2018-04-02 18:51:52	jesse	although I'm sure I could find a way to install a vim plugin manager in the home directory if I really wanted to. 
2018-04-02 18:51:59	gjabell	curl -fLo ~/.vim/autoload/plug.vim --create-dirs \ 
2018-04-02 18:51:59	gjabell	https://raw.githubusercontent.com/junegunn/vim-plug/master/plug.vim 
2018-04-02 18:52:16	gjabell	that's for normal vim, tehre's another one for nvim 
2018-04-02 18:52:21	gjabell	not sure which you use 
2018-04-02 18:52:35	jesse	normal vim 
2018-04-02 18:52:36	gjabell	then in your vimrc you put: call plug#begin('~/.vim/plugged') 
2018-04-02 18:52:44	gjabell	then lines like Plug 'junegunn/vim-easy-align' 
2018-04-02 18:52:51	gjabell	then call plug#end() 
2018-04-02 18:53:14	gjabell	and when you do :PlugInstall it'll go grab all of the plguins in between the begin and end and install them for you 
2018-04-02 18:53:16	gjabell	it's super nice 
2018-04-02 18:53:20	gjabell	you can also do :PlugUpdate 
2018-04-02 18:53:25	gjabell	to update ones 
2018-04-02 18:53:44	jesse	well dang... now I have no reason to not use plugins... 
2018-04-02 18:53:51	gjabell	ikr 
2018-04-02 18:55:12	gjabell	https://pastebin.com/fGgZa15T
2018-04-02 18:55:12		[VIM] vimrc - Pastebin.com 
2018-04-02 18:55:17	gjabell	that's mine if you wanna take a look 
2018-04-02 18:55:23	gjabell	probably some extra stuff in it tho 
2018-04-02 18:55:40	gjabell	plus the plug#begin() will be a bit different bc I'm using nvim 
2018-04-02 18:56:44	jesse	lol thanks.  
2018-04-02 18:57:57	gjabell	most of it is copied btw, I'm really not that good at vim xD 
2018-04-02 19:00:48	jesse	everyone copies vim configs lol 
2018-04-02 19:01:06	gjabell	I guess they all stem from some masterconfig somewhere xD 
2018-04-02 19:01:12	jesse	also, chai green tea is really good. 
2018-04-02 19:01:17	gjabell	it sounds good 
2018-04-03 15:13:45	gjabell	when do you want to study for the exam? 
2018-04-03 15:14:18	jesse	omg youre soo neeedyyy 
2018-04-03 15:14:25	gjabell	lol xD 
2018-04-03 15:14:25	jesse	xD jk 
2018-04-03 16:41:37	jesse	meant to get back to this but I was working on a group project. Some time friday or this weekend maybe? or next tuesday anytime other than plm time? 
2018-04-03 16:42:00	gjabell	all good 
2018-04-03 16:42:13	gjabell	yeah that'd work, I should be pretty free other than the PLM project 
2018-04-04 17:58:05		getting channel history...
2018-03-26 10:15:57	gjabell	that might not be too bad 
2018-03-26 10:16:02	gjabell	lol 
2018-03-26 10:16:06	gjabell	why is it irritating? 
2018-03-26 10:24:19	jesse	also we have "microquizzes" each monday/wednesday that is basically 1 exam question. its kinda negligible to our grade with how the grading is set up. Before the first test, I read all of the required readings and tried on all of the micro quizzes. 
2018-03-26 10:24:19		the questions are completely bananas. you may find direct quotes in the text that supports your answer and it could still be marked wrong. The class content is annoying because its about identifying pseudoscience... and the whole class is pseudoscience. there is no data presented to support their claims and there are no concrete definitions for any terms mentioned... and google doesnt help much because these terms are made up.
2018-03-26 10:24:19		but then I stopped doing the readings and taking the class seriously, and I can appreciate how easy/nonsense it is :) . I was also given a notebook from a friend who took the class. and im taking it pass fail so it doesnt matter how i do on the tests. if I do well enough on this test, I might not even have to take the 3rd one. 
2018-03-26 10:25:47	gjabell	xD 
2018-03-26 10:25:51	gjabell	sounds like kind of a pain lol 
2018-03-26 10:25:53	jesse	my recommendation could change depending on how this test goes lol. 
2018-03-26 10:25:59	gjabell	fai 
2018-03-26 10:26:01	gjabell	fair* 
2018-03-26 10:27:44	jesse	it is a pain if you take it seriously... so my advice would be to not take it seriously. just get the easy A and play video games  or something.. 
2018-03-26 10:28:06	gjabell	I could totally roll with that lol 
2018-03-26 10:28:10	jesse	and stress yourself out when the tests roll around 
2018-03-26 10:28:17	gjabell	altho it sounds like maybe it isn't that easy to get an A if nothing makes sense lol 
2018-03-26 10:29:38	jesse	fair point. lets say that its an easy B and if you want an A, consider taking the optional final to replace your lowest test grade. 
2018-03-26 10:29:54	gjabell	if it's that easy for a B I'm def interested lol 
2018-03-26 10:30:02	gjabell	I just want a humanities that I don't have to work for lol 
2018-03-26 10:31:27	jesse	but remember, you cant take it seriously. you have to take it as if youre Daniel and just get drunk before you start a reading xD 
2018-03-26 10:31:33	gjabell	loool 
2018-03-26 10:33:41	jesse	xD i miss that dude. he was funny. 
2018-03-26 10:34:09	gjabell	yeah, I haven't seen him much this semester 
2018-03-26 14:31:44	jesse	2nd test took me and my partner 3 hours. about half of the questions overlapped so working with him made the amount of work higher.
2018-03-26 14:31:44		anyway, it was a pain, and I wont know my grade till tomorrow. 
2018-03-26 14:32:04	gjabell	Rip 
2018-03-26 14:32:09	gjabell	Let me know how it goes lol 
2018-03-26 14:32:17	jesse	yup 
2018-03-28 14:41:25	jesse	I'm starting to use the command line tool timetrap to log my time working on work/school/fun stuff. If you're into gathering sort of data, you should check it out. it's a gem. 
2018-03-28 14:47:18	jesse	as in the ruby package manager gem.. 
2018-03-28 14:47:35	gjabell	Huh
2018-03-28 14:47:35		Lol xD 
2018-03-28 14:56:51	jesse	have you heard good things about the cryptography class? 
2018-03-28 15:01:23	gjabell	I've heard it's the hardest comp sci class here 
2018-03-28 15:01:44	jesse	:( I heard it was fun. 
2018-03-28 15:02:58	gjabell	XD idk, might be
2018-03-28 15:02:58		I just don't want to take something I'm not sure I'll do well in 
2018-03-28 15:11:26	jesse	I'm a lil worried I won't get into the human computer interaction class (which I hear is stupid easy), so I'm looking for other csc restricted electives... I might just do my research for credit to fill that spot. 
2018-03-28 15:34:49	gjabell	Yeah that seems like a better idea lol 
2018-03-28 15:35:26	jesse	sadly, that meeting time would conflict with software security (the one class that semester that I actually want to take) 
2018-03-28 15:36:04	gjabell	Ah 
2018-03-28 15:36:08	gjabell	You could do net sec 
2018-03-28 15:37:03	jesse	and theres the problem of maybe not being able to do human computer interaction (its already full)... I'm considering cloud computing though. have you taken that? 
2018-03-28 15:37:41	gjabell	Yeah I'm in it atm 
2018-03-28 15:37:58	jesse	this semester? 
2018-03-28 15:38:16	gjabell	yep 
2018-03-28 15:38:20	jesse	how is it? 
2018-03-28 15:38:37	gjabell	honestly, really easy and pretty boring xD 
2018-03-28 15:38:55	gjabell	I was hoping it'd be more sysadmin stuff but it's more of a general overview of cloud computing 
2018-03-28 15:39:00	gjabell	and most of it is super explanatory 
2018-03-28 15:39:17	jesse	do you have projects? 
2018-03-28 15:39:22	gjabell	not that I'd be able to tell you how to actually set up a decent cloud system, but I wouldn't be able to tell you that if I were paying attention either 
2018-03-28 15:39:26	gjabell	yeah, they are also really easy lol 
2018-03-28 15:39:36	gjabell	basically just set up a VLC instance and take some screenshots 
2018-03-28 15:39:46	gjabell	if you want an easy class it's good, otherwise it's not great 
2018-03-28 15:40:04	jesse	well, i think id rather take that than compiler theory. 
2018-03-28 15:40:25	gjabell	probably yeah 
2018-03-28 15:40:40	gjabell	I like the professor, he's super smart and is genuinely excited about the subject 
2018-03-28 15:40:45	gjabell	it's just soooo boring to sit in class 
2018-03-28 15:41:41	jesse	well thats what I was expecting from Human computer interaction xD 
2018-03-28 15:41:47	gjabell	true 
2018-03-28 15:42:29	jesse	have you taken applied diff eq? 
2018-03-28 15:42:46	gjabell	nope 
2018-03-28 15:42:54	jesse	ok 
2018-03-28 15:43:36	jesse	thanks galen!! I now have a somewhat reasonable schedule. 
2018-03-28 15:43:51	gjabell	np xD 
2018-03-28 15:49:17	jesse	I guess I now have to question if I want to continue my research for pay xD... or do it for cred and drop soft security. its a lil frustrating i'll miss all the meetings if I do software security. :( 
2018-03-28 15:49:42	gjabell	hmm yeah that kinda sucks 
2018-03-28 18:14:43	jesse	who are you living with next semester? 
2018-03-28 18:16:06	gjabell	stephen (one of my roommates atm), and two randoms because my other roommate fucked up and didnt accept our apartment thing 
2018-03-28 18:17:35	jesse	one of my roommates  screwed up that way and another of them is going to a different place, so we have 2 randos as well. 
2018-03-28 18:17:41	gjabell	rip 
2018-03-28 18:17:47	gjabell	too bad we can just switch them both out lol 
2018-03-28 18:18:21	jesse	don't you mean "cant"? 
2018-03-28 18:18:40	gjabell	yes 
2018-03-28 18:19:29	jesse	we actually dont have the other people assigned. Sam is still in his spot and im pretty sure the other room is unassigned. 
2018-03-28 18:19:50	gjabell	weird 
2018-03-28 18:19:56	gjabell	they assigned our really quickly, it was odd 
2018-03-28 18:20:24	jesse	you guys may be able to do a room swappy thing to get in here, but idk if housing would let us do that though 
2018-03-28 18:20:41	gjabell	yeah 
2018-03-28 18:21:00	gjabell	we're in the top floor which we requested bc of balcony, otherwise i'd try it 
2018-03-28 18:21:43	jesse	xD but youd have to carry groceries there... bottom floor is so much better. 
2018-03-28 18:21:51	gjabell	true... 
2018-03-28 18:21:55	gjabell	although there is an elevator 
2018-03-28 18:22:23	jesse	yeah, still not worth it in my opinion. lol 
2018-03-28 18:22:37	jesse	but I understand. 
2018-03-28 18:22:53	gjabell	yeah, it was mostly my roommate's idea 
2018-03-28 18:24:48	jesse	my roommates had a similar idea before they screwed themselves over. 
2018-03-28 18:26:24	gjabell	Lol 
2018-03-28 18:29:11	jesse	is it bad that im happy one of them is moving out? 
2018-03-28 18:34:42	gjabell	Eh, I don't think so
2018-03-28 18:34:42		Living with other people is hard 
2018-03-28 18:43:48	jesse	do you have problems with your roomies? 
2018-03-28 18:46:57	gjabell	not for the most part, we've known each other for a while so we're pretty ok all around 
2018-03-28 18:47:19	gjabell	it would be nice if they were a bit less bad about putting shit away in the kitchen after they use it but whatevs 
2018-03-28 18:50:41	jesse	gotcha.  mine are loud and never clean up after themselves. and they all bring their girlfriends over every weekend and I have to clean up after them too. 
2018-03-28 18:50:55	gjabell	eww 
2018-03-29 09:04:54	jesse	@jesse uploaded a file: https://sturgill-operators.slack.com/files/U3VPX29FW/F9XK6B2C9/1973.png (you) 
2018-03-29 10:10:45	gjabell	XD 
2018-03-29 10:10:48	gjabell	Pretty much lol 
2018-03-29 11:08:54	jesse	so my research professor was like "Jesse, we will move around all of our meetings just for you". 
2018-03-29 11:09:15	jesse	cuz im the only student that isnt graduating :) 
2018-03-29 11:10:09	gjabell	Eyy, nice 
2018-03-29 21:01:05	jesse	hey galen, if I wanted to build a linux box like the one you have, what would I need? where did  you get those parts? 
2018-03-29 21:21:44	gjabell	I got them from newegg and ebay 
2018-03-29 21:25:23	jesse	gotcha. thanks. im considering building one of those. :P probably over the summer tho... or sooner if I get bored haha. 
2018-03-29 21:35:19	gjabell	XD good choice haha 
2018-03-29 21:35:30	gjabell	I can send you the part list when I get back home 
2018-03-29 21:37:29	jesse	I would appreciate that!!

2018-03-29 22:08:40	gjabell	drive: https://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=9SIAAPK7855382&cm_re=256gb_nvme-_-0D9-0009-001S9-_-Product 
2018-03-29 22:08:54	gjabell	I already had the drive, so I didn't actually buy that specific one 
2018-03-29 22:09:10	gjabell	and I got the ram super cheap on ebay so I'm not sure if that's the exact model (or price) 
2018-03-29 22:09:56	gjabell	the case comes with a mobo built in, and it takes any LGA1151 cpu, but I didn't want to spend a bunch of money on it (plus it probably wouldn't run very cool), so I just went with a lower end pentium 
2018-03-30 08:57:55	jesse	huh. Thank you! how does it run in comparison to your laptop? 
2018-03-30 09:03:47	gjabell	Benchmarks say its maybe twice as good? But it's kinda hard to tell in the wild haha 
2018-03-30 09:03:59	gjabell	I don't have any issues tho 
2018-03-30 09:04:11	gjabell	Plus its driving 2 1440p screens like a champ 
2018-03-30 09:32:19	jesse	sounds good. I dont really do much gaming so its not really much of an issue if it isnt good enough for that. I just want something that I can add more RAM into :P 
2018-03-30 12:51:51	gjabell	I haven't tried gaming on it, don't imagine it'd be great, but maybe better than a laptop 
2018-03-30 12:54:14	gjabell	Since you don't already have a desktop it might be worth looking into a mini itx build or similar 
2018-03-30 12:54:19	jesse	xD I pretty much just play visual novels... and my laptop did fine. I was pretty into hollow knight though... but even thats just a 2d game that plays decently on my laptop. 
2018-03-30 12:54:52	gjabell	You won't be able to find something quite as small as the deskmini but it'll be more upgradable 
2018-03-30 12:55:02	gjabell	Plus if something breaks it's easier to replace 
2018-03-30 12:55:50	jesse	why wouldnt i be able to find it? didnt you just link to a store page? 
2018-03-30 12:58:16	jesse	i really just want something to program on and occasionally view videos without feeling like im abusing my laptop all the time... 
2018-03-30 12:59:35	gjabell	Ah
2018-03-30 12:59:35		I meant there aren't very many options for smaller cases 
2018-03-30 12:59:47	gjabell	That one is small BC it has a proprietary mobo 
2018-03-30 13:00:39	jesse	oh I gotcha. yeah I really liked that about your case. It was small but not too small to where I couldnt add more ram or disk space. 
2018-03-30 13:05:39	gjabell	Yeah
2018-03-30 13:05:39		Not sure if it actually has expansion space for more ram, so you'd need to buy whole new ram ubf 
2018-03-30 13:05:59	gjabell	With a mini itx you could get 2 sticks and upgrade to 4 later on 
2018-03-30 13:07:01	jesse	...but I could put in a bigger ram stick into that slot.... ive never had these luxuries with my laptop galen lol 
2018-03-30 13:07:53	gjabell	True, ram is super expensive ATM tho so it would be a lot of money to buy ram and then replace it xD just saying 
2018-03-30 13:08:12	gjabell	You can get some pretty small mini itx builds I think, at least height wise 
2018-03-30 13:08:45	gjabell	On the other hand the little case uses laptop ram so maybe you could find 32gb for cheap or somethinf 
2018-03-30 13:08:51	gjabell	Probably would last you a while 
2018-03-30 13:12:14	jesse	16 gigs of ram for my laptop would be around 150 dollars... 
2018-03-30 13:12:43	jesse	i think i misread your message though 
2018-03-30 13:14:48	jesse	16 gigs of ram would be more than enough for me i think 
2018-03-30 13:15:13	jesse	I thought you were suggesting just upgrading my laptop instead. 
2018-03-30 13:18:34	jesse	is laptop ram different from desktop ram? 
2018-03-30 13:20:11	gjabell	Yes, it's not as wide
2018-03-30 13:20:11		240 vs 288 pin I think? 
2018-03-30 13:20:44	gjabell	I was able to find 16 gigs on eBay for 100$ so you might get lucky and get it for cheap 
2018-03-30 13:21:03	gjabell	If you needed more it would start getting real expensive tho 
2018-03-30 13:21:13	gjabell	Since laptops don't typically have that much ram 
2018-03-30 13:32:59	jesse	I see what ya mean. 
2018-04-02 18:24:27	jesse	the whole tabs vs buffers thing seems pretty dumb to me. The 'vim experts' online are saying things like 'thats not how vim was designed' and when they talk about using buffers instead, theyre all like 'ok so you're going to need 8 plugins for this to work well'. 
2018-04-02 18:26:42	jesse	buffers seem pretty cool. tabs seem pretty cool. if you have the same file open in multiple tabs, thats kinda dumb. 
2018-04-02 18:27:56	gjabell	that's fair 
2018-04-02 18:28:12	gjabell	honestly whatever works for your workflow is more important anyways 
2018-04-02 18:28:29	gjabell	it might be that one has better performance or one has better support for plugins but until that is an issue it's w/e 
2018-04-02 18:29:09	jesse	xD yeah.  
2018-04-02 18:29:24	jesse	knowing buffers is still helpful though 
2018-04-02 18:33:54	gjabell	yeah 
2018-04-02 18:41:10	jesse	just checked it. opening the same files in different tabs just opens up the same buffer lol. 
2018-04-02 18:41:21	gjabell	lol xD 
2018-04-02 18:41:52	jesse	what a waste of my time haha  
2018-04-02 18:42:07	jesse	vsplit and split are gold though 
2018-04-02 18:42:21	jesse	and being able to navigate open buffers is pretty sweet 
2018-04-02 18:42:40	jesse	but the last 30 minutes has just been me questioning why people get emotionally charged over this haha 
2018-04-02 18:43:07	jesse	and thinking that there is some sort of reasoning beyond this. 
2018-04-02 18:43:55	gjabell	lol rip 
2018-04-02 18:44:08	gjabell	if you start using plugins at some point check out ctrl+P 
2018-04-02 18:44:12	gjabell	it's pretty sweet 
2018-04-02 18:46:26	jesse	that does seem pretty cool. But I do like to preserve my ability to program on servers that I do not have install permissions to. 
2018-04-02 18:47:00	gjabell	fair enough I guess, although if you have write access to your home directory (which hopefully you do), that's where all the plugins go 
2018-04-02 18:49:28	jesse	how are you installing you're plugins? 
2018-04-02 18:50:22	gjabell	I have a plugin manager called vim-plug 
2018-04-02 18:50:48	jesse	how did you install vim-plug? 
2018-04-02 18:50:54	jesse	:P 
2018-04-02 18:51:15	gjabell	and then my vimrc has some syntax for vim plug that tells it which plugins it should install and load 
2018-04-02 18:51:19	gjabell	and vim plug does the rest 
2018-04-02 18:51:20	gjabell	lemme check 
2018-04-02 18:51:52	jesse	although I'm sure I could find a way to install a vim plugin manager in the home directory if I really wanted to. 
2018-04-02 18:51:59	gjabell	curl -fLo ~/.vim/autoload/plug.vim --create-dirs \ 
2018-04-02 18:51:59	gjabell	https://raw.githubusercontent.com/junegunn/vim-plug/master/plug.vim 
2018-04-02 18:52:16	gjabell	that's for normal vim, tehre's another one for nvim 
2018-04-02 18:52:21	gjabell	not sure which you use 
2018-04-02 18:52:35	jesse	normal vim 
2018-04-02 18:52:36	gjabell	then in your vimrc you put: call plug#begin('~/.vim/plugged') 
2018-04-02 18:52:44	gjabell	then lines like Plug 'junegunn/vim-easy-align' 
2018-04-02 18:52:51	gjabell	then call plug#end() 
2018-04-02 18:53:14	gjabell	and when you do :PlugInstall it'll go grab all of the plguins in between the begin and end and install them for you 
2018-04-02 18:53:16	gjabell	it's super nice 
2018-04-02 18:53:20	gjabell	you can also do :PlugUpdate 
2018-04-02 18:53:25	gjabell	to update ones 
2018-04-02 18:53:44	jesse	well dang... now I have no reason to not use plugins... 
2018-04-02 18:53:51	gjabell	ikr 
2018-04-02 18:55:12	gjabell	https://pastebin.com/fGgZa15T
2018-04-02 18:55:12		[VIM] vimrc - Pastebin.com 
2018-04-02 18:55:17	gjabell	that's mine if you wanna take a look 
2018-04-02 18:55:23	gjabell	probably some extra stuff in it tho 
2018-04-02 18:55:40	gjabell	plus the plug#begin() will be a bit different bc I'm using nvim 
2018-04-02 18:56:44	jesse	lol thanks.  
2018-04-02 18:57:57	gjabell	most of it is copied btw, I'm really not that good at vim xD 
2018-04-02 19:00:48	jesse	everyone copies vim configs lol 
2018-04-02 19:01:06	gjabell	I guess they all stem from some masterconfig somewhere xD 
2018-04-02 19:01:12	jesse	also, chai green tea is really good. 
2018-04-02 19:01:17	gjabell	it sounds good 
2018-04-03 15:13:45	gjabell	when do you want to study for the exam? 
2018-04-03 15:14:18	jesse	omg youre soo neeedyyy 
2018-04-03 15:14:25	gjabell	lol xD 
2018-04-03 15:14:25	jesse	xD jk 
2018-04-03 16:41:37	jesse	meant to get back to this but I was working on a group project. Some time friday or this weekend maybe? or next tuesday anytime other than plm time? 
2018-04-03 16:42:00	gjabell	all good 
2018-04-03 16:42:13	gjabell	yeah that'd work, I should be pretty free other than the PLM project 
2018-04-04 17:59:11	jesse	would you recommend game design to anyone? I was just talking about it, and as I was explaining all the work we've had to do, I was starting to realize that its kinda a lot... what do you think? 
2018-04-04 17:59:53	gjabell	Yeah, I think so
2018-04-04 17:59:53		Its a bit of work but it's super low key work and you don't have to go to class lol 
2018-04-04 18:11:43	jesse	that is true... its a pain to me cuz I almost never skip class. 
2018-04-04 18:12:29	gjabell	You're missing out xD 
2018-04-04 18:13:15	jesse	right?! I've felt like all my time is being wasted for the past 30 lectures. and a lot of times, I'm just messing with my computer to pass the time. 
2018-04-04 18:13:50	gjabell	Just skip lol 
2018-04-04 18:14:58	jesse	ill probably skip on monday since it's just a review day (that she said would probably let out early anyway). 
2018-04-04 18:15:33	jesse	...but I might miss the teacher calling my name for participation credit :( 
2018-04-04 18:15:41	gjabell	Yeah I don't have my next class so I might just skip too lol 
2018-04-04 18:16:05	gjabell	We could study instead 
2018-04-04 18:16:22	jesse	that sounds like a pretty good idea. 
2018-04-04 18:16:54	gjabell	I can see if josh wants to join us too 
2018-04-04 18:17:15	jesse	sounds good. 
2018-04-04 20:54:02		getting channel history...
2018-03-26 10:29:38	jesse	fair point. lets say that its an easy B and if you want an A, consider taking the optional final to replace your lowest test grade. 
2018-03-26 10:29:54	gjabell	if it's that easy for a B I'm def interested lol 
2018-03-26 10:30:02	gjabell	I just want a humanities that I don't have to work for lol 
2018-03-26 10:31:27	jesse	but remember, you cant take it seriously. you have to take it as if youre Daniel and just get drunk before you start a reading xD 
2018-03-26 10:31:33	gjabell	loool 
2018-03-26 10:33:41	jesse	xD i miss that dude. he was funny. 
2018-03-26 10:34:09	gjabell	yeah, I haven't seen him much this semester 
2018-03-26 14:31:44	jesse	2nd test took me and my partner 3 hours. about half of the questions overlapped so working with him made the amount of work higher.
2018-03-26 14:31:44		anyway, it was a pain, and I wont know my grade till tomorrow. 
2018-03-26 14:32:04	gjabell	Rip 
2018-03-26 14:32:09	gjabell	Let me know how it goes lol 
2018-03-26 14:32:17	jesse	yup 
2018-03-28 14:41:25	jesse	I'm starting to use the command line tool timetrap to log my time working on work/school/fun stuff. If you're into gathering sort of data, you should check it out. it's a gem. 
2018-03-28 14:47:18	jesse	as in the ruby package manager gem.. 
2018-03-28 14:47:35	gjabell	Huh
2018-03-28 14:47:35		Lol xD 
2018-03-28 14:56:51	jesse	have you heard good things about the cryptography class? 
2018-03-28 15:01:23	gjabell	I've heard it's the hardest comp sci class here 
2018-03-28 15:01:44	jesse	:( I heard it was fun. 
2018-03-28 15:02:58	gjabell	XD idk, might be
2018-03-28 15:02:58		I just don't want to take something I'm not sure I'll do well in 
2018-03-28 15:11:26	jesse	I'm a lil worried I won't get into the human computer interaction class (which I hear is stupid easy), so I'm looking for other csc restricted electives... I might just do my research for credit to fill that spot. 
2018-03-28 15:34:49	gjabell	Yeah that seems like a better idea lol 
2018-03-28 15:35:26	jesse	sadly, that meeting time would conflict with software security (the one class that semester that I actually want to take) 
2018-03-28 15:36:04	gjabell	Ah 
2018-03-28 15:36:08	gjabell	You could do net sec 
2018-03-28 15:37:03	jesse	and theres the problem of maybe not being able to do human computer interaction (its already full)... I'm considering cloud computing though. have you taken that? 
2018-03-28 15:37:41	gjabell	Yeah I'm in it atm 
2018-03-28 15:37:58	jesse	this semester? 
2018-03-28 15:38:16	gjabell	yep 
2018-03-28 15:38:20	jesse	how is it? 
2018-03-28 15:38:37	gjabell	honestly, really easy and pretty boring xD 
2018-03-28 15:38:55	gjabell	I was hoping it'd be more sysadmin stuff but it's more of a general overview of cloud computing 
2018-03-28 15:39:00	gjabell	and most of it is super explanatory 
2018-03-28 15:39:17	jesse	do you have projects? 
2018-03-28 15:39:22	gjabell	not that I'd be able to tell you how to actually set up a decent cloud system, but I wouldn't be able to tell you that if I were paying attention either 
2018-03-28 15:39:26	gjabell	yeah, they are also really easy lol 
2018-03-28 15:39:36	gjabell	basically just set up a VLC instance and take some screenshots 
2018-03-28 15:39:46	gjabell	if you want an easy class it's good, otherwise it's not great 
2018-03-28 15:40:04	jesse	well, i think id rather take that than compiler theory. 
2018-03-28 15:40:25	gjabell	probably yeah 
2018-03-28 15:40:40	gjabell	I like the professor, he's super smart and is genuinely excited about the subject 
2018-03-28 15:40:45	gjabell	it's just soooo boring to sit in class 
2018-03-28 15:41:41	jesse	well thats what I was expecting from Human computer interaction xD 
2018-03-28 15:41:47	gjabell	true 
2018-03-28 15:42:29	jesse	have you taken applied diff eq? 
2018-03-28 15:42:46	gjabell	nope 
2018-03-28 15:42:54	jesse	ok 
2018-03-28 15:43:36	jesse	thanks galen!! I now have a somewhat reasonable schedule. 
2018-03-28 15:43:51	gjabell	np xD 
2018-03-28 15:49:17	jesse	I guess I now have to question if I want to continue my research for pay xD... or do it for cred and drop soft security. its a lil frustrating i'll miss all the meetings if I do software security. :( 
2018-03-28 15:49:42	gjabell	hmm yeah that kinda sucks 
2018-03-28 18:14:43	jesse	who are you living with next semester? 
2018-03-28 18:16:06	gjabell	stephen (one of my roommates atm), and two randoms because my other roommate fucked up and didnt accept our apartment thing 
2018-03-28 18:17:35	jesse	one of my roommates  screwed up that way and another of them is going to a different place, so we have 2 randos as well. 
2018-03-28 18:17:41	gjabell	rip 
2018-03-28 18:17:47	gjabell	too bad we can just switch them both out lol 
2018-03-28 18:18:21	jesse	don't you mean "cant"? 
2018-03-28 18:18:40	gjabell	yes 
2018-03-28 18:19:29	jesse	we actually dont have the other people assigned. Sam is still in his spot and im pretty sure the other room is unassigned. 
2018-03-28 18:19:50	gjabell	weird 
2018-03-28 18:19:56	gjabell	they assigned our really quickly, it was odd 
2018-03-28 18:20:24	jesse	you guys may be able to do a room swappy thing to get in here, but idk if housing would let us do that though 
2018-03-28 18:20:41	gjabell	yeah 
2018-03-28 18:21:00	gjabell	we're in the top floor which we requested bc of balcony, otherwise i'd try it 
2018-03-28 18:21:43	jesse	xD but youd have to carry groceries there... bottom floor is so much better. 
2018-03-28 18:21:51	gjabell	true... 
2018-03-28 18:21:55	gjabell	although there is an elevator 
2018-03-28 18:22:23	jesse	yeah, still not worth it in my opinion. lol 
2018-03-28 18:22:37	jesse	but I understand. 
2018-03-28 18:22:53	gjabell	yeah, it was mostly my roommate's idea 
2018-03-28 18:24:48	jesse	my roommates had a similar idea before they screwed themselves over. 
2018-03-28 18:26:24	gjabell	Lol 
2018-03-28 18:29:11	jesse	is it bad that im happy one of them is moving out? 
2018-03-28 18:34:42	gjabell	Eh, I don't think so
2018-03-28 18:34:42		Living with other people is hard 
2018-03-28 18:43:48	jesse	do you have problems with your roomies? 
2018-03-28 18:46:57	gjabell	not for the most part, we've known each other for a while so we're pretty ok all around 
2018-03-28 18:47:19	gjabell	it would be nice if they were a bit less bad about putting shit away in the kitchen after they use it but whatevs 
2018-03-28 18:50:41	jesse	gotcha.  mine are loud and never clean up after themselves. and they all bring their girlfriends over every weekend and I have to clean up after them too. 
2018-03-28 18:50:55	gjabell	eww 
2018-03-29 09:04:54	jesse	@jesse uploaded a file: https://sturgill-operators.slack.com/files/U3VPX29FW/F9XK6B2C9/1973.png (you) 
2018-03-29 10:10:45	gjabell	XD 
2018-03-29 10:10:48	gjabell	Pretty much lol 
2018-03-29 11:08:54	jesse	so my research professor was like "Jesse, we will move around all of our meetings just for you". 
2018-03-29 11:09:15	jesse	cuz im the only student that isnt graduating :) 
2018-03-29 11:10:09	gjabell	Eyy, nice 
2018-03-29 21:01:05	jesse	hey galen, if I wanted to build a linux box like the one you have, what would I need? where did  you get those parts? 
2018-03-29 21:21:44	gjabell	I got them from newegg and ebay 
2018-03-29 21:25:23	jesse	gotcha. thanks. im considering building one of those. :P probably over the summer tho... or sooner if I get bored haha. 
2018-03-29 21:35:19	gjabell	XD good choice haha 
2018-03-29 21:35:30	gjabell	I can send you the part list when I get back home 
2018-03-29 21:37:29	jesse	I would appreciate that!! 
2018-03-29 22:08:24	gjabell	case: https://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16856158048&cm_re=asrock_deskmini-_-56-158-048-_-Product

2018-03-29 22:08:36	gjabell	ram: https://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=9SIA4UB4WB5409&cm_re=crucial_ddr4_2133_sodimm_8gb-_-9SIA4UB4WB5409-_-Product 
2018-03-29 22:08:40	gjabell	drive: https://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=9SIAAPK7855382&cm_re=256gb_nvme-_-0D9-0009-001S9-_-Product 
2018-03-29 22:08:54	gjabell	I already had the drive, so I didn't actually buy that specific one 
2018-03-29 22:09:10	gjabell	and I got the ram super cheap on ebay so I'm not sure if that's the exact model (or price) 
2018-03-29 22:09:56	gjabell	the case comes with a mobo built in, and it takes any LGA1151 cpu, but I didn't want to spend a bunch of money on it (plus it probably wouldn't run very cool), so I just went with a lower end pentium 
2018-03-30 08:57:55	jesse	huh. Thank you! how does it run in comparison to your laptop? 
2018-03-30 09:03:47	gjabell	Benchmarks say its maybe twice as good? But it's kinda hard to tell in the wild haha 
2018-03-30 09:03:59	gjabell	I don't have any issues tho 
2018-03-30 09:04:11	gjabell	Plus its driving 2 1440p screens like a champ 
2018-03-30 09:32:19	jesse	sounds good. I dont really do much gaming so its not really much of an issue if it isnt good enough for that. I just want something that I can add more RAM into :P 
2018-03-30 12:51:51	gjabell	I haven't tried gaming on it, don't imagine it'd be great, but maybe better than a laptop 
2018-03-30 12:54:14	gjabell	Since you don't already have a desktop it might be worth looking into a mini itx build or similar 
2018-03-30 12:54:19	jesse	xD I pretty much just play visual novels... and my laptop did fine. I was pretty into hollow knight though... but even thats just a 2d game that plays decently on my laptop. 
2018-03-30 12:54:52	gjabell	You won't be able to find something quite as small as the deskmini but it'll be more upgradable 
2018-03-30 12:55:02	gjabell	Plus if something breaks it's easier to replace 
2018-03-30 12:55:50	jesse	why wouldnt i be able to find it? didnt you just link to a store page? 
2018-03-30 12:58:16	jesse	i really just want something to program on and occasionally view videos without feeling like im abusing my laptop all the time... 
2018-03-30 12:59:35	gjabell	Ah
2018-03-30 12:59:35		I meant there aren't very many options for smaller cases 
2018-03-30 12:59:47	gjabell	That one is small BC it has a proprietary mobo 
2018-03-30 13:00:39	jesse	oh I gotcha. yeah I really liked that about your case. It was small but not too small to where I couldnt add more ram or disk space. 
2018-03-30 13:05:39	gjabell	Yeah
2018-03-30 13:05:39		Not sure if it actually has expansion space for more ram, so you'd need to buy whole new ram ubf 
2018-03-30 13:05:59	gjabell	With a mini itx you could get 2 sticks and upgrade to 4 later on 
2018-03-30 13:07:01	jesse	...but I could put in a bigger ram stick into that slot.... ive never had these luxuries with my laptop galen lol 
2018-03-30 13:07:53	gjabell	True, ram is super expensive ATM tho so it would be a lot of money to buy ram and then replace it xD just saying 
2018-03-30 13:08:12	gjabell	You can get some pretty small mini itx builds I think, at least height wise 
2018-03-30 13:08:45	gjabell	On the other hand the little case uses laptop ram so maybe you could find 32gb for cheap or somethinf 
2018-03-30 13:08:51	gjabell	Probably would last you a while 
2018-03-30 13:12:14	jesse	16 gigs of ram for my laptop would be around 150 dollars... 
2018-03-30 13:12:43	jesse	i think i misread your message though 
2018-03-30 13:14:48	jesse	16 gigs of ram would be more than enough for me i think 
2018-03-30 13:15:13	jesse	I thought you were suggesting just upgrading my laptop instead. 
2018-03-30 13:18:34	jesse	is laptop ram different from desktop ram? 
2018-03-30 13:20:11	gjabell	Yes, it's not as wide
2018-03-30 13:20:11		240 vs 288 pin I think? 
2018-03-30 13:20:44	gjabell	I was able to find 16 gigs on eBay for 100$ so you might get lucky and get it for cheap 
2018-03-30 13:21:03	gjabell	If you needed more it would start getting real expensive tho 
2018-03-30 13:21:13	gjabell	Since laptops don't typically have that much ram 
2018-03-30 13:32:59	jesse	I see what ya mean. 
2018-04-02 18:24:27	jesse	the whole tabs vs buffers thing seems pretty dumb to me. The 'vim experts' online are saying things like 'thats not how vim was designed' and when they talk about using buffers instead, theyre all like 'ok so you're going to need 8 plugins for this to work well'. 
2018-04-02 18:26:42	jesse	buffers seem pretty cool. tabs seem pretty cool. if you have the same file open in multiple tabs, thats kinda dumb. 
2018-04-02 18:27:56	gjabell	that's fair 
2018-04-02 18:28:12	gjabell	honestly whatever works for your workflow is more important anyways 
2018-04-02 18:28:29	gjabell	it might be that one has better performance or one has better support for plugins but until that is an issue it's w/e 
2018-04-02 18:29:09	jesse	xD yeah.  
2018-04-02 18:29:24	jesse	knowing buffers is still helpful though 
2018-04-02 18:33:54	gjabell	yeah 
2018-04-02 18:41:10	jesse	just checked it. opening the same files in different tabs just opens up the same buffer lol. 
2018-04-02 18:41:21	gjabell	lol xD 
2018-04-02 18:41:52	jesse	what a waste of my time haha  
2018-04-02 18:42:07	jesse	vsplit and split are gold though 
2018-04-02 18:42:21	jesse	and being able to navigate open buffers is pretty sweet 
2018-04-02 18:42:40	jesse	but the last 30 minutes has just been me questioning why people get emotionally charged over this haha 
2018-04-02 18:43:07	jesse	and thinking that there is some sort of reasoning beyond this. 
2018-04-02 18:43:55	gjabell	lol rip 
2018-04-02 18:44:08	gjabell	if you start using plugins at some point check out ctrl+P 
2018-04-02 18:44:12	gjabell	it's pretty sweet 
2018-04-02 18:46:26	jesse	that does seem pretty cool. But I do like to preserve my ability to program on servers that I do not have install permissions to. 
2018-04-02 18:47:00	gjabell	fair enough I guess, although if you have write access to your home directory (which hopefully you do), that's where all the plugins go 
2018-04-02 18:49:28	jesse	how are you installing you're plugins? 
2018-04-02 18:50:22	gjabell	I have a plugin manager called vim-plug 
2018-04-02 18:50:48	jesse	how did you install vim-plug? 
2018-04-02 18:50:54	jesse	:P 
2018-04-02 18:51:15	gjabell	and then my vimrc has some syntax for vim plug that tells it which plugins it should install and load 
2018-04-02 18:51:19	gjabell	and vim plug does the rest 
2018-04-02 18:51:20	gjabell	lemme check 
2018-04-02 18:51:52	jesse	although I'm sure I could find a way to install a vim plugin manager in the home directory if I really wanted to. 
2018-04-02 18:51:59	gjabell	curl -fLo ~/.vim/autoload/plug.vim --create-dirs \ 
2018-04-02 18:51:59	gjabell	https://raw.githubusercontent.com/junegunn/vim-plug/master/plug.vim 
2018-04-02 18:52:16	gjabell	that's for normal vim, tehre's another one for nvim 
2018-04-02 18:52:21	gjabell	not sure which you use 
2018-04-02 18:52:35	jesse	normal vim 
2018-04-02 18:52:36	gjabell	then in your vimrc you put: call plug#begin('~/.vim/plugged') 
2018-04-02 18:52:44	gjabell	then lines like Plug 'junegunn/vim-easy-align' 
2018-04-02 18:52:51	gjabell	then call plug#end() 
2018-04-02 18:53:14	gjabell	and when you do :PlugInstall it'll go grab all of the plguins in between the begin and end and install them for you 
2018-04-02 18:53:16	gjabell	it's super nice 
2018-04-02 18:53:20	gjabell	you can also do :PlugUpdate 
2018-04-02 18:53:25	gjabell	to update ones 
2018-04-02 18:53:44	jesse	well dang... now I have no reason to not use plugins... 
2018-04-02 18:53:51	gjabell	ikr 
2018-04-02 18:55:12	gjabell	https://pastebin.com/fGgZa15T
2018-04-02 18:55:12		[VIM] vimrc - Pastebin.com 
2018-04-02 18:55:17	gjabell	that's mine if you wanna take a look 
2018-04-02 18:55:23	gjabell	probably some extra stuff in it tho 
2018-04-02 18:55:40	gjabell	plus the plug#begin() will be a bit different bc I'm using nvim 
2018-04-02 18:56:44	jesse	lol thanks.  
2018-04-02 18:57:57	gjabell	most of it is copied btw, I'm really not that good at vim xD 
2018-04-02 19:00:48	jesse	everyone copies vim configs lol 
2018-04-02 19:01:06	gjabell	I guess they all stem from some masterconfig somewhere xD 
2018-04-02 19:01:12	jesse	also, chai green tea is really good. 
2018-04-02 19:01:17	gjabell	it sounds good 
2018-04-03 15:13:45	gjabell	when do you want to study for the exam? 
2018-04-03 15:14:18	jesse	omg youre soo neeedyyy 
2018-04-03 15:14:25	gjabell	lol xD 
2018-04-03 15:14:25	jesse	xD jk 
2018-04-03 16:41:37	jesse	meant to get back to this but I was working on a group project. Some time friday or this weekend maybe? or next tuesday anytime other than plm time? 
2018-04-03 16:42:00	gjabell	all good 
2018-04-03 16:42:13	gjabell	yeah that'd work, I should be pretty free other than the PLM project 
2018-04-04 17:59:11	jesse	would you recommend game design to anyone? I was just talking about it, and as I was explaining all the work we've had to do, I was starting to realize that its kinda a lot... what do you think? 
2018-04-04 17:59:53	gjabell	Yeah, I think so
2018-04-04 17:59:53		Its a bit of work but it's super low key work and you don't have to go to class lol 
2018-04-04 18:11:43	jesse	that is true... its a pain to me cuz I almost never skip class. 
2018-04-04 18:12:29	gjabell	You're missing out xD 
2018-04-04 18:13:15	jesse	right?! I've felt like all my time is being wasted for the past 30 lectures. and a lot of times, I'm just messing with my computer to pass the time. 
2018-04-04 18:13:50	gjabell	Just skip lol 
2018-04-04 18:14:58	jesse	ill probably skip on monday since it's just a review day (that she said would probably let out early anyway). 
2018-04-04 18:15:33	jesse	...but I might miss the teacher calling my name for participation credit :( 
2018-04-04 18:15:41	gjabell	Yeah I don't have my next class so I might just skip too lol 
2018-04-04 18:16:05	gjabell	We could study instead 
2018-04-04 18:16:22	jesse	that sounds like a pretty good idea. 
2018-04-04 18:16:54	gjabell	I can see if josh wants to join us too 
2018-04-04 18:17:15	jesse	sounds good. 
2018-04-04 20:54:17	jesse	have you worked with regex in python? 
2018-04-04 20:55:00	jesse	maybe im goin crazy, but the re package seems SUPER buggy. 
2018-04-04 20:55:17	gjabell	A bit yea 
2018-04-04 20:55:22	gjabell	What's not working? 
2018-04-04 20:58:46	jesse	so re.search gets the first thing that matches the regex... but I want a list of everything that matches, and I'm trying to match on emails. So... 
2018-04-04 20:59:18	gjabell	I think there's a find all or similar 
2018-04-04 20:59:44	jesse	>>> re.search('\w+@(\w\.?)+', 'jlsimps4@ncsu.edu').group(0) 
2018-04-04 20:59:44	jesse	'jlsimps4@ncsu.edu' 
2018-04-04 20:59:56	jesse	that works fine... when I do findall: 
2018-04-04 21:00:25	jesse	>>> re.findall('\w+@(\w\.?)+', 'jlsimps4@ncsu.edu')          
2018-04-04 21:00:25	jesse	['u'] 
2018-04-04 21:00:43	jesse	it only ever matches on the last letter. 
2018-04-04 21:01:41	jesse	>>> re.findall('\w+@(\w\.?)+', 'jlsimps4@ncsu.edu   joshkayani@aol.org') 
2018-04-04 21:01:41	jesse	['u', 'g'] 
2018-04-04 21:03:37	gjabell	So it says if there are groups in the pattern return a list of groups 
2018-04-04 21:03:40	gjabell	For findall 
2018-04-04 21:03:51	gjabell	Not sure if that's relevant for this case 
2018-04-04 21:06:51	gjabell	Are you trying to match the domain? 
2018-04-04 21:08:01	jesse	match the whole email address 
2018-04-04 21:08:25	gjabell	Why the capture group then? 
2018-04-04 21:08:45	jesse	group(0) gets the string that is from the whole regex 
2018-04-04 21:09:02	jesse	group(1) would just be the first part, so \w+ 
2018-04-04 21:09:12	gjabell	oh 
2018-04-04 21:09:38	gjabell	findall returns a list of groups 
2018-04-04 21:09:43	gjabell	so it's just returning the last group 
2018-04-04 21:09:48	gjabell	(\w\.?) 
2018-04-04 21:09:53	gjabell	which is the last letter 
2018-04-04 21:11:17	gjabell	are you trying to match emails in a large block of text? 
2018-04-04 21:11:40	jesse	yup 
2018-04-04 21:12:18	gjabell	how about re.findall('(\w+@\w+)') 
2018-04-04 21:13:00	gjabell	or maybe re.findall('(\w+@\w+\.\w+') 
2018-04-04 21:13:06	gjabell	so make sure it ends with something.something 
2018-04-04 21:15:25	jesse	I added the . in there to match my case.. I used '\w+@[\w\.]+' since there could be any number of periods.  
2018-04-04 21:15:52	gjabell	ah 
2018-04-04 21:16:14	jesse	it seems to work now. idk why it didn't work before though 
2018-04-04 21:16:25	gjabell	yea idk 
2018-04-04 21:16:37	jesse	maybe I should just avoid question marks 
2018-04-04 21:16:40	gjabell	I always have to lookup the regex docs for python lol 
2018-04-04 21:16:52	gjabell	were you trying to do optionals 
2018-04-04 21:16:53	gjabell	? 
2018-04-04 21:17:42	jesse	yeah, it was in my first regex I sent ya 
2018-04-04 21:17:56	gjabell	ah 
2018-04-04 21:18:07	gjabell	pretty sure ? inside group is 0 or 1 
2018-04-04 21:18:22	gjabell	if you want an optional capture group it's (?:stuff) 
2018-04-04 21:18:26	gjabell	I think 
2018-04-04 21:19:30	gjabell	wait nm 
2018-04-04 21:19:33	gjabell	that's non capturing 
2018-04-04 21:19:37	jesse	the zero or one is what I wanted. 
2018-04-04 21:19:41	gjabell	ok 
2018-04-06 14:50:57		getting channel history...
2018-03-28 18:22:53	gjabell	yeah, it was mostly my roommate's idea 
2018-03-28 18:24:48	jesse	my roommates had a similar idea before they screwed themselves over. 
2018-03-28 18:26:24	gjabell	Lol 
2018-03-28 18:29:11	jesse	is it bad that im happy one of them is moving out? 
2018-03-28 18:34:42	gjabell	Eh, I don't think so
2018-03-28 18:34:42		Living with other people is hard 
2018-03-28 18:43:48	jesse	do you have problems with your roomies? 
2018-03-28 18:46:57	gjabell	not for the most part, we've known each other for a while so we're pretty ok all around 
2018-03-28 18:47:19	gjabell	it would be nice if they were a bit less bad about putting shit away in the kitchen after they use it but whatevs 
2018-03-28 18:50:41	jesse	gotcha.  mine are loud and never clean up after themselves. and they all bring their girlfriends over every weekend and I have to clean up after them too. 
2018-03-28 18:50:55	gjabell	eww 
2018-03-29 09:04:54	jesse	@jesse uploaded a file: https://sturgill-operators.slack.com/files/U3VPX29FW/F9XK6B2C9/1973.png (you) 
2018-03-29 10:10:45	gjabell	XD 
2018-03-29 10:10:48	gjabell	Pretty much lol 
2018-03-29 11:08:54	jesse	so my research professor was like "Jesse, we will move around all of our meetings just for you". 
2018-03-29 11:09:15	jesse	cuz im the only student that isnt graduating :) 
2018-03-29 11:10:09	gjabell	Eyy, nice 
2018-03-29 21:01:05	jesse	hey galen, if I wanted to build a linux box like the one you have, what would I need? where did  you get those parts? 
2018-03-29 21:21:44	gjabell	I got them from newegg and ebay 
2018-03-29 21:25:23	jesse	gotcha. thanks. im considering building one of those. :P probably over the summer tho... or sooner if I get bored haha. 
2018-03-29 21:35:19	gjabell	XD good choice haha 
2018-03-29 21:35:30	gjabell	I can send you the part list when I get back home 
2018-03-29 21:37:29	jesse	I would appreciate that!! 
2018-03-29 22:08:24	gjabell	case: https://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16856158048&cm_re=asrock_deskmini-_-56-158-048-_-Product

2018-03-29 22:08:40	gjabell	drive: https://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=9SIAAPK7855382&cm_re=256gb_nvme-_-0D9-0009-001S9-_-Product 
2018-03-29 22:08:54	gjabell	I already had the drive, so I didn't actually buy that specific one 
2018-03-29 22:09:10	gjabell	and I got the ram super cheap on ebay so I'm not sure if that's the exact model (or price) 
2018-03-29 22:09:56	gjabell	the case comes with a mobo built in, and it takes any LGA1151 cpu, but I didn't want to spend a bunch of money on it (plus it probably wouldn't run very cool), so I just went with a lower end pentium 
2018-03-30 08:57:55	jesse	huh. Thank you! how does it run in comparison to your laptop? 
2018-03-30 09:03:47	gjabell	Benchmarks say its maybe twice as good? But it's kinda hard to tell in the wild haha 
2018-03-30 09:03:59	gjabell	I don't have any issues tho 
2018-03-30 09:04:11	gjabell	Plus its driving 2 1440p screens like a champ 
2018-03-30 09:32:19	jesse	sounds good. I dont really do much gaming so its not really much of an issue if it isnt good enough for that. I just want something that I can add more RAM into :P 
2018-03-30 12:51:51	gjabell	I haven't tried gaming on it, don't imagine it'd be great, but maybe better than a laptop 
2018-03-30 12:54:14	gjabell	Since you don't already have a desktop it might be worth looking into a mini itx build or similar 
2018-03-30 12:54:19	jesse	xD I pretty much just play visual novels... and my laptop did fine. I was pretty into hollow knight though... but even thats just a 2d game that plays decently on my laptop. 
2018-03-30 12:54:52	gjabell	You won't be able to find something quite as small as the deskmini but it'll be more upgradable 
2018-03-30 12:55:02	gjabell	Plus if something breaks it's easier to replace 
2018-03-30 12:55:50	jesse	why wouldnt i be able to find it? didnt you just link to a store page? 
2018-03-30 12:58:16	jesse	i really just want something to program on and occasionally view videos without feeling like im abusing my laptop all the time... 
2018-03-30 12:59:35	gjabell	Ah
2018-03-30 12:59:35		I meant there aren't very many options for smaller cases 
2018-03-30 12:59:47	gjabell	That one is small BC it has a proprietary mobo 
2018-03-30 13:00:39	jesse	oh I gotcha. yeah I really liked that about your case. It was small but not too small to where I couldnt add more ram or disk space. 
2018-03-30 13:05:39	gjabell	Yeah
2018-03-30 13:05:39		Not sure if it actually has expansion space for more ram, so you'd need to buy whole new ram ubf 
2018-03-30 13:05:59	gjabell	With a mini itx you could get 2 sticks and upgrade to 4 later on 
2018-03-30 13:07:01	jesse	...but I could put in a bigger ram stick into that slot.... ive never had these luxuries with my laptop galen lol 
2018-03-30 13:07:53	gjabell	True, ram is super expensive ATM tho so it would be a lot of money to buy ram and then replace it xD just saying 
2018-03-30 13:08:12	gjabell	You can get some pretty small mini itx builds I think, at least height wise 
2018-03-30 13:08:45	gjabell	On the other hand the little case uses laptop ram so maybe you could find 32gb for cheap or somethinf 
2018-03-30 13:08:51	gjabell	Probably would last you a while 
2018-03-30 13:12:14	jesse	16 gigs of ram for my laptop would be around 150 dollars... 
2018-03-30 13:12:43	jesse	i think i misread your message though 
2018-03-30 13:14:48	jesse	16 gigs of ram would be more than enough for me i think 
2018-03-30 13:15:13	jesse	I thought you were suggesting just upgrading my laptop instead. 
2018-03-30 13:18:34	jesse	is laptop ram different from desktop ram? 
2018-03-30 13:20:11	gjabell	Yes, it's not as wide
2018-03-30 13:20:11		240 vs 288 pin I think? 
2018-03-30 13:20:44	gjabell	I was able to find 16 gigs on eBay for 100$ so you might get lucky and get it for cheap 
2018-03-30 13:21:03	gjabell	If you needed more it would start getting real expensive tho 
2018-03-30 13:21:13	gjabell	Since laptops don't typically have that much ram 
2018-03-30 13:32:59	jesse	I see what ya mean. 
2018-04-02 18:24:27	jesse	the whole tabs vs buffers thing seems pretty dumb to me. The 'vim experts' online are saying things like 'thats not how vim was designed' and when they talk about using buffers instead, theyre all like 'ok so you're going to need 8 plugins for this to work well'. 
2018-04-02 18:26:42	jesse	buffers seem pretty cool. tabs seem pretty cool. if you have the same file open in multiple tabs, thats kinda dumb. 
2018-04-02 18:27:56	gjabell	that's fair 
2018-04-02 18:28:12	gjabell	honestly whatever works for your workflow is more important anyways 
2018-04-02 18:28:29	gjabell	it might be that one has better performance or one has better support for plugins but until that is an issue it's w/e 
2018-04-02 18:29:09	jesse	xD yeah.  
2018-04-02 18:29:24	jesse	knowing buffers is still helpful though 
2018-04-02 18:33:54	gjabell	yeah 
2018-04-02 18:41:10	jesse	just checked it. opening the same files in different tabs just opens up the same buffer lol. 
2018-04-02 18:41:21	gjabell	lol xD 
2018-04-02 18:41:52	jesse	what a waste of my time haha  
2018-04-02 18:42:07	jesse	vsplit and split are gold though 
2018-04-02 18:42:21	jesse	and being able to navigate open buffers is pretty sweet 
2018-04-02 18:42:40	jesse	but the last 30 minutes has just been me questioning why people get emotionally charged over this haha 
2018-04-02 18:43:07	jesse	and thinking that there is some sort of reasoning beyond this. 
2018-04-02 18:43:55	gjabell	lol rip 
2018-04-02 18:44:08	gjabell	if you start using plugins at some point check out ctrl+P 
2018-04-02 18:44:12	gjabell	it's pretty sweet 
2018-04-02 18:46:26	jesse	that does seem pretty cool. But I do like to preserve my ability to program on servers that I do not have install permissions to. 
2018-04-02 18:47:00	gjabell	fair enough I guess, although if you have write access to your home directory (which hopefully you do), that's where all the plugins go 
2018-04-02 18:49:28	jesse	how are you installing you're plugins? 
2018-04-02 18:50:22	gjabell	I have a plugin manager called vim-plug 
2018-04-02 18:50:48	jesse	how did you install vim-plug? 
2018-04-02 18:50:54	jesse	:P 
2018-04-02 18:51:15	gjabell	and then my vimrc has some syntax for vim plug that tells it which plugins it should install and load 
2018-04-02 18:51:19	gjabell	and vim plug does the rest 
2018-04-02 18:51:20	gjabell	lemme check 
2018-04-02 18:51:52	jesse	although I'm sure I could find a way to install a vim plugin manager in the home directory if I really wanted to. 
2018-04-02 18:51:59	gjabell	curl -fLo ~/.vim/autoload/plug.vim --create-dirs \ 
2018-04-02 18:51:59	gjabell	https://raw.githubusercontent.com/junegunn/vim-plug/master/plug.vim 
2018-04-02 18:52:16	gjabell	that's for normal vim, tehre's another one for nvim 
2018-04-02 18:52:21	gjabell	not sure which you use 
2018-04-02 18:52:35	jesse	normal vim 
2018-04-02 18:52:36	gjabell	then in your vimrc you put: call plug#begin('~/.vim/plugged') 
2018-04-02 18:52:44	gjabell	then lines like Plug 'junegunn/vim-easy-align' 
2018-04-02 18:52:51	gjabell	then call plug#end() 
2018-04-02 18:53:14	gjabell	and when you do :PlugInstall it'll go grab all of the plguins in between the begin and end and install them for you 
2018-04-02 18:53:16	gjabell	it's super nice 
2018-04-02 18:53:20	gjabell	you can also do :PlugUpdate 
2018-04-02 18:53:25	gjabell	to update ones 
2018-04-02 18:53:44	jesse	well dang... now I have no reason to not use plugins... 
2018-04-02 18:53:51	gjabell	ikr 
2018-04-02 18:55:12	gjabell	https://pastebin.com/fGgZa15T
2018-04-02 18:55:12		[VIM] vimrc - Pastebin.com 
2018-04-02 18:55:17	gjabell	that's mine if you wanna take a look 
2018-04-02 18:55:23	gjabell	probably some extra stuff in it tho 
2018-04-02 18:55:40	gjabell	plus the plug#begin() will be a bit different bc I'm using nvim 
2018-04-02 18:56:44	jesse	lol thanks.  
2018-04-02 18:57:57	gjabell	most of it is copied btw, I'm really not that good at vim xD 
2018-04-02 19:00:48	jesse	everyone copies vim configs lol 
2018-04-02 19:01:06	gjabell	I guess they all stem from some masterconfig somewhere xD 
2018-04-02 19:01:12	jesse	also, chai green tea is really good. 
2018-04-02 19:01:17	gjabell	it sounds good 
2018-04-03 15:13:45	gjabell	when do you want to study for the exam? 
2018-04-03 15:14:18	jesse	omg youre soo neeedyyy 
2018-04-03 15:14:25	gjabell	lol xD 
2018-04-03 15:14:25	jesse	xD jk 
2018-04-03 16:41:37	jesse	meant to get back to this but I was working on a group project. Some time friday or this weekend maybe? or next tuesday anytime other than plm time? 
2018-04-03 16:42:00	gjabell	all good 
2018-04-03 16:42:13	gjabell	yeah that'd work, I should be pretty free other than the PLM project 
2018-04-04 17:59:11	jesse	would you recommend game design to anyone? I was just talking about it, and as I was explaining all the work we've had to do, I was starting to realize that its kinda a lot... what do you think? 
2018-04-04 17:59:53	gjabell	Yeah, I think so
2018-04-04 17:59:53		Its a bit of work but it's super low key work and you don't have to go to class lol 
2018-04-04 18:11:43	jesse	that is true... its a pain to me cuz I almost never skip class. 
2018-04-04 18:12:29	gjabell	You're missing out xD 
2018-04-04 18:13:15	jesse	right?! I've felt like all my time is being wasted for the past 30 lectures. and a lot of times, I'm just messing with my computer to pass the time. 
2018-04-04 18:13:50	gjabell	Just skip lol 
2018-04-04 18:14:58	jesse	ill probably skip on monday since it's just a review day (that she said would probably let out early anyway). 
2018-04-04 18:15:33	jesse	...but I might miss the teacher calling my name for participation credit :( 
2018-04-04 18:15:41	gjabell	Yeah I don't have my next class so I might just skip too lol 
2018-04-04 18:16:05	gjabell	We could study instead 
2018-04-04 18:16:22	jesse	that sounds like a pretty good idea. 
2018-04-04 18:16:54	gjabell	I can see if josh wants to join us too 
2018-04-04 18:17:15	jesse	sounds good. 
2018-04-04 20:54:17	jesse	have you worked with regex in python? 
2018-04-04 20:55:00	jesse	maybe im goin crazy, but the re package seems SUPER buggy. 
2018-04-04 20:55:17	gjabell	A bit yea 
2018-04-04 20:55:22	gjabell	What's not working? 
2018-04-04 20:58:46	jesse	so re.search gets the first thing that matches the regex... but I want a list of everything that matches, and I'm trying to match on emails. So... 
2018-04-04 20:59:18	gjabell	I think there's a find all or similar 
2018-04-04 20:59:44	jesse	>>> re.search('\w+@(\w\.?)+', 'mailto:jlsimps4@ncsu.edu (jlsimps4@ncsu.edu)').group(0) 
2018-04-04 20:59:44	jesse	'mailto:jlsimps4@ncsu.edu (jlsimps4@ncsu.edu)' 
2018-04-04 20:59:56	jesse	that works fine... when I do findall: 
2018-04-04 21:00:25	jesse	>>> re.findall('\w+@(\w\.?)+', 'mailto:jlsimps4@ncsu.edu (jlsimps4@ncsu.edu)')          
2018-04-04 21:00:25	jesse	['u'] 
2018-04-04 21:00:43	jesse	it only ever matches on the last letter. 
2018-04-04 21:01:41	jesse	>>> re.findall('\w+@(\w\.?)+', 'mailto:jlsimps4@ncsu.edu (jlsimps4@ncsu.edu)   mailto:joshkayani@aol.org (joshkayani@aol.org)') 
2018-04-04 21:01:41	jesse	['u', 'g'] 
2018-04-04 21:03:37	gjabell	So it says if there are groups in the pattern return a list of groups 
2018-04-04 21:03:40	gjabell	For findall 
2018-04-04 21:03:51	gjabell	Not sure if that's relevant for this case 
2018-04-04 21:06:51	gjabell	Are you trying to match the domain? 
2018-04-04 21:08:01	jesse	match the whole email address 
2018-04-04 21:08:25	gjabell	Why the capture group then? 
2018-04-04 21:08:45	jesse	group(0) gets the string that is from the whole regex 
2018-04-04 21:09:02	jesse	group(1) would just be the first part, so \w+ 
2018-04-04 21:09:12	gjabell	oh 
2018-04-04 21:09:38	gjabell	findall returns a list of groups 
2018-04-04 21:09:43	gjabell	so it's just returning the last group 
2018-04-04 21:09:48	gjabell	(\w\.?) 
2018-04-04 21:09:53	gjabell	which is the last letter 
2018-04-04 21:11:17	gjabell	are you trying to match emails in a large block of text? 
2018-04-04 21:11:40	jesse	yup 
2018-04-04 21:12:18	gjabell	how about re.findall('(\w+@\w+)') 
2018-04-04 21:13:00	gjabell	or maybe re.findall('(\w+@\w+\.\w+') 
2018-04-04 21:13:06	gjabell	so make sure it ends with something.something 
2018-04-04 21:15:25	jesse	I added the . in there to match my case.. I used '\w+@[\w\.]+' since there could be any number of periods.  
2018-04-04 21:15:52	gjabell	ah 
2018-04-04 21:16:14	jesse	it seems to work now. idk why it didn't work before though 
2018-04-04 21:16:25	gjabell	yea idk 
2018-04-04 21:16:37	jesse	maybe I should just avoid question marks 
2018-04-04 21:16:40	gjabell	I always have to lookup the regex docs for python lol 
2018-04-04 21:16:52	gjabell	were you trying to do optionals 
2018-04-04 21:16:53	gjabell	? 
2018-04-04 21:17:42	jesse	yeah, it was in my first regex I sent ya 
2018-04-04 21:17:56	gjabell	ah 
2018-04-04 21:18:07	gjabell	pretty sure ? inside group is 0 or 1 
2018-04-04 21:18:22	gjabell	if you want an optional capture group it's (?:stuff) 
2018-04-04 21:18:26	gjabell	I think

2018-04-04 21:34:45	gjabell	No ordinaries here

2018-04-06 10:19:06	jesse	cool program ^ maybe my next raspberry pi project will use this. 
2018-04-06 10:20:01	gjabell	that's neat xD 
2018-04-06 10:20:07	gjabell	kinda want to try that now 
2018-04-06 10:22:42	jesse	sweet. Ive got homework to do, but if you do something cool, let me know haha 
2018-04-06 10:23:00	gjabell	I will haha, not sure if I'll get around to it today 
2018-04-06 10:24:17	jesse	lol okay. i might play with it tomorrow, but I'm pretty stacked on work so idk. 
2018-04-06 10:24:23	gjabell	yeah 
2018-04-06 10:28:57	jesse	btw, my research group found out that some web scraping tools in python by default ignore robots.txt ... which is really bad lol 
2018-04-06 10:29:03	gjabell	riip 
2018-04-06 15:24:32	jesse	I was looking into getting a domain name from google, and jessesimpson.com is taken :(  ... I'll need to find something like XxNinjaHackMasterButN0tRly23xX.org or something xD 
2018-04-06 15:24:49	gjabell	lol xD 
2018-04-06 15:25:01	jesse	it's gotta be more inconvenient than an ip address lol 
2018-04-06 15:25:16	gjabell	xD 
2018-04-06 15:25:21	gjabell	what's your middle initial 
2018-04-06 15:25:35	jesse	L 
2018-04-06 15:26:14	gjabell	hmm 
2018-04-06 15:26:20	gjabell	http://jlsimpson.com (jlsimpson.com) is taken 
2018-04-06 15:26:29	gjabell	http://jesselsimpson.com (jesselsimpson.com) isn't although it's a bit more confusing 
2018-04-06 15:26:37	gjabell	http://jls.com (jls.com) is too 
2018-04-06 15:26:47	gjabell	you could do http://jlscode.com (jlscode.com) 
2018-04-06 15:27:43	jesse	that one's not bad. 
2018-04-06 15:28:00	gjabell	http://jessesimpson.io (jessesimpson.io) is also but it's $60 a year 
2018-04-06 15:28:07	gjabell	which still isn't too bad but maybe not worth 
2018-04-06 15:28:16	jesse	well I do have jessesimpson36.github.io xD 
2018-04-06 15:28:52	gjabell	http://jessesimpson36.com (jessesimpson36.com) is available xD 
2018-04-06 15:28:56	gjabell	why 36? 
2018-04-06 15:29:03	jesse	thats my github name 
2018-04-06 15:29:06	gjabell	ah 
2018-04-06 15:29:14	jesse	and my favorite number. 
2018-04-06 15:29:24	jesse	because it's my second favorite number squared... 
2018-04-06 15:29:28	gjabell	lol xD 
2018-04-06 15:29:39	gjabell	or maybe your second favorite number is your favorite number sqrted 
2018-04-06 15:29:48	gjabell	you could do http://jessesimps0n.com (jessesimps0n.com) lol 
2018-04-06 15:30:08	jesse	xD I'll just take the ip address if thats what im working with haha 
2018-04-06 15:30:18	gjabell	haha yeah 
2018-04-06 15:30:24	gjabell	probably less cringy lol 
2018-04-06 15:31:45	gjabell	you could do http://jessetheteadrinker.com (jessetheteadrinker.com) 
2018-04-06 15:31:51	gjabell	:P 
2018-04-06 15:32:39	jesse	lol  leeteaformea.com 
2018-04-06 15:33:01	jesse	cuz my middle name is lee 
2018-04-06 15:34:00	gjabell	why the a 
2018-04-06 15:34:32	jesse	cuz i wanted it to rhyme with tea ... and im stupid 
2018-04-06 15:34:49	gjabell	xD 
2018-04-06 15:34:57	gjabell	tee-uh 
2018-04-06 15:35:12	gjabell	you could get jessesimpson.codes for $50 a year 
2018-04-06 15:35:17	gjabell	that almost seems worth lol 
2018-04-06 15:35:42	gjabell	or go for a .me ending: http://leeteafor.me (leeteafor.me) 
2018-04-06 15:35:57	jesse	why is there an 's' on the end of code though?  
2018-04-06 15:35:58	gjabell	how about jessesimpson.coupons 
2018-04-06 15:36:01	jesse	xDDD 
2018-04-06 15:36:05	gjabell	idk, .code isn't available lol 
2018-04-06 15:36:16	gjabell	but I actually like the s, since you are coding 
2018-04-06 15:36:21	gjabell	hence, jesse simpson codes 
2018-04-06 15:37:17	jesse	yeah but 50$ a year makes me sad. that is a pretty good one though 
2018-04-06 15:37:28	gjabell	yeah that's the only downside 
2018-04-06 15:37:42	gjabell	you could do http://jessesimpsoncode.com (jessesimpsoncode.com) 
2018-04-06 15:37:52	gjabell	or http://jessesimpsoncodes.com (jessesimpsoncodes.com) 
2018-04-06 15:39:41	jesse	I might go with that one honestly. 
2018-04-06 15:39:51	gjabell	heck, just http://jessecode.com (jessecode.com) is available lol 
2018-04-06 15:40:07	gjabell	jessecodes isn't unf 
2018-04-06 15:40:34	gjabell	jessesimpson.computer is $30 a year xD 
2018-04-06 15:40:40	jesse	yeah I was checking jessecodes haha 
2018-04-06 15:42:21	jesse	jessehacks.com is available. 
2018-04-06 15:42:50	gjabell	that's not bad 
2018-04-06 15:43:04	gjabell	although I'm not sure if that's necessarily a good one for business purposes haha 
2018-04-06 15:43:09	gjabell	people are ignorant :P 
2018-04-06 15:45:27	jesse	for the most part, I really just want it for screwing around with raspberry pi stuff. I don't really care about business purposes... but if they saw whatever i'm doing anyway, I guess it could be bad. 
2018-04-06 15:46:03	gjabell	that's fair, I'm thinking more if you end up hosting your website on it and are doing freelance work 
2018-04-06 15:46:15	gjabell	people are stupid, they might be less likely to hire someone if they think they are a 'hacker' 
2018-04-06 15:46:22	jesse	is that your goal for gjabell.com? 
2018-04-06 15:46:27	gjabell	I think the codes one would be better 
2018-04-06 15:46:40	gjabell	I have http://galenabell.com (galenabell.com), but yeah xD 
2018-04-06 15:46:50	gjabell	I need to get my website up again, just need to figure out what I want on it lol 
2018-04-06 15:47:12	gjabell	it's nice to have an actual domain tho bc you can do some neat stuff with subdomains 
2018-04-06 15:47:24	gjabell	so like http://git.galenabell.com (git.galenabell.com) goes to my gitlab, and http://plex.galenabell.com (plex.galenabell.com) goes to my plex 
2018-04-06 15:47:30	gjabell	I used to have others but they aren't up atm 
2018-04-06 15:50:49	jesse	Yeah. I'd like to be able to do something like that.  
2018-04-06 15:51:23	gjabell	i'd just get something you'd be comfortable using as your professional website domain 
2018-04-06 15:51:29	gjabell	and make subdomains off that 
2018-04-06 15:53:03	jesse	yeah. jessesimpsoncodes is good for that. maybe a little long but I guess it has to be since literally everything is taken lol 
2018-04-06 15:53:45	gjabell	haha yeah 
2018-04-06 15:53:54	gjabell	I think it's good tho bc it's pretty obvious what it is 
2018-04-06 15:54:09	gjabell	and it's easier to remember than some random 5 letter acronym or something lol 
2018-04-06 15:56:45	jesse	I agree. Thanks for the name galen!!! :P 
2018-04-06 15:57:23	gjabell	np :) 
2018-04-06 15:57:32	gjabell	let me know how it goes 
2018-04-06 16:33:21	jesse	you used cloudflare for ddns stuff right? 
2018-04-06 16:33:47	gjabell	yeah although you could also just use google's api if you got it through google domains 
2018-04-06 16:34:08	gjabell	I switched to cloudflare bc I couldn't get something to work with google's apis lol 
2018-04-06 16:36:10	jesse	meh. I trust your intuition. 
2018-04-06 16:36:22	gjabell	fair enough xD 
2018-04-06 16:36:34	gjabell	I like the idea of anti-ddos even though I doubt it will be an issue 
2018-04-06 16:36:38	gjabell	plus cloudflare also has a nice api 
2018-04-06 16:40:09	jesse	theres a lot of acronyms on the DNS part of the site  
2018-04-06 16:40:34	gjabell	lol yeah xD 
2018-04-06 16:40:38	gjabell	for cloudflare you mean? 
2018-04-06 16:41:23	jesse	yep 
2018-04-06 16:41:45	jesse	A AAAA CNAME, etc. its kinda confusing to me. 
2018-04-06 16:41:58	gjabell	ah, yeah 
2018-04-06 16:42:22	gjabell	so an 'A' record is basically a pointer from a domain name to an IP address 
2018-04-06 16:42:42	gjabell	ie http://galenabell.com (galenabell.com) -> 152.... yadda yadda 
2018-04-06 16:42:53	gjabell	AAAA records are the same as A records but for IPv6 
2018-04-06 16:43:04	gjabell	CNAME is an alias 
2018-04-06 16:43:16	gjabell	so on mine I have an A record from http://galenabell.com (galenabell.com) to my IP 
2018-04-06 16:43:24	gjabell	and I have a CNAME record from * to http://galenabell.com (galenabell.com) 
2018-04-06 16:43:53	gjabell	which basically says, if anyone goes to *.http://galenabell.com (galenabell.com) (any subdomain), direct them instead to http://galenabell.com (galenabell.com) (or whatever the IP it points at is) 
2018-04-06 16:44:13	gjabell	and I have another one from www to http://galenabell.com (galenabell.com), so http://www.galenabell.com (www.galenabell.com) and just http://galenabell.com (galenabell.com) go to the same thing 
2018-04-06 16:44:41	gjabell	MX records are for mail servers, so you don't need to worry about those unless you are doing mail stuff (or have a website gmail account, etc) 
2018-04-06 16:45:12	gjabell	TXT records are basically just plaintext things you can stick onto domains, thye don't actually do anything for DNS lookup but you can use them for metadata and the like 
2018-04-06 16:45:34	gjabell	NS records are for specifying which DNS provider has the domain records 
2018-04-06 16:45:56	jesse	gootttchhhaaaa.. 
2018-04-06 16:46:02	gjabell	I haven't used any of the others tbh, but I imagine they have some use 
2018-04-06 16:46:33	gjabell	I can send you a screenshot of my cloudflare setup real quick 
2018-04-06 16:47:27	gjabell	@gjabell uploaded a file: https://sturgill-operators.slack.com/files/U5AUU7HHA/FA2NNLGHG/2018-04-06-164647_987x925_scrot.png (2018-04-06-164647 987x925 scrot) 
2018-04-06 16:47:41	gjabell	there's a bunch of extra stuff on there bc of the MX records 
2018-04-06 16:47:47	gjabell	but the top ones should give a bit of an idea 
2018-04-06 16:52:08	jesse	yeah it just doesn't seem to be working right. going to the domain name doesn't pull up the website im hosting. 
2018-04-06 16:52:30	gjabell	can you SS your cloudflare setup and google domain setup 
2018-04-06 16:52:31	gjabell	? 
2018-04-06 16:54:41	gjabell	actually I gotta go grab a package from tower, you want I can come over and help you set it up 
2018-04-06 16:54:58	jesse	sure! 
2018-04-06 16:55:23	gjabell	neato, I'll let you know when I'm outside 
2018-04-06 17:01:08	gjabell	Here 
2018-04-06 17:01:19	gjabell	Front doors 
2018-04-06 17:01:31	jesse	k 
2018-04-06 21:19:47	jesse	hey galen, I set up a matrix thingy 
2018-04-06 21:20:24	jesse	if ya wanna play around with it, you can just connect to 152.7.72.93:8008 
2018-04-06 21:21:14	jesse	I'm pretty sure it integrates well with other clients too so it doesn't need to be web-based. You could download an app on your phone. 
2018-04-06 21:33:08	gjabell	Neat 
2018-04-06 21:35:14	jesse	i guess I can't just do www.jessesimpsoncodes.com:8008. I think it's cuz jessesimpsoncodes.com maps to port 80 by default :P 
2018-04-06 21:36:28	gjabell	I think you could, you just have to specify the port or it will default to 80 
2018-04-06 21:36:54	gjabell	I'm guessing I need custom creds for the server? 
2018-04-06 21:37:16	jesse	my browser just hangs there. 
2018-04-06 21:37:25	jesse	uhh you should be able to create an account 
2018-04-06 21:37:37	gjabell	Ah 
2018-04-06 21:37:51	gjabell	It's disabled xD 
2018-04-06 21:38:04	jesse	Ill make one for you then lol 
2018-04-06 21:38:08	gjabell	Also I'm  guessing it's not SSL? 
2018-04-06 21:40:00	jesse	whutz dat 
2018-04-06 21:40:03	jesse	im jk. 
2018-04-06 21:40:24	jesse	I might be able to make it SSL. 
2018-04-06 21:40:27	gjabell	XD 
2018-04-06 21:40:27	jesse	if it isn't 
2018-04-06 21:40:42	gjabell	Just throw a let's encrypt cert on the server and you should be good 
2018-04-06 21:40:50	jesse	hold on, I got a EOFError 
2018-04-06 21:40:55	gjabell	It'll need to be for your domain tho, can't do it for an ip 
2018-04-06 21:41:26	jesse	ok. you are 'galen' with password 'ilovekittens' 
2018-04-06 21:41:44	jesse	the eof error was me being dumb 
2018-04-06 22:03:16	gjabell	Lol xD 
2018-04-06 22:05:15	gjabell	It worked :D 
2018-04-06 22:05:36	jesse	pssh. of course it did. 
2018-04-06 22:07:20	jesse	its gonna take a lot of work to import all of the emojis, gifs, crappy css, and surveillance code from facebook... 
2018-04-06 22:09:10	gjabell	Lol xD 
2018-04-06 22:10:18	jesse	but don't worry, the surveillance code will be end to end encrypted so that the facebook creators can have their privacy 
2018-04-06 22:50:21	jesse	I got it.

2018-04-07 10:15:57		getting channel history...
2018-04-04 21:01:41	jesse	['u', 'g'] 
2018-04-04 21:03:37	gjabell	So it says if there are groups in the pattern return a list of groups 
2018-04-04 21:03:40	gjabell	For findall 
2018-04-04 21:03:51	gjabell	Not sure if that's relevant for this case 
2018-04-04 21:06:51	gjabell	Are you trying to match the domain? 
2018-04-04 21:08:01	jesse	match the whole email address 
2018-04-04 21:08:25	gjabell	Why the capture group then? 
2018-04-04 21:08:45	jesse	group(0) gets the string that is from the whole regex 
2018-04-04 21:09:02	jesse	group(1) would just be the first part, so \w+ 
2018-04-04 21:09:12	gjabell	oh 
2018-04-04 21:09:38	gjabell	findall returns a list of groups 
2018-04-04 21:09:43	gjabell	so it's just returning the last group 
2018-04-04 21:09:48	gjabell	(\w\.?) 
2018-04-04 21:09:53	gjabell	which is the last letter 
2018-04-04 21:11:17	gjabell	are you trying to match emails in a large block of text? 
2018-04-04 21:11:40	jesse	yup 
2018-04-04 21:12:18	gjabell	how about re.findall('(\w+@\w+)') 
2018-04-04 21:13:00	gjabell	or maybe re.findall('(\w+@\w+\.\w+') 
2018-04-04 21:13:06	gjabell	so make sure it ends with something.something 
2018-04-04 21:15:25	jesse	I added the . in there to match my case.. I used '\w+@[\w\.]+' since there could be any number of periods.  
2018-04-04 21:15:52	gjabell	ah 
2018-04-04 21:16:14	jesse	it seems to work now. idk why it didn't work before though 
2018-04-04 21:16:25	gjabell	yea idk 
2018-04-04 21:16:37	jesse	maybe I should just avoid question marks 
2018-04-04 21:16:40	gjabell	I always have to lookup the regex docs for python lol 
2018-04-04 21:16:52	gjabell	were you trying to do optionals 
2018-04-04 21:16:53	gjabell	? 
2018-04-04 21:17:42	jesse	yeah, it was in my first regex I sent ya 
2018-04-04 21:17:56	gjabell	ah 
2018-04-04 21:18:07	gjabell	pretty sure ? inside group is 0 or 1 
2018-04-04 21:18:22	gjabell	if you want an optional capture group it's (?:stuff) 
2018-04-04 21:18:26	gjabell	I think 
2018-04-04 21:19:30	gjabell	wait nm 
2018-04-04 21:19:33	gjabell	that's non capturing 
2018-04-04 21:19:37	jesse	the zero or one is what I wanted. 
2018-04-04 21:19:41	gjabell	ok 
2018-04-04 21:33:52	jesse	regex sux. 
2018-04-04 21:34:06	gjabell	XD 
2018-04-04 21:34:07	jesse	its totally not me sucking at it 
2018-04-04 21:34:13	gjabell	Def not 
2018-04-04 21:34:24	jesse	cant be. Im extraordinary 
2018-04-04 21:34:35	gjabell	^ 
2018-04-04 21:34:45	gjabell	No ordinaries here 
2018-04-04 21:35:02	jesse	lol

2018-04-06 10:19:06	jesse	cool program ^ maybe my next raspberry pi project will use this. 
2018-04-06 10:20:01	gjabell	that's neat xD 
2018-04-06 10:20:07	gjabell	kinda want to try that now 
2018-04-06 10:22:42	jesse	sweet. Ive got homework to do, but if you do something cool, let me know haha 
2018-04-06 10:23:00	gjabell	I will haha, not sure if I'll get around to it today 
2018-04-06 10:24:17	jesse	lol okay. i might play with it tomorrow, but I'm pretty stacked on work so idk. 
2018-04-06 10:24:23	gjabell	yeah 
2018-04-06 10:28:57	jesse	btw, my research group found out that some web scraping tools in python by default ignore robots.txt ... which is really bad lol 
2018-04-06 10:29:03	gjabell	riip 
2018-04-06 15:24:32	jesse	I was looking into getting a domain name from google, and http://jessesimpson.com (jessesimpson.com) is taken :(  ... I'll need to find something like http://XxNinjaHackMasterButN0tRly23xX.org (XxNinjaHackMasterButN0tRly23xX.org) or something xD 
2018-04-06 15:24:49	gjabell	lol xD 
2018-04-06 15:25:01	jesse	it's gotta be more inconvenient than an ip address lol 
2018-04-06 15:25:16	gjabell	xD 
2018-04-06 15:25:21	gjabell	what's your middle initial 
2018-04-06 15:25:35	jesse	L 
2018-04-06 15:26:14	gjabell	hmm 
2018-04-06 15:26:20	gjabell	http://jlsimpson.com (jlsimpson.com) is taken 
2018-04-06 15:26:29	gjabell	http://jesselsimpson.com (jesselsimpson.com) isn't although it's a bit more confusing 
2018-04-06 15:26:37	gjabell	http://jls.com (jls.com) is too 
2018-04-06 15:26:47	gjabell	you could do http://jlscode.com (jlscode.com) 
2018-04-06 15:27:43	jesse	that one's not bad. 
2018-04-06 15:28:00	gjabell	http://jessesimpson.io (jessesimpson.io) is also but it's $60 a year 
2018-04-06 15:28:07	gjabell	which still isn't too bad but maybe not worth 
2018-04-06 15:28:16	jesse	well I do have http://jessesimpson36.github.io (jessesimpson36.github.io) xD 
2018-04-06 15:28:52	gjabell	http://jessesimpson36.com (jessesimpson36.com) is available xD 
2018-04-06 15:28:56	gjabell	why 36? 
2018-04-06 15:29:03	jesse	thats my github name 
2018-04-06 15:29:06	gjabell	ah 
2018-04-06 15:29:14	jesse	and my favorite number. 
2018-04-06 15:29:24	jesse	because it's my second favorite number squared... 
2018-04-06 15:29:28	gjabell	lol xD 
2018-04-06 15:29:39	gjabell	or maybe your second favorite number is your favorite number sqrted 
2018-04-06 15:29:48	gjabell	you could do http://jessesimps0n.com (jessesimps0n.com) lol 
2018-04-06 15:30:08	jesse	xD I'll just take the ip address if thats what im working with haha 
2018-04-06 15:30:18	gjabell	haha yeah 
2018-04-06 15:30:24	gjabell	probably less cringy lol 
2018-04-06 15:31:45	gjabell	you could do http://jessetheteadrinker.com (jessetheteadrinker.com) 
2018-04-06 15:31:51	gjabell	:P 
2018-04-06 15:32:39	jesse	lol  http://leeteaformea.com (leeteaformea.com) 
2018-04-06 15:33:01	jesse	cuz my middle name is lee 
2018-04-06 15:34:00	gjabell	why the a 
2018-04-06 15:34:32	jesse	cuz i wanted it to rhyme with tea ... and im stupid 
2018-04-06 15:34:49	gjabell	xD 
2018-04-06 15:34:57	gjabell	tee-uh 
2018-04-06 15:35:12	gjabell	you could get jessesimpson.codes for $50 a year 
2018-04-06 15:35:17	gjabell	that almost seems worth lol 
2018-04-06 15:35:42	gjabell	or go for a .me ending: http://leeteafor.me (leeteafor.me) 
2018-04-06 15:35:57	jesse	why is there an 's' on the end of code though?  
2018-04-06 15:35:58	gjabell	how about jessesimpson.coupons 
2018-04-06 15:36:01	jesse	xDDD 
2018-04-06 15:36:05	gjabell	idk, .code isn't available lol 
2018-04-06 15:36:16	gjabell	but I actually like the s, since you are coding 
2018-04-06 15:36:21	gjabell	hence, jesse simpson codes 
2018-04-06 15:37:17	jesse	yeah but 50$ a year makes me sad. that is a pretty good one though 
2018-04-06 15:37:28	gjabell	yeah that's the only downside 
2018-04-06 15:37:42	gjabell	you could do http://jessesimpsoncode.com (jessesimpsoncode.com) 
2018-04-06 15:37:52	gjabell	or http://jessesimpsoncodes.com (jessesimpsoncodes.com) 
2018-04-06 15:39:41	jesse	I might go with that one honestly. 
2018-04-06 15:39:51	gjabell	heck, just http://jessecode.com (jessecode.com) is available lol 
2018-04-06 15:40:07	gjabell	jessecodes isn't unf 
2018-04-06 15:40:34	gjabell	jessesimpson.computer is $30 a year xD 
2018-04-06 15:40:40	jesse	yeah I was checking jessecodes haha 
2018-04-06 15:42:21	jesse	http://jessehacks.com (jessehacks.com) is available. 
2018-04-06 15:42:50	gjabell	that's not bad 
2018-04-06 15:43:04	gjabell	although I'm not sure if that's necessarily a good one for business purposes haha 
2018-04-06 15:43:09	gjabell	people are ignorant :P 
2018-04-06 15:45:27	jesse	for the most part, I really just want it for screwing around with raspberry pi stuff. I don't really care about business purposes... but if they saw whatever i'm doing anyway, I guess it could be bad. 
2018-04-06 15:46:03	gjabell	that's fair, I'm thinking more if you end up hosting your website on it and are doing freelance work 
2018-04-06 15:46:15	gjabell	people are stupid, they might be less likely to hire someone if they think they are a 'hacker' 
2018-04-06 15:46:22	jesse	is that your goal for http://gjabell.com (gjabell.com)? 
2018-04-06 15:46:27	gjabell	I think the codes one would be better 
2018-04-06 15:46:40	gjabell	I have http://galenabell.com (galenabell.com), but yeah xD 
2018-04-06 15:46:50	gjabell	I need to get my website up again, just need to figure out what I want on it lol 
2018-04-06 15:47:12	gjabell	it's nice to have an actual domain tho bc you can do some neat stuff with subdomains 
2018-04-06 15:47:24	gjabell	so like http://git.galenabell.com (git.galenabell.com) goes to my gitlab, and http://plex.galenabell.com (plex.galenabell.com) goes to my plex 
2018-04-06 15:47:30	gjabell	I used to have others but they aren't up atm 
2018-04-06 15:50:49	jesse	Yeah. I'd like to be able to do something like that.  
2018-04-06 15:51:23	gjabell	i'd just get something you'd be comfortable using as your professional website domain 
2018-04-06 15:51:29	gjabell	and make subdomains off that 
2018-04-06 15:53:03	jesse	yeah. jessesimpsoncodes is good for that. maybe a little long but I guess it has to be since literally everything is taken lol 
2018-04-06 15:53:45	gjabell	haha yeah 
2018-04-06 15:53:54	gjabell	I think it's good tho bc it's pretty obvious what it is 
2018-04-06 15:54:09	gjabell	and it's easier to remember than some random 5 letter acronym or something lol 
2018-04-06 15:56:45	jesse	I agree. Thanks for the name galen!!! :P 
2018-04-06 15:57:23	gjabell	np :) 
2018-04-06 15:57:32	gjabell	let me know how it goes 
2018-04-06 16:33:21	jesse	you used cloudflare for ddns stuff right? 
2018-04-06 16:33:47	gjabell	yeah although you could also just use google's api if you got it through google domains 
2018-04-06 16:34:08	gjabell	I switched to cloudflare bc I couldn't get something to work with google's apis lol 
2018-04-06 16:36:10	jesse	meh. I trust your intuition. 
2018-04-06 16:36:22	gjabell	fair enough xD 
2018-04-06 16:36:34	gjabell	I like the idea of anti-ddos even though I doubt it will be an issue 
2018-04-06 16:36:38	gjabell	plus cloudflare also has a nice api 
2018-04-06 16:40:09	jesse	theres a lot of acronyms on the DNS part of the site  
2018-04-06 16:40:34	gjabell	lol yeah xD 
2018-04-06 16:40:38	gjabell	for cloudflare you mean? 
2018-04-06 16:41:23	jesse	yep 
2018-04-06 16:41:45	jesse	A AAAA CNAME, etc. its kinda confusing to me. 
2018-04-06 16:41:58	gjabell	ah, yeah 
2018-04-06 16:42:22	gjabell	so an 'A' record is basically a pointer from a domain name to an IP address 
2018-04-06 16:42:42	gjabell	ie http://galenabell.com (galenabell.com) -> 152.... yadda yadda 
2018-04-06 16:42:53	gjabell	AAAA records are the same as A records but for IPv6 
2018-04-06 16:43:04	gjabell	CNAME is an alias 
2018-04-06 16:43:16	gjabell	so on mine I have an A record from http://galenabell.com (galenabell.com) to my IP 
2018-04-06 16:43:24	gjabell	and I have a CNAME record from * to http://galenabell.com (galenabell.com) 
2018-04-06 16:43:53	gjabell	which basically says, if anyone goes to *.http://galenabell.com (galenabell.com) (any subdomain), direct them instead to http://galenabell.com (galenabell.com) (or whatever the IP it points at is) 
2018-04-06 16:44:13	gjabell	and I have another one from www to http://galenabell.com (galenabell.com), so http://www.galenabell.com (www.galenabell.com) and just http://galenabell.com (galenabell.com) go to the same thing 
2018-04-06 16:44:41	gjabell	MX records are for mail servers, so you don't need to worry about those unless you are doing mail stuff (or have a website gmail account, etc) 
2018-04-06 16:45:12	gjabell	TXT records are basically just plaintext things you can stick onto domains, thye don't actually do anything for DNS lookup but you can use them for metadata and the like 
2018-04-06 16:45:34	gjabell	NS records are for specifying which DNS provider has the domain records 
2018-04-06 16:45:56	jesse	gootttchhhaaaa.. 
2018-04-06 16:46:02	gjabell	I haven't used any of the others tbh, but I imagine they have some use 
2018-04-06 16:46:33	gjabell	I can send you a screenshot of my cloudflare setup real quick 
2018-04-06 16:47:27	gjabell	@gjabell uploaded a file: https://sturgill-operators.slack.com/files/U5AUU7HHA/FA2NNLGHG/2018-04-06-164647_987x925_scrot.png (2018-04-06-164647 987x925 scrot) 
2018-04-06 16:47:41	gjabell	there's a bunch of extra stuff on there bc of the MX records 
2018-04-06 16:47:47	gjabell	but the top ones should give a bit of an idea 
2018-04-06 16:52:08	jesse	yeah it just doesn't seem to be working right. going to the domain name doesn't pull up the website im hosting. 
2018-04-06 16:52:30	gjabell	can you SS your cloudflare setup and google domain setup 
2018-04-06 16:52:31	gjabell	? 
2018-04-06 16:54:41	gjabell	actually I gotta go grab a package from tower, you want I can come over and help you set it up 
2018-04-06 16:54:58	jesse	sure! 
2018-04-06 16:55:23	gjabell	neato, I'll let you know when I'm outside 
2018-04-06 17:01:08	gjabell	Here 
2018-04-06 17:01:19	gjabell	Front doors 
2018-04-06 17:01:31	jesse	k 
2018-04-06 21:19:47	jesse	hey galen, I set up a matrix thingy 
2018-04-06 21:20:24	jesse	if ya wanna play around with it, you can just connect to 152.7.72.93:8008 
2018-04-06 21:21:14	jesse	I'm pretty sure it integrates well with other clients too so it doesn't need to be web-based. You could download an app on your phone. 
2018-04-06 21:33:08	gjabell	Neat 
2018-04-06 21:35:14	jesse	i guess I can't just do http://www.jessesimpsoncodes.com:8008 (www.jessesimpsoncodes.com:8008). I think it's cuz http://jessesimpsoncodes.com (jessesimpsoncodes.com) maps to port 80 by default :P 
2018-04-06 21:36:28	gjabell	I think you could, you just have to specify the port or it will default to 80 
2018-04-06 21:36:54	gjabell	I'm guessing I need custom creds for the server? 
2018-04-06 21:37:16	jesse	my browser just hangs there. 
2018-04-06 21:37:25	jesse	uhh you should be able to create an account 
2018-04-06 21:37:37	gjabell	Ah 
2018-04-06 21:37:51	gjabell	It's disabled xD 
2018-04-06 21:38:04	jesse	Ill make one for you then lol 
2018-04-06 21:38:08	gjabell	Also I'm  guessing it's not SSL? 
2018-04-06 21:40:00	jesse	whutz dat 
2018-04-06 21:40:03	jesse	im jk. 
2018-04-06 21:40:24	jesse	I might be able to make it SSL. 
2018-04-06 21:40:27	gjabell	XD 
2018-04-06 21:40:27	jesse	if it isn't 
2018-04-06 21:40:42	gjabell	Just throw a let's encrypt cert on the server and you should be good 
2018-04-06 21:40:50	jesse	hold on, I got a EOFError 
2018-04-06 21:40:55	gjabell	It'll need to be for your domain tho, can't do it for an ip 
2018-04-06 21:41:26	jesse	ok. you are 'galen' with password 'ilovekittens' 
2018-04-06 21:41:44	jesse	the eof error was me being dumb 
2018-04-06 22:03:16	gjabell	Lol xD 
2018-04-06 22:05:15	gjabell	It worked :D 
2018-04-06 22:05:36	jesse	pssh. of course it did. 
2018-04-06 22:07:20	jesse	its gonna take a lot of work to import all of the emojis, gifs, crappy css, and surveillance code from facebook... 
2018-04-06 22:09:10	gjabell	Lol xD 
2018-04-06 22:10:18	jesse	but don't worry, the surveillance code will be end to end encrypted so that the facebook creators can have their privacy 
2018-04-06 22:50:21	jesse	I got it. 
2018-04-07 10:19:00	jesse	do you run python programs directly in vim? 
2018-04-07 10:24:18	gjabell	No but I probably should xD 
2018-04-07 10:25:13	jesse	I remember seeing something in your vimrc that seems to indicate that you do lol. And I was thinking about our buffer problem haha 
2018-04-07 10:25:23	jesse	in i3/vim/tmux 
2018-04-07 10:40:08	gjabell	Lol yea 
2018-04-07 10:40:12	gjabell	Probably in there somewhere 
2018-04-07 16:55:32		getting channel history...
2018-04-04 21:09:02	jesse	group(1) would just be the first part, so \w+ 
2018-04-04 21:09:12	gjabell	oh 
2018-04-04 21:09:38	gjabell	findall returns a list of groups 
2018-04-04 21:09:43	gjabell	so it's just returning the last group 
2018-04-04 21:09:48	gjabell	(\w\.?) 
2018-04-04 21:09:53	gjabell	which is the last letter 
2018-04-04 21:11:17	gjabell	are you trying to match emails in a large block of text? 
2018-04-04 21:11:40	jesse	yup 
2018-04-04 21:12:18	gjabell	how about re.findall('(\w+@\w+)') 
2018-04-04 21:13:00	gjabell	or maybe re.findall('(\w+@\w+\.\w+') 
2018-04-04 21:13:06	gjabell	so make sure it ends with something.something 
2018-04-04 21:15:25	jesse	I added the . in there to match my case.. I used '\w+@[\w\.]+' since there could be any number of periods.  
2018-04-04 21:15:52	gjabell	ah 
2018-04-04 21:16:14	jesse	it seems to work now. idk why it didn't work before though 
2018-04-04 21:16:25	gjabell	yea idk 
2018-04-04 21:16:37	jesse	maybe I should just avoid question marks 
2018-04-04 21:16:40	gjabell	I always have to lookup the regex docs for python lol 
2018-04-04 21:16:52	gjabell	were you trying to do optionals 
2018-04-04 21:16:53	gjabell	? 
2018-04-04 21:17:42	jesse	yeah, it was in my first regex I sent ya 
2018-04-04 21:17:56	gjabell	ah 
2018-04-04 21:18:07	gjabell	pretty sure ? inside group is 0 or 1 
2018-04-04 21:18:22	gjabell	if you want an optional capture group it's (?:stuff) 
2018-04-04 21:18:26	gjabell	I think 
2018-04-04 21:19:30	gjabell	wait nm 
2018-04-04 21:19:33	gjabell	that's non capturing 
2018-04-04 21:19:37	jesse	the zero or one is what I wanted. 
2018-04-04 21:19:41	gjabell	ok 
2018-04-04 21:33:52	jesse	regex sux. 
2018-04-04 21:34:06	gjabell	XD 
2018-04-04 21:34:07	jesse	its totally not me sucking at it 
2018-04-04 21:34:13	gjabell	Def not 
2018-04-04 21:34:24	jesse	cant be. Im extraordinary 
2018-04-04 21:34:35	gjabell	^ 
2018-04-04 21:34:45	gjabell	No ordinaries here 
2018-04-04 21:35:02	jesse	lol

2018-04-06 10:19:06	jesse	cool program ^ maybe my next raspberry pi project will use this. 
2018-04-06 10:20:01	gjabell	that's neat xD 
2018-04-06 10:20:07	gjabell	kinda want to try that now 
2018-04-06 10:22:42	jesse	sweet. Ive got homework to do, but if you do something cool, let me know haha 
2018-04-06 10:23:00	gjabell	I will haha, not sure if I'll get around to it today 
2018-04-06 10:24:17	jesse	lol okay. i might play with it tomorrow, but I'm pretty stacked on work so idk. 
2018-04-06 10:24:23	gjabell	yeah 
2018-04-06 10:28:57	jesse	btw, my research group found out that some web scraping tools in python by default ignore robots.txt ... which is really bad lol 
2018-04-06 10:29:03	gjabell	riip 
2018-04-06 15:24:32	jesse	I was looking into getting a domain name from google, and http://jessesimpson.com (jessesimpson.com) is taken :(  ... I'll need to find something like http://XxNinjaHackMasterButN0tRly23xX.org (XxNinjaHackMasterButN0tRly23xX.org) or something xD 
2018-04-06 15:24:49	gjabell	lol xD 
2018-04-06 15:25:01	jesse	it's gotta be more inconvenient than an ip address lol 
2018-04-06 15:25:16	gjabell	xD 
2018-04-06 15:25:21	gjabell	what's your middle initial 
2018-04-06 15:25:35	jesse	L 
2018-04-06 15:26:14	gjabell	hmm 
2018-04-06 15:26:20	gjabell	http://jlsimpson.com (jlsimpson.com) is taken 
2018-04-06 15:26:29	gjabell	http://jesselsimpson.com (jesselsimpson.com) isn't although it's a bit more confusing 
2018-04-06 15:26:37	gjabell	http://jls.com (jls.com) is too 
2018-04-06 15:26:47	gjabell	you could do http://jlscode.com (jlscode.com) 
2018-04-06 15:27:43	jesse	that one's not bad. 
2018-04-06 15:28:00	gjabell	http://jessesimpson.io (jessesimpson.io) is also but it's $60 a year 
2018-04-06 15:28:07	gjabell	which still isn't too bad but maybe not worth 
2018-04-06 15:28:16	jesse	well I do have http://jessesimpson36.github.io (jessesimpson36.github.io) xD 
2018-04-06 15:28:52	gjabell	http://jessesimpson36.com (jessesimpson36.com) is available xD 
2018-04-06 15:28:56	gjabell	why 36? 
2018-04-06 15:29:03	jesse	thats my github name 
2018-04-06 15:29:06	gjabell	ah 
2018-04-06 15:29:14	jesse	and my favorite number. 
2018-04-06 15:29:24	jesse	because it's my second favorite number squared... 
2018-04-06 15:29:28	gjabell	lol xD 
2018-04-06 15:29:39	gjabell	or maybe your second favorite number is your favorite number sqrted 
2018-04-06 15:29:48	gjabell	you could do http://jessesimps0n.com (jessesimps0n.com) lol 
2018-04-06 15:30:08	jesse	xD I'll just take the ip address if thats what im working with haha 
2018-04-06 15:30:18	gjabell	haha yeah 
2018-04-06 15:30:24	gjabell	probably less cringy lol 
2018-04-06 15:31:45	gjabell	you could do http://jessetheteadrinker.com (jessetheteadrinker.com) 
2018-04-06 15:31:51	gjabell	:P 
2018-04-06 15:32:39	jesse	lol  http://leeteaformea.com (leeteaformea.com) 
2018-04-06 15:33:01	jesse	cuz my middle name is lee 
2018-04-06 15:34:00	gjabell	why the a 
2018-04-06 15:34:32	jesse	cuz i wanted it to rhyme with tea ... and im stupid 
2018-04-06 15:34:49	gjabell	xD 
2018-04-06 15:34:57	gjabell	tee-uh 
2018-04-06 15:35:12	gjabell	you could get jessesimpson.codes for $50 a year 
2018-04-06 15:35:17	gjabell	that almost seems worth lol 
2018-04-06 15:35:42	gjabell	or go for a .me ending: http://leeteafor.me (leeteafor.me) 
2018-04-06 15:35:57	jesse	why is there an 's' on the end of code though?  
2018-04-06 15:35:58	gjabell	how about jessesimpson.coupons 
2018-04-06 15:36:01	jesse	xDDD 
2018-04-06 15:36:05	gjabell	idk, .code isn't available lol 
2018-04-06 15:36:16	gjabell	but I actually like the s, since you are coding 
2018-04-06 15:36:21	gjabell	hence, jesse simpson codes 
2018-04-06 15:37:17	jesse	yeah but 50$ a year makes me sad. that is a pretty good one though 
2018-04-06 15:37:28	gjabell	yeah that's the only downside 
2018-04-06 15:37:42	gjabell	you could do http://jessesimpsoncode.com (jessesimpsoncode.com) 
2018-04-06 15:37:52	gjabell	or http://jessesimpsoncodes.com (jessesimpsoncodes.com) 
2018-04-06 15:39:41	jesse	I might go with that one honestly. 
2018-04-06 15:39:51	gjabell	heck, just http://jessecode.com (jessecode.com) is available lol 
2018-04-06 15:40:07	gjabell	jessecodes isn't unf 
2018-04-06 15:40:34	gjabell	jessesimpson.computer is $30 a year xD 
2018-04-06 15:40:40	jesse	yeah I was checking jessecodes haha 
2018-04-06 15:42:21	jesse	http://jessehacks.com (jessehacks.com) is available. 
2018-04-06 15:42:50	gjabell	that's not bad 
2018-04-06 15:43:04	gjabell	although I'm not sure if that's necessarily a good one for business purposes haha 
2018-04-06 15:43:09	gjabell	people are ignorant :P 
2018-04-06 15:45:27	jesse	for the most part, I really just want it for screwing around with raspberry pi stuff. I don't really care about business purposes... but if they saw whatever i'm doing anyway, I guess it could be bad. 
2018-04-06 15:46:03	gjabell	that's fair, I'm thinking more if you end up hosting your website on it and are doing freelance work 
2018-04-06 15:46:15	gjabell	people are stupid, they might be less likely to hire someone if they think they are a 'hacker' 
2018-04-06 15:46:22	jesse	is that your goal for http://gjabell.com (gjabell.com)? 
2018-04-06 15:46:27	gjabell	I think the codes one would be better 
2018-04-06 15:46:40	gjabell	I have http://galenabell.com (galenabell.com), but yeah xD 
2018-04-06 15:46:50	gjabell	I need to get my website up again, just need to figure out what I want on it lol 
2018-04-06 15:47:12	gjabell	it's nice to have an actual domain tho bc you can do some neat stuff with subdomains 
2018-04-06 15:47:24	gjabell	so like http://git.galenabell.com (git.galenabell.com) goes to my gitlab, and http://plex.galenabell.com (plex.galenabell.com) goes to my plex 
2018-04-06 15:47:30	gjabell	I used to have others but they aren't up atm 
2018-04-06 15:50:49	jesse	Yeah. I'd like to be able to do something like that.  
2018-04-06 15:51:23	gjabell	i'd just get something you'd be comfortable using as your professional website domain 
2018-04-06 15:51:29	gjabell	and make subdomains off that 
2018-04-06 15:53:03	jesse	yeah. jessesimpsoncodes is good for that. maybe a little long but I guess it has to be since literally everything is taken lol 
2018-04-06 15:53:45	gjabell	haha yeah 
2018-04-06 15:53:54	gjabell	I think it's good tho bc it's pretty obvious what it is 
2018-04-06 15:54:09	gjabell	and it's easier to remember than some random 5 letter acronym or something lol 
2018-04-06 15:56:45	jesse	I agree. Thanks for the name galen!!! :P 
2018-04-06 15:57:23	gjabell	np :) 
2018-04-06 15:57:32	gjabell	let me know how it goes 
2018-04-06 16:33:21	jesse	you used cloudflare for ddns stuff right? 
2018-04-06 16:33:47	gjabell	yeah although you could also just use google's api if you got it through google domains 
2018-04-06 16:34:08	gjabell	I switched to cloudflare bc I couldn't get something to work with google's apis lol 
2018-04-06 16:36:10	jesse	meh. I trust your intuition. 
2018-04-06 16:36:22	gjabell	fair enough xD 
2018-04-06 16:36:34	gjabell	I like the idea of anti-ddos even though I doubt it will be an issue 
2018-04-06 16:36:38	gjabell	plus cloudflare also has a nice api 
2018-04-06 16:40:09	jesse	theres a lot of acronyms on the DNS part of the site  
2018-04-06 16:40:34	gjabell	lol yeah xD 
2018-04-06 16:40:38	gjabell	for cloudflare you mean? 
2018-04-06 16:41:23	jesse	yep 
2018-04-06 16:41:45	jesse	A AAAA CNAME, etc. its kinda confusing to me. 
2018-04-06 16:41:58	gjabell	ah, yeah 
2018-04-06 16:42:22	gjabell	so an 'A' record is basically a pointer from a domain name to an IP address 
2018-04-06 16:42:42	gjabell	ie http://galenabell.com (galenabell.com) -> 152.... yadda yadda 
2018-04-06 16:42:53	gjabell	AAAA records are the same as A records but for IPv6 
2018-04-06 16:43:04	gjabell	CNAME is an alias 
2018-04-06 16:43:16	gjabell	so on mine I have an A record from http://galenabell.com (galenabell.com) to my IP 
2018-04-06 16:43:24	gjabell	and I have a CNAME record from * to http://galenabell.com (galenabell.com) 
2018-04-06 16:43:53	gjabell	which basically says, if anyone goes to *.http://galenabell.com (galenabell.com) (any subdomain), direct them instead to http://galenabell.com (galenabell.com) (or whatever the IP it points at is) 
2018-04-06 16:44:13	gjabell	and I have another one from www to http://galenabell.com (galenabell.com), so http://www.galenabell.com (www.galenabell.com) and just http://galenabell.com (galenabell.com) go to the same thing 
2018-04-06 16:44:41	gjabell	MX records are for mail servers, so you don't need to worry about those unless you are doing mail stuff (or have a website gmail account, etc) 
2018-04-06 16:45:12	gjabell	TXT records are basically just plaintext things you can stick onto domains, thye don't actually do anything for DNS lookup but you can use them for metadata and the like 
2018-04-06 16:45:34	gjabell	NS records are for specifying which DNS provider has the domain records 
2018-04-06 16:45:56	jesse	gootttchhhaaaa.. 
2018-04-06 16:46:02	gjabell	I haven't used any of the others tbh, but I imagine they have some use 
2018-04-06 16:46:33	gjabell	I can send you a screenshot of my cloudflare setup real quick 
2018-04-06 16:47:27	gjabell	@gjabell uploaded a file: https://sturgill-operators.slack.com/files/U5AUU7HHA/FA2NNLGHG/2018-04-06-164647_987x925_scrot.png (2018-04-06-164647 987x925 scrot) 
2018-04-06 16:47:41	gjabell	there's a bunch of extra stuff on there bc of the MX records 
2018-04-06 16:47:47	gjabell	but the top ones should give a bit of an idea 
2018-04-06 16:52:08	jesse	yeah it just doesn't seem to be working right. going to the domain name doesn't pull up the website im hosting. 
2018-04-06 16:52:30	gjabell	can you SS your cloudflare setup and google domain setup 
2018-04-06 16:52:31	gjabell	? 
2018-04-06 16:54:41	gjabell	actually I gotta go grab a package from tower, you want I can come over and help you set it up 
2018-04-06 16:54:58	jesse	sure! 
2018-04-06 16:55:23	gjabell	neato, I'll let you know when I'm outside 
2018-04-06 17:01:08	gjabell	Here 
2018-04-06 17:01:19	gjabell	Front doors 
2018-04-06 17:01:31	jesse	k 
2018-04-06 21:19:47	jesse	hey galen, I set up a matrix thingy 
2018-04-06 21:20:24	jesse	if ya wanna play around with it, you can just connect to 152.7.72.93:8008 
2018-04-06 21:21:14	jesse	I'm pretty sure it integrates well with other clients too so it doesn't need to be web-based. You could download an app on your phone. 
2018-04-06 21:33:08	gjabell	Neat 
2018-04-06 21:35:14	jesse	i guess I can't just do http://www.jessesimpsoncodes.com:8008 (www.jessesimpsoncodes.com:8008). I think it's cuz http://jessesimpsoncodes.com (jessesimpsoncodes.com) maps to port 80 by default :P 
2018-04-06 21:36:28	gjabell	I think you could, you just have to specify the port or it will default to 80 
2018-04-06 21:36:54	gjabell	I'm guessing I need custom creds for the server? 
2018-04-06 21:37:16	jesse	my browser just hangs there. 
2018-04-06 21:37:25	jesse	uhh you should be able to create an account 
2018-04-06 21:37:37	gjabell	Ah 
2018-04-06 21:37:51	gjabell	It's disabled xD 
2018-04-06 21:38:04	jesse	Ill make one for you then lol 
2018-04-06 21:38:08	gjabell	Also I'm  guessing it's not SSL? 
2018-04-06 21:40:00	jesse	whutz dat 
2018-04-06 21:40:03	jesse	im jk. 
2018-04-06 21:40:24	jesse	I might be able to make it SSL. 
2018-04-06 21:40:27	gjabell	XD 
2018-04-06 21:40:27	jesse	if it isn't 
2018-04-06 21:40:42	gjabell	Just throw a let's encrypt cert on the server and you should be good 
2018-04-06 21:40:50	jesse	hold on, I got a EOFError 
2018-04-06 21:40:55	gjabell	It'll need to be for your domain tho, can't do it for an ip 
2018-04-06 21:41:26	jesse	ok. you are 'galen' with password 'ilovekittens' 
2018-04-06 21:41:44	jesse	the eof error was me being dumb 
2018-04-06 22:03:16	gjabell	Lol xD 
2018-04-06 22:05:15	gjabell	It worked :D 
2018-04-06 22:05:36	jesse	pssh. of course it did. 
2018-04-06 22:07:20	jesse	its gonna take a lot of work to import all of the emojis, gifs, crappy css, and surveillance code from facebook... 
2018-04-06 22:09:10	gjabell	Lol xD 
2018-04-06 22:10:18	jesse	but don't worry, the surveillance code will be end to end encrypted so that the facebook creators can have their privacy 
2018-04-06 22:50:21	jesse	I got it. 
2018-04-07 10:19:00	jesse	do you run python programs directly in vim? 
2018-04-07 10:24:18	gjabell	No but I probably should xD 
2018-04-07 10:25:13	jesse	I remember seeing something in your vimrc that seems to indicate that you do lol. And I was thinking about our buffer problem haha 
2018-04-07 10:25:23	jesse	in i3/vim/tmux 
2018-04-07 10:40:08	gjabell	Lol yea 
2018-04-07 10:40:12	gjabell	Probably in there somewhere 
2018-04-07 13:22:45	gjabell	Lately I've been doing tmux split 70-30 vertically, with vim in the top half with nerdbar and tags, and a terminal in the bottom half for running shit 
2018-04-07 13:58:33	jesse	yeah that's what i do for when I'm coding minus the nerdbar/tags. ive played around a little bit with running python programs while in vim and its just weird. It closes out of the editting window, runs the program and opens the editting window back up... theres probably a better way to do that though 
2018-04-07 17:51:54	jesse	what group letter are you in for plm? 
2018-04-07 17:53:11	jesse	I'm trying to go through other people's code and see if I can improve anything about our card game 
2018-04-07 17:53:44	jesse	and I don't want to go through with some of the changes menzies suggested 
2018-04-07 19:52:12	jesse	honestly, your code is probably the easiest to read out of all the projects I went through. the fsm stuff is super hard to read and hard to debug. 
2018-04-07 19:55:16	jesse	the only complaints I have with your stuff would be anything that menzies recommended. (pretty much the o objects)  
2018-04-07 19:57:32	jesse	or things like the isA method... which again, seemed to be copied from menzies code...  
2018-04-07 19:59:06		getting channel history...
2018-04-04 21:13:06	gjabell	so make sure it ends with something.something 
2018-04-04 21:15:25	jesse	I added the . in there to match my case.. I used '\w+@[\w\.]+' since there could be any number of periods.  
2018-04-04 21:15:52	gjabell	ah 
2018-04-04 21:16:14	jesse	it seems to work now. idk why it didn't work before though 
2018-04-04 21:16:25	gjabell	yea idk 
2018-04-04 21:16:37	jesse	maybe I should just avoid question marks 
2018-04-04 21:16:40	gjabell	I always have to lookup the regex docs for python lol 
2018-04-04 21:16:52	gjabell	were you trying to do optionals 
2018-04-04 21:16:53	gjabell	? 
2018-04-04 21:17:42	jesse	yeah, it was in my first regex I sent ya 
2018-04-04 21:17:56	gjabell	ah 
2018-04-04 21:18:07	gjabell	pretty sure ? inside group is 0 or 1 
2018-04-04 21:18:22	gjabell	if you want an optional capture group it's (?:stuff) 
2018-04-04 21:18:26	gjabell	I think 
2018-04-04 21:19:30	gjabell	wait nm 
2018-04-04 21:19:33	gjabell	that's non capturing 
2018-04-04 21:19:37	jesse	the zero or one is what I wanted. 
2018-04-04 21:19:41	gjabell	ok 
2018-04-04 21:33:52	jesse	regex sux. 
2018-04-04 21:34:06	gjabell	XD 
2018-04-04 21:34:07	jesse	its totally not me sucking at it 
2018-04-04 21:34:13	gjabell	Def not 
2018-04-04 21:34:24	jesse	cant be. Im extraordinary 
2018-04-04 21:34:35	gjabell	^ 
2018-04-04 21:34:45	gjabell	No ordinaries here 
2018-04-04 21:35:02	jesse	lol

2018-04-06 10:19:06	jesse	cool program ^ maybe my next raspberry pi project will use this. 
2018-04-06 10:20:01	gjabell	that's neat xD 
2018-04-06 10:20:07	gjabell	kinda want to try that now 
2018-04-06 10:22:42	jesse	sweet. Ive got homework to do, but if you do something cool, let me know haha 
2018-04-06 10:23:00	gjabell	I will haha, not sure if I'll get around to it today 
2018-04-06 10:24:17	jesse	lol okay. i might play with it tomorrow, but I'm pretty stacked on work so idk. 
2018-04-06 10:24:23	gjabell	yeah 
2018-04-06 10:28:57	jesse	btw, my research group found out that some web scraping tools in python by default ignore robots.txt ... which is really bad lol 
2018-04-06 10:29:03	gjabell	riip 
2018-04-06 15:24:32	jesse	I was looking into getting a domain name from google, and http://jessesimpson.com (jessesimpson.com) is taken :(  ... I'll need to find something like http://XxNinjaHackMasterButN0tRly23xX.org (XxNinjaHackMasterButN0tRly23xX.org) or something xD 
2018-04-06 15:24:49	gjabell	lol xD 
2018-04-06 15:25:01	jesse	it's gotta be more inconvenient than an ip address lol 
2018-04-06 15:25:16	gjabell	xD 
2018-04-06 15:25:21	gjabell	what's your middle initial 
2018-04-06 15:25:35	jesse	L 
2018-04-06 15:26:14	gjabell	hmm 
2018-04-06 15:26:20	gjabell	http://jlsimpson.com (jlsimpson.com) is taken 
2018-04-06 15:26:29	gjabell	http://jesselsimpson.com (jesselsimpson.com) isn't although it's a bit more confusing 
2018-04-06 15:26:37	gjabell	http://jls.com (jls.com) is too 
2018-04-06 15:26:47	gjabell	you could do http://jlscode.com (jlscode.com) 
2018-04-06 15:27:43	jesse	that one's not bad. 
2018-04-06 15:28:00	gjabell	http://jessesimpson.io (jessesimpson.io) is also but it's $60 a year 
2018-04-06 15:28:07	gjabell	which still isn't too bad but maybe not worth 
2018-04-06 15:28:16	jesse	well I do have http://jessesimpson36.github.io (jessesimpson36.github.io) xD 
2018-04-06 15:28:52	gjabell	http://jessesimpson36.com (jessesimpson36.com) is available xD 
2018-04-06 15:28:56	gjabell	why 36? 
2018-04-06 15:29:03	jesse	thats my github name 
2018-04-06 15:29:06	gjabell	ah 
2018-04-06 15:29:14	jesse	and my favorite number. 
2018-04-06 15:29:24	jesse	because it's my second favorite number squared... 
2018-04-06 15:29:28	gjabell	lol xD 
2018-04-06 15:29:39	gjabell	or maybe your second favorite number is your favorite number sqrted 
2018-04-06 15:29:48	gjabell	you could do http://jessesimps0n.com (jessesimps0n.com) lol 
2018-04-06 15:30:08	jesse	xD I'll just take the ip address if thats what im working with haha 
2018-04-06 15:30:18	gjabell	haha yeah 
2018-04-06 15:30:24	gjabell	probably less cringy lol 
2018-04-06 15:31:45	gjabell	you could do http://jessetheteadrinker.com (jessetheteadrinker.com) 
2018-04-06 15:31:51	gjabell	:P 
2018-04-06 15:32:39	jesse	lol  http://leeteaformea.com (leeteaformea.com) 
2018-04-06 15:33:01	jesse	cuz my middle name is lee 
2018-04-06 15:34:00	gjabell	why the a 
2018-04-06 15:34:32	jesse	cuz i wanted it to rhyme with tea ... and im stupid 
2018-04-06 15:34:49	gjabell	xD 
2018-04-06 15:34:57	gjabell	tee-uh 
2018-04-06 15:35:12	gjabell	you could get jessesimpson.codes for $50 a year 
2018-04-06 15:35:17	gjabell	that almost seems worth lol 
2018-04-06 15:35:42	gjabell	or go for a .me ending: http://leeteafor.me (leeteafor.me) 
2018-04-06 15:35:57	jesse	why is there an 's' on the end of code though?  
2018-04-06 15:35:58	gjabell	how about jessesimpson.coupons 
2018-04-06 15:36:01	jesse	xDDD 
2018-04-06 15:36:05	gjabell	idk, .code isn't available lol 
2018-04-06 15:36:16	gjabell	but I actually like the s, since you are coding 
2018-04-06 15:36:21	gjabell	hence, jesse simpson codes 
2018-04-06 15:37:17	jesse	yeah but 50$ a year makes me sad. that is a pretty good one though 
2018-04-06 15:37:28	gjabell	yeah that's the only downside 
2018-04-06 15:37:42	gjabell	you could do http://jessesimpsoncode.com (jessesimpsoncode.com) 
2018-04-06 15:37:52	gjabell	or http://jessesimpsoncodes.com (jessesimpsoncodes.com) 
2018-04-06 15:39:41	jesse	I might go with that one honestly. 
2018-04-06 15:39:51	gjabell	heck, just http://jessecode.com (jessecode.com) is available lol 
2018-04-06 15:40:07	gjabell	jessecodes isn't unf 
2018-04-06 15:40:34	gjabell	jessesimpson.computer is $30 a year xD 
2018-04-06 15:40:40	jesse	yeah I was checking jessecodes haha 
2018-04-06 15:42:21	jesse	http://jessehacks.com (jessehacks.com) is available. 
2018-04-06 15:42:50	gjabell	that's not bad 
2018-04-06 15:43:04	gjabell	although I'm not sure if that's necessarily a good one for business purposes haha 
2018-04-06 15:43:09	gjabell	people are ignorant :P 
2018-04-06 15:45:27	jesse	for the most part, I really just want it for screwing around with raspberry pi stuff. I don't really care about business purposes... but if they saw whatever i'm doing anyway, I guess it could be bad. 
2018-04-06 15:46:03	gjabell	that's fair, I'm thinking more if you end up hosting your website on it and are doing freelance work 
2018-04-06 15:46:15	gjabell	people are stupid, they might be less likely to hire someone if they think they are a 'hacker' 
2018-04-06 15:46:22	jesse	is that your goal for http://gjabell.com (gjabell.com)? 
2018-04-06 15:46:27	gjabell	I think the codes one would be better 
2018-04-06 15:46:40	gjabell	I have http://galenabell.com (galenabell.com), but yeah xD 
2018-04-06 15:46:50	gjabell	I need to get my website up again, just need to figure out what I want on it lol 
2018-04-06 15:47:12	gjabell	it's nice to have an actual domain tho bc you can do some neat stuff with subdomains 
2018-04-06 15:47:24	gjabell	so like http://git.galenabell.com (git.galenabell.com) goes to my gitlab, and http://plex.galenabell.com (plex.galenabell.com) goes to my plex 
2018-04-06 15:47:30	gjabell	I used to have others but they aren't up atm 
2018-04-06 15:50:49	jesse	Yeah. I'd like to be able to do something like that.  
2018-04-06 15:51:23	gjabell	i'd just get something you'd be comfortable using as your professional website domain 
2018-04-06 15:51:29	gjabell	and make subdomains off that 
2018-04-06 15:53:03	jesse	yeah. jessesimpsoncodes is good for that. maybe a little long but I guess it has to be since literally everything is taken lol 
2018-04-06 15:53:45	gjabell	haha yeah 
2018-04-06 15:53:54	gjabell	I think it's good tho bc it's pretty obvious what it is 
2018-04-06 15:54:09	gjabell	and it's easier to remember than some random 5 letter acronym or something lol 
2018-04-06 15:56:45	jesse	I agree. Thanks for the name galen!!! :P 
2018-04-06 15:57:23	gjabell	np :) 
2018-04-06 15:57:32	gjabell	let me know how it goes 
2018-04-06 16:33:21	jesse	you used cloudflare for ddns stuff right? 
2018-04-06 16:33:47	gjabell	yeah although you could also just use google's api if you got it through google domains 
2018-04-06 16:34:08	gjabell	I switched to cloudflare bc I couldn't get something to work with google's apis lol 
2018-04-06 16:36:10	jesse	meh. I trust your intuition. 
2018-04-06 16:36:22	gjabell	fair enough xD 
2018-04-06 16:36:34	gjabell	I like the idea of anti-ddos even though I doubt it will be an issue 
2018-04-06 16:36:38	gjabell	plus cloudflare also has a nice api 
2018-04-06 16:40:09	jesse	theres a lot of acronyms on the DNS part of the site  
2018-04-06 16:40:34	gjabell	lol yeah xD 
2018-04-06 16:40:38	gjabell	for cloudflare you mean? 
2018-04-06 16:41:23	jesse	yep 
2018-04-06 16:41:45	jesse	A AAAA CNAME, etc. its kinda confusing to me. 
2018-04-06 16:41:58	gjabell	ah, yeah 
2018-04-06 16:42:22	gjabell	so an 'A' record is basically a pointer from a domain name to an IP address 
2018-04-06 16:42:42	gjabell	ie http://galenabell.com (galenabell.com) -> 152.... yadda yadda 
2018-04-06 16:42:53	gjabell	AAAA records are the same as A records but for IPv6 
2018-04-06 16:43:04	gjabell	CNAME is an alias 
2018-04-06 16:43:16	gjabell	so on mine I have an A record from http://galenabell.com (galenabell.com) to my IP 
2018-04-06 16:43:24	gjabell	and I have a CNAME record from * to http://galenabell.com (galenabell.com) 
2018-04-06 16:43:53	gjabell	which basically says, if anyone goes to *.http://galenabell.com (galenabell.com) (any subdomain), direct them instead to http://galenabell.com (galenabell.com) (or whatever the IP it points at is) 
2018-04-06 16:44:13	gjabell	and I have another one from www to http://galenabell.com (galenabell.com), so http://www.galenabell.com (www.galenabell.com) and just http://galenabell.com (galenabell.com) go to the same thing 
2018-04-06 16:44:41	gjabell	MX records are for mail servers, so you don't need to worry about those unless you are doing mail stuff (or have a website gmail account, etc) 
2018-04-06 16:45:12	gjabell	TXT records are basically just plaintext things you can stick onto domains, thye don't actually do anything for DNS lookup but you can use them for metadata and the like 
2018-04-06 16:45:34	gjabell	NS records are for specifying which DNS provider has the domain records 
2018-04-06 16:45:56	jesse	gootttchhhaaaa.. 
2018-04-06 16:46:02	gjabell	I haven't used any of the others tbh, but I imagine they have some use 
2018-04-06 16:46:33	gjabell	I can send you a screenshot of my cloudflare setup real quick 
2018-04-06 16:47:27	gjabell	@gjabell uploaded a file: https://sturgill-operators.slack.com/files/U5AUU7HHA/FA2NNLGHG/2018-04-06-164647_987x925_scrot.png (2018-04-06-164647 987x925 scrot) 
2018-04-06 16:47:41	gjabell	there's a bunch of extra stuff on there bc of the MX records 
2018-04-06 16:47:47	gjabell	but the top ones should give a bit of an idea 
2018-04-06 16:52:08	jesse	yeah it just doesn't seem to be working right. going to the domain name doesn't pull up the website im hosting. 
2018-04-06 16:52:30	gjabell	can you SS your cloudflare setup and google domain setup 
2018-04-06 16:52:31	gjabell	? 
2018-04-06 16:54:41	gjabell	actually I gotta go grab a package from tower, you want I can come over and help you set it up 
2018-04-06 16:54:58	jesse	sure! 
2018-04-06 16:55:23	gjabell	neato, I'll let you know when I'm outside 
2018-04-06 17:01:08	gjabell	Here 
2018-04-06 17:01:19	gjabell	Front doors 
2018-04-06 17:01:31	jesse	k 
2018-04-06 21:19:47	jesse	hey galen, I set up a matrix thingy 
2018-04-06 21:20:24	jesse	if ya wanna play around with it, you can just connect to 152.7.72.93:8008 
2018-04-06 21:21:14	jesse	I'm pretty sure it integrates well with other clients too so it doesn't need to be web-based. You could download an app on your phone. 
2018-04-06 21:33:08	gjabell	Neat 
2018-04-06 21:35:14	jesse	i guess I can't just do http://www.jessesimpsoncodes.com:8008 (www.jessesimpsoncodes.com:8008). I think it's cuz http://jessesimpsoncodes.com (jessesimpsoncodes.com) maps to port 80 by default :P 
2018-04-06 21:36:28	gjabell	I think you could, you just have to specify the port or it will default to 80 
2018-04-06 21:36:54	gjabell	I'm guessing I need custom creds for the server? 
2018-04-06 21:37:16	jesse	my browser just hangs there. 
2018-04-06 21:37:25	jesse	uhh you should be able to create an account 
2018-04-06 21:37:37	gjabell	Ah 
2018-04-06 21:37:51	gjabell	It's disabled xD 
2018-04-06 21:38:04	jesse	Ill make one for you then lol 
2018-04-06 21:38:08	gjabell	Also I'm  guessing it's not SSL? 
2018-04-06 21:40:00	jesse	whutz dat 
2018-04-06 21:40:03	jesse	im jk. 
2018-04-06 21:40:24	jesse	I might be able to make it SSL. 
2018-04-06 21:40:27	gjabell	XD 
2018-04-06 21:40:27	jesse	if it isn't 
2018-04-06 21:40:42	gjabell	Just throw a let's encrypt cert on the server and you should be good 
2018-04-06 21:40:50	jesse	hold on, I got a EOFError 
2018-04-06 21:40:55	gjabell	It'll need to be for your domain tho, can't do it for an ip 
2018-04-06 21:41:26	jesse	ok. you are 'galen' with password 'ilovekittens' 
2018-04-06 21:41:44	jesse	the eof error was me being dumb 
2018-04-06 22:03:16	gjabell	Lol xD 
2018-04-06 22:05:15	gjabell	It worked :D 
2018-04-06 22:05:36	jesse	pssh. of course it did. 
2018-04-06 22:07:20	jesse	its gonna take a lot of work to import all of the emojis, gifs, crappy css, and surveillance code from facebook... 
2018-04-06 22:09:10	gjabell	Lol xD 
2018-04-06 22:10:18	jesse	but don't worry, the surveillance code will be end to end encrypted so that the facebook creators can have their privacy 
2018-04-06 22:50:21	jesse	I got it. 
2018-04-07 10:19:00	jesse	do you run python programs directly in vim? 
2018-04-07 10:24:18	gjabell	No but I probably should xD 
2018-04-07 10:25:13	jesse	I remember seeing something in your vimrc that seems to indicate that you do lol. And I was thinking about our buffer problem haha 
2018-04-07 10:25:23	jesse	in i3/vim/tmux 
2018-04-07 10:40:08	gjabell	Lol yea 
2018-04-07 10:40:12	gjabell	Probably in there somewhere 
2018-04-07 13:22:45	gjabell	Lately I've been doing tmux split 70-30 vertically, with vim in the top half with nerdbar and tags, and a terminal in the bottom half for running shit 
2018-04-07 13:58:33	jesse	yeah that's what i do for when I'm coding minus the nerdbar/tags. ive played around a little bit with running python programs while in vim and its just weird. It closes out of the editting window, runs the program and opens the editting window back up... theres probably a better way to do that though 
2018-04-07 17:51:54	jesse	what group letter are you in for plm? 
2018-04-07 17:53:11	jesse	I'm trying to go through other people's code and see if I can improve anything about our card game 
2018-04-07 17:53:44	jesse	and I don't want to go through with some of the changes menzies suggested 
2018-04-07 18:56:15	gjabell	A 
2018-04-07 18:56:22	gjabell	It's bad lol 
2018-04-07 18:57:20	jesse	lol the other teams that ive seen didnt look too special so im sure you guys are fine. 
2018-04-07 19:13:59	gjabell	XD hopefully 
2018-04-07 19:52:12	jesse	honestly, your code is probably the easiest to read out of all the projects I went through. the fsm stuff is super hard to read and hard to debug. 
2018-04-07 19:55:16	jesse	the only complaints I have with your stuff would be anything that menzies recommended. (pretty much the o objects)  
2018-04-07 19:57:32	jesse	or things like the isA method... which again, seemed to be copied from menzies code...  
2018-04-07 20:02:07		getting channel history...
2018-04-04 21:15:25	jesse	I added the . in there to match my case.. I used '\w+@[\w\.]+' since there could be any number of periods.  
2018-04-04 21:15:52	gjabell	ah 
2018-04-04 21:16:14	jesse	it seems to work now. idk why it didn't work before though 
2018-04-04 21:16:25	gjabell	yea idk 
2018-04-04 21:16:37	jesse	maybe I should just avoid question marks 
2018-04-04 21:16:40	gjabell	I always have to lookup the regex docs for python lol 
2018-04-04 21:16:52	gjabell	were you trying to do optionals 
2018-04-04 21:16:53	gjabell	? 
2018-04-04 21:17:42	jesse	yeah, it was in my first regex I sent ya 
2018-04-04 21:17:56	gjabell	ah 
2018-04-04 21:18:07	gjabell	pretty sure ? inside group is 0 or 1 
2018-04-04 21:18:22	gjabell	if you want an optional capture group it's (?:stuff) 
2018-04-04 21:18:26	gjabell	I think 
2018-04-04 21:19:30	gjabell	wait nm 
2018-04-04 21:19:33	gjabell	that's non capturing 
2018-04-04 21:19:37	jesse	the zero or one is what I wanted. 
2018-04-04 21:19:41	gjabell	ok 
2018-04-04 21:33:52	jesse	regex sux. 
2018-04-04 21:34:06	gjabell	XD 
2018-04-04 21:34:07	jesse	its totally not me sucking at it 
2018-04-04 21:34:13	gjabell	Def not 
2018-04-04 21:34:24	jesse	cant be. Im extraordinary 
2018-04-04 21:34:35	gjabell	^ 
2018-04-04 21:34:45	gjabell	No ordinaries here 
2018-04-04 21:35:02	jesse	lol

2018-04-06 10:19:06	jesse	cool program ^ maybe my next raspberry pi project will use this. 
2018-04-06 10:20:01	gjabell	that's neat xD 
2018-04-06 10:20:07	gjabell	kinda want to try that now 
2018-04-06 10:22:42	jesse	sweet. Ive got homework to do, but if you do something cool, let me know haha 
2018-04-06 10:23:00	gjabell	I will haha, not sure if I'll get around to it today 
2018-04-06 10:24:17	jesse	lol okay. i might play with it tomorrow, but I'm pretty stacked on work so idk. 
2018-04-06 10:24:23	gjabell	yeah 
2018-04-06 10:28:57	jesse	btw, my research group found out that some web scraping tools in python by default ignore robots.txt ... which is really bad lol 
2018-04-06 10:29:03	gjabell	riip 
2018-04-06 15:24:32	jesse	I was looking into getting a domain name from google, and http://jessesimpson.com (jessesimpson.com) is taken :(  ... I'll need to find something like http://XxNinjaHackMasterButN0tRly23xX.org (XxNinjaHackMasterButN0tRly23xX.org) or something xD 
2018-04-06 15:24:49	gjabell	lol xD 
2018-04-06 15:25:01	jesse	it's gotta be more inconvenient than an ip address lol 
2018-04-06 15:25:16	gjabell	xD 
2018-04-06 15:25:21	gjabell	what's your middle initial 
2018-04-06 15:25:35	jesse	L 
2018-04-06 15:26:14	gjabell	hmm 
2018-04-06 15:26:20	gjabell	http://jlsimpson.com (jlsimpson.com) is taken 
2018-04-06 15:26:29	gjabell	http://jesselsimpson.com (jesselsimpson.com) isn't although it's a bit more confusing 
2018-04-06 15:26:37	gjabell	http://jls.com (jls.com) is too 
2018-04-06 15:26:47	gjabell	you could do http://jlscode.com (jlscode.com) 
2018-04-06 15:27:43	jesse	that one's not bad. 
2018-04-06 15:28:00	gjabell	http://jessesimpson.io (jessesimpson.io) is also but it's $60 a year 
2018-04-06 15:28:07	gjabell	which still isn't too bad but maybe not worth 
2018-04-06 15:28:16	jesse	well I do have http://jessesimpson36.github.io (jessesimpson36.github.io) xD 
2018-04-06 15:28:52	gjabell	http://jessesimpson36.com (jessesimpson36.com) is available xD 
2018-04-06 15:28:56	gjabell	why 36? 
2018-04-06 15:29:03	jesse	thats my github name 
2018-04-06 15:29:06	gjabell	ah 
2018-04-06 15:29:14	jesse	and my favorite number. 
2018-04-06 15:29:24	jesse	because it's my second favorite number squared... 
2018-04-06 15:29:28	gjabell	lol xD 
2018-04-06 15:29:39	gjabell	or maybe your second favorite number is your favorite number sqrted 
2018-04-06 15:29:48	gjabell	you could do http://jessesimps0n.com (jessesimps0n.com) lol 
2018-04-06 15:30:08	jesse	xD I'll just take the ip address if thats what im working with haha 
2018-04-06 15:30:18	gjabell	haha yeah 
2018-04-06 15:30:24	gjabell	probably less cringy lol 
2018-04-06 15:31:45	gjabell	you could do http://jessetheteadrinker.com (jessetheteadrinker.com) 
2018-04-06 15:31:51	gjabell	:P 
2018-04-06 15:32:39	jesse	lol  http://leeteaformea.com (leeteaformea.com) 
2018-04-06 15:33:01	jesse	cuz my middle name is lee 
2018-04-06 15:34:00	gjabell	why the a 
2018-04-06 15:34:32	jesse	cuz i wanted it to rhyme with tea ... and im stupid 
2018-04-06 15:34:49	gjabell	xD 
2018-04-06 15:34:57	gjabell	tee-uh 
2018-04-06 15:35:12	gjabell	you could get jessesimpson.codes for $50 a year 
2018-04-06 15:35:17	gjabell	that almost seems worth lol 
2018-04-06 15:35:42	gjabell	or go for a .me ending: http://leeteafor.me (leeteafor.me) 
2018-04-06 15:35:57	jesse	why is there an 's' on the end of code though?  
2018-04-06 15:35:58	gjabell	how about jessesimpson.coupons 
2018-04-06 15:36:01	jesse	xDDD 
2018-04-06 15:36:05	gjabell	idk, .code isn't available lol 
2018-04-06 15:36:16	gjabell	but I actually like the s, since you are coding 
2018-04-06 15:36:21	gjabell	hence, jesse simpson codes 
2018-04-06 15:37:17	jesse	yeah but 50$ a year makes me sad. that is a pretty good one though 
2018-04-06 15:37:28	gjabell	yeah that's the only downside 
2018-04-06 15:37:42	gjabell	you could do http://jessesimpsoncode.com (jessesimpsoncode.com) 
2018-04-06 15:37:52	gjabell	or http://jessesimpsoncodes.com (jessesimpsoncodes.com) 
2018-04-06 15:39:41	jesse	I might go with that one honestly. 
2018-04-06 15:39:51	gjabell	heck, just http://jessecode.com (jessecode.com) is available lol 
2018-04-06 15:40:07	gjabell	jessecodes isn't unf 
2018-04-06 15:40:34	gjabell	jessesimpson.computer is $30 a year xD 
2018-04-06 15:40:40	jesse	yeah I was checking jessecodes haha 
2018-04-06 15:42:21	jesse	http://jessehacks.com (jessehacks.com) is available. 
2018-04-06 15:42:50	gjabell	that's not bad 
2018-04-06 15:43:04	gjabell	although I'm not sure if that's necessarily a good one for business purposes haha 
2018-04-06 15:43:09	gjabell	people are ignorant :P 
2018-04-06 15:45:27	jesse	for the most part, I really just want it for screwing around with raspberry pi stuff. I don't really care about business purposes... but if they saw whatever i'm doing anyway, I guess it could be bad. 
2018-04-06 15:46:03	gjabell	that's fair, I'm thinking more if you end up hosting your website on it and are doing freelance work 
2018-04-06 15:46:15	gjabell	people are stupid, they might be less likely to hire someone if they think they are a 'hacker' 
2018-04-06 15:46:22	jesse	is that your goal for http://gjabell.com (gjabell.com)? 
2018-04-06 15:46:27	gjabell	I think the codes one would be better 
2018-04-06 15:46:40	gjabell	I have http://galenabell.com (galenabell.com), but yeah xD 
2018-04-06 15:46:50	gjabell	I need to get my website up again, just need to figure out what I want on it lol 
2018-04-06 15:47:12	gjabell	it's nice to have an actual domain tho bc you can do some neat stuff with subdomains 
2018-04-06 15:47:24	gjabell	so like http://git.galenabell.com (git.galenabell.com) goes to my gitlab, and http://plex.galenabell.com (plex.galenabell.com) goes to my plex 
2018-04-06 15:47:30	gjabell	I used to have others but they aren't up atm 
2018-04-06 15:50:49	jesse	Yeah. I'd like to be able to do something like that.  
2018-04-06 15:51:23	gjabell	i'd just get something you'd be comfortable using as your professional website domain 
2018-04-06 15:51:29	gjabell	and make subdomains off that 
2018-04-06 15:53:03	jesse	yeah. jessesimpsoncodes is good for that. maybe a little long but I guess it has to be since literally everything is taken lol 
2018-04-06 15:53:45	gjabell	haha yeah 
2018-04-06 15:53:54	gjabell	I think it's good tho bc it's pretty obvious what it is 
2018-04-06 15:54:09	gjabell	and it's easier to remember than some random 5 letter acronym or something lol 
2018-04-06 15:56:45	jesse	I agree. Thanks for the name galen!!! :P 
2018-04-06 15:57:23	gjabell	np :) 
2018-04-06 15:57:32	gjabell	let me know how it goes 
2018-04-06 16:33:21	jesse	you used cloudflare for ddns stuff right? 
2018-04-06 16:33:47	gjabell	yeah although you could also just use google's api if you got it through google domains 
2018-04-06 16:34:08	gjabell	I switched to cloudflare bc I couldn't get something to work with google's apis lol 
2018-04-06 16:36:10	jesse	meh. I trust your intuition. 
2018-04-06 16:36:22	gjabell	fair enough xD 
2018-04-06 16:36:34	gjabell	I like the idea of anti-ddos even though I doubt it will be an issue 
2018-04-06 16:36:38	gjabell	plus cloudflare also has a nice api 
2018-04-06 16:40:09	jesse	theres a lot of acronyms on the DNS part of the site  
2018-04-06 16:40:34	gjabell	lol yeah xD 
2018-04-06 16:40:38	gjabell	for cloudflare you mean? 
2018-04-06 16:41:23	jesse	yep 
2018-04-06 16:41:45	jesse	A AAAA CNAME, etc. its kinda confusing to me. 
2018-04-06 16:41:58	gjabell	ah, yeah 
2018-04-06 16:42:22	gjabell	so an 'A' record is basically a pointer from a domain name to an IP address 
2018-04-06 16:42:42	gjabell	ie http://galenabell.com (galenabell.com) -> 152.... yadda yadda 
2018-04-06 16:42:53	gjabell	AAAA records are the same as A records but for IPv6 
2018-04-06 16:43:04	gjabell	CNAME is an alias 
2018-04-06 16:43:16	gjabell	so on mine I have an A record from http://galenabell.com (galenabell.com) to my IP 
2018-04-06 16:43:24	gjabell	and I have a CNAME record from * to http://galenabell.com (galenabell.com) 
2018-04-06 16:43:53	gjabell	which basically says, if anyone goes to *.http://galenabell.com (galenabell.com) (any subdomain), direct them instead to http://galenabell.com (galenabell.com) (or whatever the IP it points at is) 
2018-04-06 16:44:13	gjabell	and I have another one from www to http://galenabell.com (galenabell.com), so http://www.galenabell.com (www.galenabell.com) and just http://galenabell.com (galenabell.com) go to the same thing 
2018-04-06 16:44:41	gjabell	MX records are for mail servers, so you don't need to worry about those unless you are doing mail stuff (or have a website gmail account, etc) 
2018-04-06 16:45:12	gjabell	TXT records are basically just plaintext things you can stick onto domains, thye don't actually do anything for DNS lookup but you can use them for metadata and the like 
2018-04-06 16:45:34	gjabell	NS records are for specifying which DNS provider has the domain records 
2018-04-06 16:45:56	jesse	gootttchhhaaaa.. 
2018-04-06 16:46:02	gjabell	I haven't used any of the others tbh, but I imagine they have some use 
2018-04-06 16:46:33	gjabell	I can send you a screenshot of my cloudflare setup real quick 
2018-04-06 16:47:27	gjabell	@gjabell uploaded a file: https://sturgill-operators.slack.com/files/U5AUU7HHA/FA2NNLGHG/2018-04-06-164647_987x925_scrot.png (2018-04-06-164647 987x925 scrot) 
2018-04-06 16:47:41	gjabell	there's a bunch of extra stuff on there bc of the MX records 
2018-04-06 16:47:47	gjabell	but the top ones should give a bit of an idea 
2018-04-06 16:52:08	jesse	yeah it just doesn't seem to be working right. going to the domain name doesn't pull up the website im hosting. 
2018-04-06 16:52:30	gjabell	can you SS your cloudflare setup and google domain setup 
2018-04-06 16:52:31	gjabell	? 
2018-04-06 16:54:41	gjabell	actually I gotta go grab a package from tower, you want I can come over and help you set it up 
2018-04-06 16:54:58	jesse	sure! 
2018-04-06 16:55:23	gjabell	neato, I'll let you know when I'm outside 
2018-04-06 17:01:08	gjabell	Here 
2018-04-06 17:01:19	gjabell	Front doors 
2018-04-06 17:01:31	jesse	k 
2018-04-06 21:19:47	jesse	hey galen, I set up a matrix thingy 
2018-04-06 21:20:24	jesse	if ya wanna play around with it, you can just connect to 152.7.72.93:8008 
2018-04-06 21:21:14	jesse	I'm pretty sure it integrates well with other clients too so it doesn't need to be web-based. You could download an app on your phone. 
2018-04-06 21:33:08	gjabell	Neat 
2018-04-06 21:35:14	jesse	i guess I can't just do http://www.jessesimpsoncodes.com:8008 (www.jessesimpsoncodes.com:8008). I think it's cuz http://jessesimpsoncodes.com (jessesimpsoncodes.com) maps to port 80 by default :P 
2018-04-06 21:36:28	gjabell	I think you could, you just have to specify the port or it will default to 80 
2018-04-06 21:36:54	gjabell	I'm guessing I need custom creds for the server? 
2018-04-06 21:37:16	jesse	my browser just hangs there. 
2018-04-06 21:37:25	jesse	uhh you should be able to create an account 
2018-04-06 21:37:37	gjabell	Ah 
2018-04-06 21:37:51	gjabell	It's disabled xD 
2018-04-06 21:38:04	jesse	Ill make one for you then lol 
2018-04-06 21:38:08	gjabell	Also I'm  guessing it's not SSL? 
2018-04-06 21:40:00	jesse	whutz dat 
2018-04-06 21:40:03	jesse	im jk. 
2018-04-06 21:40:24	jesse	I might be able to make it SSL. 
2018-04-06 21:40:27	gjabell	XD 
2018-04-06 21:40:27	jesse	if it isn't 
2018-04-06 21:40:42	gjabell	Just throw a let's encrypt cert on the server and you should be good 
2018-04-06 21:40:50	jesse	hold on, I got a EOFError 
2018-04-06 21:40:55	gjabell	It'll need to be for your domain tho, can't do it for an ip 
2018-04-06 21:41:26	jesse	ok. you are 'galen' with password 'ilovekittens' 
2018-04-06 21:41:44	jesse	the eof error was me being dumb 
2018-04-06 22:03:16	gjabell	Lol xD 
2018-04-06 22:05:15	gjabell	It worked :D 
2018-04-06 22:05:36	jesse	pssh. of course it did. 
2018-04-06 22:07:20	jesse	its gonna take a lot of work to import all of the emojis, gifs, crappy css, and surveillance code from facebook... 
2018-04-06 22:09:10	gjabell	Lol xD 
2018-04-06 22:10:18	jesse	but don't worry, the surveillance code will be end to end encrypted so that the facebook creators can have their privacy 
2018-04-06 22:50:21	jesse	I got it. 
2018-04-07 10:19:00	jesse	do you run python programs directly in vim? 
2018-04-07 10:24:18	gjabell	No but I probably should xD 
2018-04-07 10:25:13	jesse	I remember seeing something in your vimrc that seems to indicate that you do lol. And I was thinking about our buffer problem haha 
2018-04-07 10:25:23	jesse	in i3/vim/tmux 
2018-04-07 10:40:08	gjabell	Lol yea 
2018-04-07 10:40:12	gjabell	Probably in there somewhere 
2018-04-07 13:22:45	gjabell	Lately I've been doing tmux split 70-30 vertically, with vim in the top half with nerdbar and tags, and a terminal in the bottom half for running shit 
2018-04-07 13:58:33	jesse	yeah that's what i do for when I'm coding minus the nerdbar/tags. ive played around a little bit with running python programs while in vim and its just weird. It closes out of the editting window, runs the program and opens the editting window back up... theres probably a better way to do that though 
2018-04-07 17:51:54	jesse	what group letter are you in for plm? 
2018-04-07 17:53:11	jesse	I'm trying to go through other people's code and see if I can improve anything about our card game 
2018-04-07 17:53:44	jesse	and I don't want to go through with some of the changes menzies suggested 
2018-04-07 18:56:15	gjabell	A 
2018-04-07 18:56:22	gjabell	It's bad lol 
2018-04-07 18:57:20	jesse	lol the other teams that ive seen didnt look too special so im sure you guys are fine. 
2018-04-07 19:13:59	gjabell	XD hopefully 
2018-04-07 19:52:12	jesse	honestly, your code is probably the easiest to read out of all the projects I went through. the fsm stuff is super hard to read and hard to debug. 
2018-04-07 19:55:16	jesse	the only complaints I have with your stuff would be anything that menzies recommended. (pretty much the o objects)  
2018-04-07 19:57:32	jesse	or things like the isA method... which again, seemed to be copied from menzies code...  
2018-04-07 20:00:26	gjabell	Thanks! Yeah the fsms are just kinda ugly unf
2018-04-07 20:00:26		XD I should probably change it lol
2018-04-07 20:00:26		And add more comments
2018-04-07 20:00:26		Also yes, I copied a fair bit from his base machine stuff as a starting point 
2018-04-07 20:03:49	jesse	Our project looks a lot more like something Menzies would like, but now I have to revert changes whenever I'm trying to modify anything because it's so much harder to work with. 
2018-04-07 20:04:01	gjabell	Lol 
2018-04-08 21:28:54		getting channel history...
2018-04-04 21:34:35	gjabell	^

2018-04-06 10:19:06	jesse	cool program ^ maybe my next raspberry pi project will use this. 
2018-04-06 10:20:01	gjabell	that's neat xD 
2018-04-06 10:20:07	gjabell	kinda want to try that now 
2018-04-06 10:22:42	jesse	sweet. Ive got homework to do, but if you do something cool, let me know haha 
2018-04-06 10:23:00	gjabell	I will haha, not sure if I'll get around to it today 
2018-04-06 10:24:17	jesse	lol okay. i might play with it tomorrow, but I'm pretty stacked on work so idk. 
2018-04-06 10:24:23	gjabell	yeah 
2018-04-06 10:28:57	jesse	btw, my research group found out that some web scraping tools in python by default ignore robots.txt ... which is really bad lol 
2018-04-06 10:29:03	gjabell	riip 
2018-04-06 15:24:32	jesse	I was looking into getting a domain name from google, and http://jessesimpson.com (jessesimpson.com) is taken :(  ... I'll need to find something like http://XxNinjaHackMasterButN0tRly23xX.org (XxNinjaHackMasterButN0tRly23xX.org) or something xD 
2018-04-06 15:24:49	gjabell	lol xD 
2018-04-06 15:25:01	jesse	it's gotta be more inconvenient than an ip address lol 
2018-04-06 15:25:16	gjabell	xD 
2018-04-06 15:25:21	gjabell	what's your middle initial 
2018-04-06 15:25:35	jesse	L 
2018-04-06 15:26:14	gjabell	hmm 
2018-04-06 15:26:20	gjabell	http://jlsimpson.com (jlsimpson.com) is taken 
2018-04-06 15:26:29	gjabell	http://jesselsimpson.com (jesselsimpson.com) isn't although it's a bit more confusing 
2018-04-06 15:26:37	gjabell	http://jls.com (jls.com) is too 
2018-04-06 15:26:47	gjabell	you could do http://jlscode.com (jlscode.com) 
2018-04-06 15:27:43	jesse	that one's not bad. 
2018-04-06 15:28:00	gjabell	http://jessesimpson.io (jessesimpson.io) is also but it's $60 a year 
2018-04-06 15:28:07	gjabell	which still isn't too bad but maybe not worth 
2018-04-06 15:28:16	jesse	well I do have http://jessesimpson36.github.io (jessesimpson36.github.io) xD 
2018-04-06 15:28:52	gjabell	http://jessesimpson36.com (jessesimpson36.com) is available xD 
2018-04-06 15:28:56	gjabell	why 36? 
2018-04-06 15:29:03	jesse	thats my github name 
2018-04-06 15:29:06	gjabell	ah 
2018-04-06 15:29:14	jesse	and my favorite number. 
2018-04-06 15:29:24	jesse	because it's my second favorite number squared... 
2018-04-06 15:29:28	gjabell	lol xD 
2018-04-06 15:29:39	gjabell	or maybe your second favorite number is your favorite number sqrted 
2018-04-06 15:29:48	gjabell	you could do http://jessesimps0n.com (jessesimps0n.com) lol 
2018-04-06 15:30:08	jesse	xD I'll just take the ip address if thats what im working with haha 
2018-04-06 15:30:18	gjabell	haha yeah 
2018-04-06 15:30:24	gjabell	probably less cringy lol 
2018-04-06 15:31:45	gjabell	you could do http://jessetheteadrinker.com (jessetheteadrinker.com) 
2018-04-06 15:31:51	gjabell	:P 
2018-04-06 15:32:39	jesse	lol  http://leeteaformea.com (leeteaformea.com) 
2018-04-06 15:33:01	jesse	cuz my middle name is lee 
2018-04-06 15:34:00	gjabell	why the a 
2018-04-06 15:34:32	jesse	cuz i wanted it to rhyme with tea ... and im stupid 
2018-04-06 15:34:49	gjabell	xD 
2018-04-06 15:34:57	gjabell	tee-uh 
2018-04-06 15:35:12	gjabell	you could get jessesimpson.codes for $50 a year 
2018-04-06 15:35:17	gjabell	that almost seems worth lol 
2018-04-06 15:35:42	gjabell	or go for a .me ending: http://leeteafor.me (leeteafor.me) 
2018-04-06 15:35:57	jesse	why is there an 's' on the end of code though?  
2018-04-06 15:35:58	gjabell	how about jessesimpson.coupons 
2018-04-06 15:36:01	jesse	xDDD 
2018-04-06 15:36:05	gjabell	idk, .code isn't available lol 
2018-04-06 15:36:16	gjabell	but I actually like the s, since you are coding 
2018-04-06 15:36:21	gjabell	hence, jesse simpson codes 
2018-04-06 15:37:17	jesse	yeah but 50$ a year makes me sad. that is a pretty good one though 
2018-04-06 15:37:28	gjabell	yeah that's the only downside 
2018-04-06 15:37:42	gjabell	you could do http://jessesimpsoncode.com (jessesimpsoncode.com) 
2018-04-06 15:37:52	gjabell	or http://jessesimpsoncodes.com (jessesimpsoncodes.com) 
2018-04-06 15:39:41	jesse	I might go with that one honestly. 
2018-04-06 15:39:51	gjabell	heck, just http://jessecode.com (jessecode.com) is available lol 
2018-04-06 15:40:07	gjabell	jessecodes isn't unf 
2018-04-06 15:40:34	gjabell	jessesimpson.computer is $30 a year xD 
2018-04-06 15:40:40	jesse	yeah I was checking jessecodes haha 
2018-04-06 15:42:21	jesse	http://jessehacks.com (jessehacks.com) is available. 
2018-04-06 15:42:50	gjabell	that's not bad 
2018-04-06 15:43:04	gjabell	although I'm not sure if that's necessarily a good one for business purposes haha 
2018-04-06 15:43:09	gjabell	people are ignorant :P 
2018-04-06 15:45:27	jesse	for the most part, I really just want it for screwing around with raspberry pi stuff. I don't really care about business purposes... but if they saw whatever i'm doing anyway, I guess it could be bad. 
2018-04-06 15:46:03	gjabell	that's fair, I'm thinking more if you end up hosting your website on it and are doing freelance work 
2018-04-06 15:46:15	gjabell	people are stupid, they might be less likely to hire someone if they think they are a 'hacker' 
2018-04-06 15:46:22	jesse	is that your goal for http://gjabell.com (gjabell.com)? 
2018-04-06 15:46:27	gjabell	I think the codes one would be better 
2018-04-06 15:46:40	gjabell	I have http://galenabell.com (galenabell.com), but yeah xD 
2018-04-06 15:46:50	gjabell	I need to get my website up again, just need to figure out what I want on it lol 
2018-04-06 15:47:12	gjabell	it's nice to have an actual domain tho bc you can do some neat stuff with subdomains 
2018-04-06 15:47:24	gjabell	so like http://git.galenabell.com (git.galenabell.com) goes to my gitlab, and http://plex.galenabell.com (plex.galenabell.com) goes to my plex 
2018-04-06 15:47:30	gjabell	I used to have others but they aren't up atm 
2018-04-06 15:50:49	jesse	Yeah. I'd like to be able to do something like that.  
2018-04-06 15:51:23	gjabell	i'd just get something you'd be comfortable using as your professional website domain 
2018-04-06 15:51:29	gjabell	and make subdomains off that 
2018-04-06 15:53:03	jesse	yeah. jessesimpsoncodes is good for that. maybe a little long but I guess it has to be since literally everything is taken lol 
2018-04-06 15:53:45	gjabell	haha yeah 
2018-04-06 15:53:54	gjabell	I think it's good tho bc it's pretty obvious what it is 
2018-04-06 15:54:09	gjabell	and it's easier to remember than some random 5 letter acronym or something lol 
2018-04-06 15:56:45	jesse	I agree. Thanks for the name galen!!! :P 
2018-04-06 15:57:23	gjabell	np :) 
2018-04-06 15:57:32	gjabell	let me know how it goes 
2018-04-06 16:33:21	jesse	you used cloudflare for ddns stuff right? 
2018-04-06 16:33:47	gjabell	yeah although you could also just use google's api if you got it through google domains 
2018-04-06 16:34:08	gjabell	I switched to cloudflare bc I couldn't get something to work with google's apis lol 
2018-04-06 16:36:10	jesse	meh. I trust your intuition. 
2018-04-06 16:36:22	gjabell	fair enough xD 
2018-04-06 16:36:34	gjabell	I like the idea of anti-ddos even though I doubt it will be an issue 
2018-04-06 16:36:38	gjabell	plus cloudflare also has a nice api 
2018-04-06 16:40:09	jesse	theres a lot of acronyms on the DNS part of the site  
2018-04-06 16:40:34	gjabell	lol yeah xD 
2018-04-06 16:40:38	gjabell	for cloudflare you mean? 
2018-04-06 16:41:23	jesse	yep 
2018-04-06 16:41:45	jesse	A AAAA CNAME, etc. its kinda confusing to me. 
2018-04-06 16:41:58	gjabell	ah, yeah 
2018-04-06 16:42:22	gjabell	so an 'A' record is basically a pointer from a domain name to an IP address 
2018-04-06 16:42:42	gjabell	ie http://galenabell.com (galenabell.com) -> 152.... yadda yadda 
2018-04-06 16:42:53	gjabell	AAAA records are the same as A records but for IPv6 
2018-04-06 16:43:04	gjabell	CNAME is an alias 
2018-04-06 16:43:16	gjabell	so on mine I have an A record from http://galenabell.com (galenabell.com) to my IP 
2018-04-06 16:43:24	gjabell	and I have a CNAME record from * to http://galenabell.com (galenabell.com) 
2018-04-06 16:43:53	gjabell	which basically says, if anyone goes to *.http://galenabell.com (galenabell.com) (any subdomain), direct them instead to http://galenabell.com (galenabell.com) (or whatever the IP it points at is) 
2018-04-06 16:44:13	gjabell	and I have another one from www to http://galenabell.com (galenabell.com), so http://www.galenabell.com (www.galenabell.com) and just http://galenabell.com (galenabell.com) go to the same thing 
2018-04-06 16:44:41	gjabell	MX records are for mail servers, so you don't need to worry about those unless you are doing mail stuff (or have a website gmail account, etc) 
2018-04-06 16:45:12	gjabell	TXT records are basically just plaintext things you can stick onto domains, thye don't actually do anything for DNS lookup but you can use them for metadata and the like 
2018-04-06 16:45:34	gjabell	NS records are for specifying which DNS provider has the domain records 
2018-04-06 16:45:56	jesse	gootttchhhaaaa.. 
2018-04-06 16:46:02	gjabell	I haven't used any of the others tbh, but I imagine they have some use 
2018-04-06 16:46:33	gjabell	I can send you a screenshot of my cloudflare setup real quick 
2018-04-06 16:47:27	gjabell	@gjabell uploaded a file: https://sturgill-operators.slack.com/files/U5AUU7HHA/FA2NNLGHG/2018-04-06-164647_987x925_scrot.png (2018-04-06-164647 987x925 scrot) 
2018-04-06 16:47:41	gjabell	there's a bunch of extra stuff on there bc of the MX records 
2018-04-06 16:47:47	gjabell	but the top ones should give a bit of an idea 
2018-04-06 16:52:08	jesse	yeah it just doesn't seem to be working right. going to the domain name doesn't pull up the website im hosting. 
2018-04-06 16:52:30	gjabell	can you SS your cloudflare setup and google domain setup 
2018-04-06 16:52:31	gjabell	? 
2018-04-06 16:54:41	gjabell	actually I gotta go grab a package from tower, you want I can come over and help you set it up 
2018-04-06 16:54:58	jesse	sure! 
2018-04-06 16:55:23	gjabell	neato, I'll let you know when I'm outside 
2018-04-06 17:01:08	gjabell	Here 
2018-04-06 17:01:19	gjabell	Front doors 
2018-04-06 17:01:31	jesse	k 
2018-04-06 21:19:47	jesse	hey galen, I set up a matrix thingy 
2018-04-06 21:20:24	jesse	if ya wanna play around with it, you can just connect to 152.7.72.93:8008 
2018-04-06 21:21:14	jesse	I'm pretty sure it integrates well with other clients too so it doesn't need to be web-based. You could download an app on your phone. 
2018-04-06 21:33:08	gjabell	Neat 
2018-04-06 21:35:14	jesse	i guess I can't just do http://www.jessesimpsoncodes.com:8008 (www.jessesimpsoncodes.com:8008). I think it's cuz http://jessesimpsoncodes.com (jessesimpsoncodes.com) maps to port 80 by default :P 
2018-04-06 21:36:28	gjabell	I think you could, you just have to specify the port or it will default to 80 
2018-04-06 21:36:54	gjabell	I'm guessing I need custom creds for the server? 
2018-04-06 21:37:16	jesse	my browser just hangs there. 
2018-04-06 21:37:25	jesse	uhh you should be able to create an account 
2018-04-06 21:37:37	gjabell	Ah 
2018-04-06 21:37:51	gjabell	It's disabled xD 
2018-04-06 21:38:04	jesse	Ill make one for you then lol 
2018-04-06 21:38:08	gjabell	Also I'm  guessing it's not SSL? 
2018-04-06 21:40:00	jesse	whutz dat 
2018-04-06 21:40:03	jesse	im jk. 
2018-04-06 21:40:24	jesse	I might be able to make it SSL. 
2018-04-06 21:40:27	gjabell	XD 
2018-04-06 21:40:27	jesse	if it isn't 
2018-04-06 21:40:42	gjabell	Just throw a let's encrypt cert on the server and you should be good 
2018-04-06 21:40:50	jesse	hold on, I got a EOFError 
2018-04-06 21:40:55	gjabell	It'll need to be for your domain tho, can't do it for an ip 
2018-04-06 21:41:26	jesse	ok. you are 'galen' with password 'ilovekittens' 
2018-04-06 21:41:44	jesse	the eof error was me being dumb 
2018-04-06 22:03:16	gjabell	Lol xD 
2018-04-06 22:05:15	gjabell	It worked :D 
2018-04-06 22:05:36	jesse	pssh. of course it did. 
2018-04-06 22:07:20	jesse	its gonna take a lot of work to import all of the emojis, gifs, crappy css, and surveillance code from facebook... 
2018-04-06 22:09:10	gjabell	Lol xD 
2018-04-06 22:10:18	jesse	but don't worry, the surveillance code will be end to end encrypted so that the facebook creators can have their privacy 
2018-04-06 22:50:21	jesse	I got it. 
2018-04-07 10:19:00	jesse	do you run python programs directly in vim? 
2018-04-07 10:24:18	gjabell	No but I probably should xD 
2018-04-07 10:25:13	jesse	I remember seeing something in your vimrc that seems to indicate that you do lol. And I was thinking about our buffer problem haha 
2018-04-07 10:25:23	jesse	in i3/vim/tmux 
2018-04-07 10:40:08	gjabell	Lol yea 
2018-04-07 10:40:12	gjabell	Probably in there somewhere 
2018-04-07 13:22:45	gjabell	Lately I've been doing tmux split 70-30 vertically, with vim in the top half with nerdbar and tags, and a terminal in the bottom half for running shit 
2018-04-07 13:58:33	jesse	yeah that's what i do for when I'm coding minus the nerdbar/tags. ive played around a little bit with running python programs while in vim and its just weird. It closes out of the editting window, runs the program and opens the editting window back up... theres probably a better way to do that though 
2018-04-07 17:51:54	jesse	what group letter are you in for plm? 
2018-04-07 17:53:11	jesse	I'm trying to go through other people's code and see if I can improve anything about our card game 
2018-04-07 17:53:44	jesse	and I don't want to go through with some of the changes menzies suggested 
2018-04-07 18:56:15	gjabell	A 
2018-04-07 18:56:22	gjabell	It's bad lol 
2018-04-07 18:57:20	jesse	lol the other teams that ive seen didnt look too special so im sure you guys are fine. 
2018-04-07 19:13:59	gjabell	XD hopefully 
2018-04-07 19:52:12	jesse	honestly, your code is probably the easiest to read out of all the projects I went through. the fsm stuff is super hard to read and hard to debug. 
2018-04-07 19:55:16	jesse	the only complaints I have with your stuff would be anything that menzies recommended. (pretty much the o objects)  
2018-04-07 19:57:32	jesse	or things like the isA method... which again, seemed to be copied from menzies code...  
2018-04-07 20:00:26	gjabell	Thanks! Yeah the fsms are just kinda ugly unf
2018-04-07 20:00:26		XD I should probably change it lol
2018-04-07 20:00:26		And add more comments
2018-04-07 20:00:26		Also yes, I copied a fair bit from his base machine stuff as a starting point 
2018-04-07 20:03:49	jesse	Our project looks a lot more like something Menzies would like, but now I have to revert changes whenever I'm trying to modify anything because it's so much harder to work with. 
2018-04-07 20:04:01	gjabell	Lol 
2018-04-08 16:37:33	gjabell	you still down to study tomorrow? 
2018-04-08 16:37:50	jesse	Yessir!! 
2018-04-08 16:38:24	gjabell	cool :) 
2018-04-08 16:38:29	gjabell	are you going to class? 
2018-04-08 16:49:19	jesse	nope 
2018-04-08 16:49:28	jesse	didnt we agree to skip? 
2018-04-08 16:49:28	gjabell	k 
2018-04-08 16:49:33	gjabell	that's what I was thinking yeah 
2018-04-08 16:49:43	jesse	thought id forget? 
2018-04-08 16:49:46	gjabell	wanna just study around then? 
2018-04-08 16:49:49	gjabell	nah just making sure xD 
2018-04-08 16:50:24	jesse	xD yeaaa Ill be free as early as you want. 
2018-04-08 16:50:29	gjabell	ok cool xD 
2018-04-08 16:50:39	gjabell	looks like josh wants in too, I told him we're skipping lol 
2018-04-08 16:51:08	jesse	yeayy!! where should we meet? 
2018-04-08 16:52:44	gjabell	up to you, might want to see where josh wants to meet too 
2018-04-08 16:52:49	gjabell	somewhere with tea, pref xD 
2018-04-08 16:53:20	jesse	agreed 
2018-04-08 21:25:48	jesse	so I set up Kodi on my pi, but I dont really have any reason to do this since my laptop has so much more storage than the pi. 
2018-04-08 21:26:04	jesse	its fun to set up junk though 
2018-04-08 21:30:07	gjabell	XD yeah 
2018-04-08 21:32:26	jesse	it's also a bit of a pain cuz kodi doesn't allow viewing through VNC.. which means I have to hook up the pi to my tv if I want to configure something 
2018-04-08 21:33:29	gjabell	Does Kodi not have a web interface 
2018-04-08 21:33:31	gjabell	? 
2018-04-08 21:34:27	jesse	It does, but it's a bit limited.  
2018-04-08 21:35:27	gjabell	Ah 
2018-04-08 21:35:30	gjabell	Plex all the way xD 
2018-04-08 21:36:58	jesse	Plex doesn't run on raspberry pis. the packages are out of date. 
2018-04-08 21:37:11	jesse	and its not open source bruh 
2018-04-08 21:38:27	gjabell	Rip 
2018-04-08 21:46:54	jesse	this is really cool. I just played a song 
2018-04-08 21:50:38	gjabell	Lol 
2018-04-08 21:51:28	jesse	and from my computer I can play it either on my pc or the audio thing that the pi is connected to... so my tv. 
2018-04-08 21:52:01	jesse	might even be able to bluetooth it to my google home... for like... no reason, cuz i could do that with my phone anyway 
2018-04-08 22:09:11	gjabell	Lol xD 
2018-04-08 22:09:22	gjabell	You could also set up an mpd server :) 
2018-04-08 22:10:15	jesse	mpd couldn't stream video 
2018-04-08 22:10:47	jesse	but still, that is a good point.. since mpd would connect with google play well. 
2018-04-08 23:50:52	gjabell	Yeah true 
2018-04-09 13:31:35		getting channel history...
2018-04-06 15:26:20	gjabell	http://jlsimpson.com (jlsimpson.com) is taken 
2018-04-06 15:26:29	gjabell	http://jesselsimpson.com (jesselsimpson.com) isn't although it's a bit more confusing 
2018-04-06 15:26:37	gjabell	http://jls.com (jls.com) is too 
2018-04-06 15:26:47	gjabell	you could do http://jlscode.com (jlscode.com) 
2018-04-06 15:27:43	jesse	that one's not bad. 
2018-04-06 15:28:00	gjabell	http://jessesimpson.io (jessesimpson.io) is also but it's $60 a year 
2018-04-06 15:28:07	gjabell	which still isn't too bad but maybe not worth 
2018-04-06 15:28:16	jesse	well I do have http://jessesimpson36.github.io (jessesimpson36.github.io) xD 
2018-04-06 15:28:52	gjabell	http://jessesimpson36.com (jessesimpson36.com) is available xD 
2018-04-06 15:28:56	gjabell	why 36? 
2018-04-06 15:29:03	jesse	thats my github name 
2018-04-06 15:29:06	gjabell	ah 
2018-04-06 15:29:14	jesse	and my favorite number. 
2018-04-06 15:29:24	jesse	because it's my second favorite number squared... 
2018-04-06 15:29:28	gjabell	lol xD 
2018-04-06 15:29:39	gjabell	or maybe your second favorite number is your favorite number sqrted 
2018-04-06 15:29:48	gjabell	you could do http://jessesimps0n.com (jessesimps0n.com) lol 
2018-04-06 15:30:08	jesse	xD I'll just take the ip address if thats what im working with haha 
2018-04-06 15:30:18	gjabell	haha yeah 
2018-04-06 15:30:24	gjabell	probably less cringy lol 
2018-04-06 15:31:45	gjabell	you could do http://jessetheteadrinker.com (jessetheteadrinker.com) 
2018-04-06 15:31:51	gjabell	:P 
2018-04-06 15:32:39	jesse	lol  http://leeteaformea.com (leeteaformea.com) 
2018-04-06 15:33:01	jesse	cuz my middle name is lee 
2018-04-06 15:34:00	gjabell	why the a 
2018-04-06 15:34:32	jesse	cuz i wanted it to rhyme with tea ... and im stupid 
2018-04-06 15:34:49	gjabell	xD 
2018-04-06 15:34:57	gjabell	tee-uh 
2018-04-06 15:35:12	gjabell	you could get jessesimpson.codes for $50 a year 
2018-04-06 15:35:17	gjabell	that almost seems worth lol 
2018-04-06 15:35:42	gjabell	or go for a .me ending: http://leeteafor.me (leeteafor.me) 
2018-04-06 15:35:57	jesse	why is there an 's' on the end of code though?  
2018-04-06 15:35:58	gjabell	how about jessesimpson.coupons 
2018-04-06 15:36:01	jesse	xDDD 
2018-04-06 15:36:05	gjabell	idk, .code isn't available lol 
2018-04-06 15:36:16	gjabell	but I actually like the s, since you are coding 
2018-04-06 15:36:21	gjabell	hence, jesse simpson codes 
2018-04-06 15:37:17	jesse	yeah but 50$ a year makes me sad. that is a pretty good one though 
2018-04-06 15:37:28	gjabell	yeah that's the only downside 
2018-04-06 15:37:42	gjabell	you could do http://jessesimpsoncode.com (jessesimpsoncode.com) 
2018-04-06 15:37:52	gjabell	or http://jessesimpsoncodes.com (jessesimpsoncodes.com) 
2018-04-06 15:39:41	jesse	I might go with that one honestly. 
2018-04-06 15:39:51	gjabell	heck, just http://jessecode.com (jessecode.com) is available lol 
2018-04-06 15:40:07	gjabell	jessecodes isn't unf 
2018-04-06 15:40:34	gjabell	jessesimpson.computer is $30 a year xD 
2018-04-06 15:40:40	jesse	yeah I was checking jessecodes haha 
2018-04-06 15:42:21	jesse	http://jessehacks.com (jessehacks.com) is available. 
2018-04-06 15:42:50	gjabell	that's not bad 
2018-04-06 15:43:04	gjabell	although I'm not sure if that's necessarily a good one for business purposes haha 
2018-04-06 15:43:09	gjabell	people are ignorant :P 
2018-04-06 15:45:27	jesse	for the most part, I really just want it for screwing around with raspberry pi stuff. I don't really care about business purposes... but if they saw whatever i'm doing anyway, I guess it could be bad. 
2018-04-06 15:46:03	gjabell	that's fair, I'm thinking more if you end up hosting your website on it and are doing freelance work 
2018-04-06 15:46:15	gjabell	people are stupid, they might be less likely to hire someone if they think they are a 'hacker' 
2018-04-06 15:46:22	jesse	is that your goal for http://gjabell.com (gjabell.com)? 
2018-04-06 15:46:27	gjabell	I think the codes one would be better 
2018-04-06 15:46:40	gjabell	I have http://galenabell.com (galenabell.com), but yeah xD 
2018-04-06 15:46:50	gjabell	I need to get my website up again, just need to figure out what I want on it lol 
2018-04-06 15:47:12	gjabell	it's nice to have an actual domain tho bc you can do some neat stuff with subdomains 
2018-04-06 15:47:24	gjabell	so like http://git.galenabell.com (git.galenabell.com) goes to my gitlab, and http://plex.galenabell.com (plex.galenabell.com) goes to my plex 
2018-04-06 15:47:30	gjabell	I used to have others but they aren't up atm 
2018-04-06 15:50:49	jesse	Yeah. I'd like to be able to do something like that.  
2018-04-06 15:51:23	gjabell	i'd just get something you'd be comfortable using as your professional website domain 
2018-04-06 15:51:29	gjabell	and make subdomains off that 
2018-04-06 15:53:03	jesse	yeah. jessesimpsoncodes is good for that. maybe a little long but I guess it has to be since literally everything is taken lol 
2018-04-06 15:53:45	gjabell	haha yeah 
2018-04-06 15:53:54	gjabell	I think it's good tho bc it's pretty obvious what it is 
2018-04-06 15:54:09	gjabell	and it's easier to remember than some random 5 letter acronym or something lol 
2018-04-06 15:56:45	jesse	I agree. Thanks for the name galen!!! :P 
2018-04-06 15:57:23	gjabell	np :) 
2018-04-06 15:57:32	gjabell	let me know how it goes 
2018-04-06 16:33:21	jesse	you used cloudflare for ddns stuff right? 
2018-04-06 16:33:47	gjabell	yeah although you could also just use google's api if you got it through google domains 
2018-04-06 16:34:08	gjabell	I switched to cloudflare bc I couldn't get something to work with google's apis lol 
2018-04-06 16:36:10	jesse	meh. I trust your intuition. 
2018-04-06 16:36:22	gjabell	fair enough xD 
2018-04-06 16:36:34	gjabell	I like the idea of anti-ddos even though I doubt it will be an issue 
2018-04-06 16:36:38	gjabell	plus cloudflare also has a nice api 
2018-04-06 16:40:09	jesse	theres a lot of acronyms on the DNS part of the site  
2018-04-06 16:40:34	gjabell	lol yeah xD 
2018-04-06 16:40:38	gjabell	for cloudflare you mean? 
2018-04-06 16:41:23	jesse	yep 
2018-04-06 16:41:45	jesse	A AAAA CNAME, etc. its kinda confusing to me. 
2018-04-06 16:41:58	gjabell	ah, yeah 
2018-04-06 16:42:22	gjabell	so an 'A' record is basically a pointer from a domain name to an IP address 
2018-04-06 16:42:42	gjabell	ie http://galenabell.com (galenabell.com) -> 152.... yadda yadda 
2018-04-06 16:42:53	gjabell	AAAA records are the same as A records but for IPv6 
2018-04-06 16:43:04	gjabell	CNAME is an alias 
2018-04-06 16:43:16	gjabell	so on mine I have an A record from http://galenabell.com (galenabell.com) to my IP 
2018-04-06 16:43:24	gjabell	and I have a CNAME record from * to http://galenabell.com (galenabell.com) 
2018-04-06 16:43:53	gjabell	which basically says, if anyone goes to *.http://galenabell.com (galenabell.com) (any subdomain), direct them instead to http://galenabell.com (galenabell.com) (or whatever the IP it points at is) 
2018-04-06 16:44:13	gjabell	and I have another one from www to http://galenabell.com (galenabell.com), so http://www.galenabell.com (www.galenabell.com) and just http://galenabell.com (galenabell.com) go to the same thing 
2018-04-06 16:44:41	gjabell	MX records are for mail servers, so you don't need to worry about those unless you are doing mail stuff (or have a website gmail account, etc) 
2018-04-06 16:45:12	gjabell	TXT records are basically just plaintext things you can stick onto domains, thye don't actually do anything for DNS lookup but you can use them for metadata and the like 
2018-04-06 16:45:34	gjabell	NS records are for specifying which DNS provider has the domain records 
2018-04-06 16:45:56	jesse	gootttchhhaaaa.. 
2018-04-06 16:46:02	gjabell	I haven't used any of the others tbh, but I imagine they have some use 
2018-04-06 16:46:33	gjabell	I can send you a screenshot of my cloudflare setup real quick 
2018-04-06 16:47:27	gjabell	@gjabell uploaded a file: https://sturgill-operators.slack.com/files/U5AUU7HHA/FA2NNLGHG/2018-04-06-164647_987x925_scrot.png (2018-04-06-164647 987x925 scrot) 
2018-04-06 16:47:41	gjabell	there's a bunch of extra stuff on there bc of the MX records 
2018-04-06 16:47:47	gjabell	but the top ones should give a bit of an idea 
2018-04-06 16:52:08	jesse	yeah it just doesn't seem to be working right. going to the domain name doesn't pull up the website im hosting. 
2018-04-06 16:52:30	gjabell	can you SS your cloudflare setup and google domain setup 
2018-04-06 16:52:31	gjabell	? 
2018-04-06 16:54:41	gjabell	actually I gotta go grab a package from tower, you want I can come over and help you set it up 
2018-04-06 16:54:58	jesse	sure! 
2018-04-06 16:55:23	gjabell	neato, I'll let you know when I'm outside 
2018-04-06 17:01:08	gjabell	Here 
2018-04-06 17:01:19	gjabell	Front doors 
2018-04-06 17:01:31	jesse	k 
2018-04-06 21:19:47	jesse	hey galen, I set up a matrix thingy 
2018-04-06 21:20:24	jesse	if ya wanna play around with it, you can just connect to 152.7.72.93:8008 
2018-04-06 21:21:14	jesse	I'm pretty sure it integrates well with other clients too so it doesn't need to be web-based. You could download an app on your phone. 
2018-04-06 21:33:08	gjabell	Neat 
2018-04-06 21:35:14	jesse	i guess I can't just do http://www.jessesimpsoncodes.com:8008 (www.jessesimpsoncodes.com:8008). I think it's cuz http://jessesimpsoncodes.com (jessesimpsoncodes.com) maps to port 80 by default :P 
2018-04-06 21:36:28	gjabell	I think you could, you just have to specify the port or it will default to 80 
2018-04-06 21:36:54	gjabell	I'm guessing I need custom creds for the server? 
2018-04-06 21:37:16	jesse	my browser just hangs there. 
2018-04-06 21:37:25	jesse	uhh you should be able to create an account 
2018-04-06 21:37:37	gjabell	Ah 
2018-04-06 21:37:51	gjabell	It's disabled xD 
2018-04-06 21:38:04	jesse	Ill make one for you then lol 
2018-04-06 21:38:08	gjabell	Also I'm  guessing it's not SSL? 
2018-04-06 21:40:00	jesse	whutz dat 
2018-04-06 21:40:03	jesse	im jk. 
2018-04-06 21:40:24	jesse	I might be able to make it SSL. 
2018-04-06 21:40:27	gjabell	XD 
2018-04-06 21:40:27	jesse	if it isn't 
2018-04-06 21:40:42	gjabell	Just throw a let's encrypt cert on the server and you should be good 
2018-04-06 21:40:50	jesse	hold on, I got a EOFError 
2018-04-06 21:40:55	gjabell	It'll need to be for your domain tho, can't do it for an ip 
2018-04-06 21:41:26	jesse	ok. you are 'galen' with password 'ilovekittens' 
2018-04-06 21:41:44	jesse	the eof error was me being dumb 
2018-04-06 22:03:16	gjabell	Lol xD 
2018-04-06 22:05:15	gjabell	It worked :D 
2018-04-06 22:05:36	jesse	pssh. of course it did. 
2018-04-06 22:07:20	jesse	its gonna take a lot of work to import all of the emojis, gifs, crappy css, and surveillance code from facebook... 
2018-04-06 22:09:10	gjabell	Lol xD 
2018-04-06 22:10:18	jesse	but don't worry, the surveillance code will be end to end encrypted so that the facebook creators can have their privacy 
2018-04-06 22:50:21	jesse	I got it. 
2018-04-07 10:19:00	jesse	do you run python programs directly in vim? 
2018-04-07 10:24:18	gjabell	No but I probably should xD 
2018-04-07 10:25:13	jesse	I remember seeing something in your vimrc that seems to indicate that you do lol. And I was thinking about our buffer problem haha 
2018-04-07 10:25:23	jesse	in i3/vim/tmux 
2018-04-07 10:40:08	gjabell	Lol yea 
2018-04-07 10:40:12	gjabell	Probably in there somewhere 
2018-04-07 13:22:45	gjabell	Lately I've been doing tmux split 70-30 vertically, with vim in the top half with nerdbar and tags, and a terminal in the bottom half for running shit 
2018-04-07 13:58:33	jesse	yeah that's what i do for when I'm coding minus the nerdbar/tags. ive played around a little bit with running python programs while in vim and its just weird. It closes out of the editting window, runs the program and opens the editting window back up... theres probably a better way to do that though 
2018-04-07 17:51:54	jesse	what group letter are you in for plm? 
2018-04-07 17:53:11	jesse	I'm trying to go through other people's code and see if I can improve anything about our card game 
2018-04-07 17:53:44	jesse	and I don't want to go through with some of the changes menzies suggested 
2018-04-07 18:56:15	gjabell	A 
2018-04-07 18:56:22	gjabell	It's bad lol 
2018-04-07 18:57:20	jesse	lol the other teams that ive seen didnt look too special so im sure you guys are fine. 
2018-04-07 19:13:59	gjabell	XD hopefully 
2018-04-07 19:52:12	jesse	honestly, your code is probably the easiest to read out of all the projects I went through. the fsm stuff is super hard to read and hard to debug. 
2018-04-07 19:55:16	jesse	the only complaints I have with your stuff would be anything that menzies recommended. (pretty much the o objects)  
2018-04-07 19:57:32	jesse	or things like the isA method... which again, seemed to be copied from menzies code...  
2018-04-07 20:00:26	gjabell	Thanks! Yeah the fsms are just kinda ugly unf
2018-04-07 20:00:26		XD I should probably change it lol
2018-04-07 20:00:26		And add more comments
2018-04-07 20:00:26		Also yes, I copied a fair bit from his base machine stuff as a starting point 
2018-04-07 20:03:49	jesse	Our project looks a lot more like something Menzies would like, but now I have to revert changes whenever I'm trying to modify anything because it's so much harder to work with. 
2018-04-07 20:04:01	gjabell	Lol 
2018-04-08 16:37:33	gjabell	you still down to study tomorrow? 
2018-04-08 16:37:50	jesse	Yessir!! 
2018-04-08 16:38:24	gjabell	cool :) 
2018-04-08 16:38:29	gjabell	are you going to class? 
2018-04-08 16:49:19	jesse	nope 
2018-04-08 16:49:28	jesse	didnt we agree to skip? 
2018-04-08 16:49:28	gjabell	k 
2018-04-08 16:49:33	gjabell	that's what I was thinking yeah 
2018-04-08 16:49:43	jesse	thought id forget? 
2018-04-08 16:49:46	gjabell	wanna just study around then? 
2018-04-08 16:49:49	gjabell	nah just making sure xD 
2018-04-08 16:50:24	jesse	xD yeaaa Ill be free as early as you want. 
2018-04-08 16:50:29	gjabell	ok cool xD 
2018-04-08 16:50:39	gjabell	looks like josh wants in too, I told him we're skipping lol 
2018-04-08 16:51:08	jesse	yeayy!! where should we meet? 
2018-04-08 16:52:44	gjabell	up to you, might want to see where josh wants to meet too 
2018-04-08 16:52:49	gjabell	somewhere with tea, pref xD 
2018-04-08 16:53:20	jesse	agreed 
2018-04-08 21:25:48	jesse	so I set up Kodi on my pi, but I dont really have any reason to do this since my laptop has so much more storage than the pi. 
2018-04-08 21:26:04	jesse	its fun to set up junk though 
2018-04-08 21:30:07	gjabell	XD yeah 
2018-04-08 21:32:26	jesse	it's also a bit of a pain cuz kodi doesn't allow viewing through VNC.. which means I have to hook up the pi to my tv if I want to configure something 
2018-04-08 21:33:29	gjabell	Does Kodi not have a web interface 
2018-04-08 21:33:31	gjabell	? 
2018-04-08 21:34:27	jesse	It does, but it's a bit limited.  
2018-04-08 21:35:27	gjabell	Ah 
2018-04-08 21:35:30	gjabell	Plex all the way xD 
2018-04-08 21:36:58	jesse	Plex doesn't run on raspberry pis. the packages are out of date. 
2018-04-08 21:37:11	jesse	and its not open source bruh 
2018-04-08 21:38:27	gjabell	Rip 
2018-04-08 21:46:54	jesse	this is really cool. I just played a song 
2018-04-08 21:50:38	gjabell	Lol 
2018-04-08 21:51:28	jesse	and from my computer I can play it either on my pc or the audio thing that the pi is connected to... so my tv. 
2018-04-08 21:52:01	jesse	might even be able to bluetooth it to my google home... for like... no reason, cuz i could do that with my phone anyway 
2018-04-08 22:09:11	gjabell	Lol xD 
2018-04-08 22:09:22	gjabell	You could also set up an mpd server :) 
2018-04-08 22:10:15	jesse	mpd couldn't stream video 
2018-04-08 22:10:47	jesse	but still, that is a good point.. since mpd would connect with google play well. 
2018-04-08 23:50:52	gjabell	Yeah true 
2018-04-09 13:31:16	gjabell	https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QKBY_mSEiwBkO8DD4Spuvuxk7sQIWuP-L6WQpgTBleg/edit 
2018-04-09 17:00:23	gjabell	wow, matrix is a lot easier to set up than I thought lol 
2018-04-09 17:02:14	jesse	xD yeah it was pretty simple. 
2018-04-09 17:03:33	gjabell	it looks like you can run it over https by just doing a reverse proxy with let's encrypt, too 
2018-04-09 17:06:51	jesse	Ahh yes! I of course know that!!  and how to set all that stuff up too!! 
2018-04-09 17:07:13	jesse	xD 
2018-04-09 17:08:23	jesse	I don't actually know what it means to run something over https... I'd assume it's just another program that encrypts something.  
2018-04-09 17:09:05	jesse	But I do know that the croud goes wild when the 's' is put at the end of https 
2018-04-09 17:09:09	jesse	crowd* 
2018-04-09 17:14:28	gjabell	lol xD 
2018-04-09 17:14:40	gjabell	just means the traffic is encrypt, plain and simple 
2018-04-09 17:14:49	gjabell	which is good bc you don't want josh tracking your location :P 
2018-04-09 17:15:59	jesse	xD. If I went to a plain-text website with no form of input, would someone be able to track my location if I was just using http? 
2018-04-09 17:16:25	gjabell	eh, maybe not 
2018-04-09 17:16:43	gjabell	but they'd see any communication between you and that website 
2018-04-09 17:16:58	gjabell	so if for some reason you were sending cookies, etc. it would be plaintext 
2018-04-09 17:19:29	gjabell	so quick question, when you set up matrix, did you set up federation? 
2018-04-09 17:21:04	jesse	I used synapse or synaptic or something. 
2018-04-09 17:21:22	gjabell	Yeah, matrix synapse is the server 
2018-04-09 17:21:44	gjabell	Did you need to run anything on port 8448 when you set it up? 
2018-04-09 17:23:51	jesse	I know something is running on port 8448, but I don't remember setting it up 
2018-04-09 17:24:00	gjabell	hmm ok 
2018-04-09 17:24:17	gjabell	bc if everything's setup correctly I should be able to message you from my server 
2018-04-09 17:24:35	gjabell	altho I think your server might be down now that I look at it 
2018-04-09 17:24:57	gjabell	at least the matrix server, looks like your website is still up 
2018-04-09 17:25:25	jesse	you are correct. I'm gonna demand my money back from amazon 
2018-04-09 17:25:30	gjabell	x 
2018-04-09 17:25:31	gjabell	xd 
2018-04-09 17:25:36	jesse	idk why it's down lol 
2018-04-09 17:25:39	gjabell	rip 
2018-04-09 17:25:43	gjabell	check the service 
2018-04-09 17:26:08	jesse	is it bad I don't remember the service name? 
2018-04-09 17:26:16	gjabell	lol xD 
2018-04-09 17:26:21	gjabell	might be matrix-synapse 
2018-04-09 17:29:03	jesse	that was wrong, but I got it up 
2018-04-09 17:29:33	gjabell	rip, what was it 
2018-04-09 17:30:05	jesse	source .synapse/bin/activate ;  synctl start 
2018-04-09 17:30:25	gjabell	oh, you installed it through souce 
2018-04-09 17:30:26	gjabell	source* 
2018-04-09 17:30:47	gjabell	if you restarted the pi it probably didn't restart matrix as well 
2018-04-09 17:31:43	gjabell	unf I still don't seem to be able to DM you from my server 
2018-04-09 17:31:48	gjabell	altho my client can connect now 
2018-04-09 17:32:00	gjabell	I wonder if it doesn't like it not being secure or something 
2018-04-09 17:32:10	jesse	yeah. I've restarted the pi a few times. have you created a user? 
2018-04-09 17:32:19	gjabell	on mine, yes 
2018-04-09 17:32:29	gjabell	I can connect to mine fine 
2018-04-09 17:32:41	gjabell	I should be able to send you messages from mine afaik but it doesn't recognize it 
2018-04-09 17:33:02	jesse	what's your username and domain/ 
2018-04-09 17:33:03	jesse	? 
2018-04-09 17:33:12	gjabell	@gjabell: 
2018-04-09 17:33:17	gjabell	fak 
2018-04-09 17:33:23	gjabell	'@gjabell:http://galenabell.com (galenabell.com)' 
2018-04-09 17:33:28	gjabell	without the quoates 
2018-04-09 17:34:52	jesse	you're giving me internal server errors lol 
2018-04-09 17:36:36	gjabell	rip 
2018-04-09 17:37:06	gjabell	can you SS the riot page 
2018-04-09 17:39:01	jesse	riot page? 
2018-04-09 17:39:20	gjabell	how are you trying to connect 
2018-04-09 17:39:47	jesse	oh I've been using the web interface. I can use riot though if ya want 
2018-04-09 17:40:33	gjabell	which web interface 
2018-04-09 17:40:51	gjabell	not sure if it matters, works for me on riot but any of them should work if it's set up right 
2018-04-09 17:41:32	jesse	the one on port :8008 on my IP... I should be able to connect to yours through my ip. 
2018-04-09 17:42:10	gjabell	wait, it has a web interface? 
2018-04-09 17:42:55	jesse	yea.  
2018-04-09 17:43:03	gjabell	lol rip I didn't even realize 
2018-04-09 17:43:05	jesse	that's how I messaged you the first time 
2018-04-09 17:43:06	gjabell	I've just been using http://riot.im (riot.im) 
2018-04-09 17:43:08	gjabell	oh 
2018-04-09 17:46:45	gjabell	if you log into your server, can you send me a message on mine? 
2018-04-09 17:47:17	jesse	i think i should be able to 
2018-04-09 17:47:23	gjabell	does it work tho 
2018-04-09 17:47:28	gjabell	that's the real question xD 
2018-04-09 17:48:49	jesse	nope 
2018-04-09 17:48:54	gjabell	rip 
2018-04-09 17:49:14	gjabell	I wonder if I configured it wrong... 
2018-04-09 17:49:19	gjabell	cause I feel like it should be working 
2018-04-09 17:50:18	gjabell	wait did you try https 
2018-04-09 17:50:44	gjabell	oohhh wait a min 
2018-04-09 17:50:50	jesse	nope I did not try https 
2018-04-09 17:50:51	gjabell	did you add srv dns records to yours 
2018-04-09 17:51:29	jesse	I don't think so? 
2018-04-09 17:51:38	gjabell	ok, that's probably why I can't see yours 
2018-04-09 17:51:49	gjabell	bc if I run mine through their checker it shows up as being valid 
2018-04-09 17:52:04	gjabell	apparently you have to add a _srv dns record to your dns to get everything to work 
2018-04-09 17:52:12	gjabell	not honestly sure what it's for but hey 
2018-04-09 17:52:19	jesse	how do i do that? 
2018-04-09 17:52:23	gjabell	so if you go to cloudflare, and go to your dns page 
2018-04-09 17:52:30	gjabell	at the top change it from A to srv 
2018-04-09 17:53:02	gjabell	in the thing that pops up, change your service name to _matrix and your name to your domainname 
2018-04-09 17:53:45	gjabell	then in the next prompt put 10 0 and 8448 for the priority, weight, and port 
2018-04-09 17:53:52	gjabell	then save and add record 
2018-04-09 17:54:03	jesse	done 
2018-04-09 17:54:41	gjabell	well your invitations show up now :D 
2018-04-09 17:54:45	gjabell	unf they are forbidden lol 
2018-04-09 17:55:48	jesse	what? lol 
2018-04-09 17:55:58	jesse	maybe I gotta do the cert thing 
2018-04-09 17:56:00	gjabell	idk it won't let me accept them 
2018-04-09 17:56:05	gjabell	just says 'Forbidden' 
2018-04-09 17:56:08	gjabell	probably a good idea yea 
2018-04-09 17:57:22	gjabell	when you set up the matrix server what did you use for the hostname 
2018-04-09 17:58:27	jesse	jessesimpsoncodes.com i think. 
2018-04-09 17:58:35	gjabell	ok 
2018-04-09 17:58:36	jesse	or maybe it just didn't ask me 
2018-04-09 17:59:13	gjabell	weird, so your server shows up as being valid now 
2018-04-09 17:59:18	gjabell	so it should be working I would think 
2018-04-09 18:00:40	jesse	really? cuz I just shut stuff down 
2018-04-09 18:00:52	gjabell	well that would explain why I can't find the server now lol xD 
2018-04-09 18:01:00	gjabell	it probably checked it before you shut it down 
2018-04-09 18:01:53	gjabell	when it's up again try sending me a DM invite 
2018-04-09 18:02:56	jesse	its up but I couldn't run acme cuz there was other things running. I don't even remember what was on port 80 so I wouldn't know what to shut down. 
2018-04-09 18:03:07	gjabell	probably apache 
2018-04-09 18:03:10	gjabell	running your website 
2018-04-09 18:07:12	jesse	man acme is a huge pain 
2018-04-09 18:07:21	gjabell	are you running acme.sh? 
2018-04-09 18:07:30	gjabell	cause I didn't have any issues with it on my end 
2018-04-09 18:07:41	gjabell	although I was just grabbing certs, not configuring apache with it 
2018-04-09 18:10:20	gjabell	you could also try using caddy, it's free and super easy to setup 
2018-04-09 18:10:32	gjabell	and it'll do the https stuff for you so you don't have to use acme 
2018-04-09 18:11:05	jesse	yeah. acme is just complaining. first it wanted me to shut down the website and then it complained about it not being up. but anyway, I just got acme to renew the cert... although it said the one I had was already valid anyway 
2018-04-09 18:11:16	gjabell	lol 
2018-04-09 18:11:24	gjabell	yeah it's fine for 2 months or something like that 
2018-04-09 18:11:33	gjabell	do you want to try caddy? 
2018-04-09 18:11:43	jesse	sure 
2018-04-09 18:11:46	gjabell	ok 
2018-04-09 18:12:38	gjabell	you're going to run this: curl https://getcaddy.com | bash -s personal 
2018-04-09 18:12:40	gjabell	to install it 
2018-04-09 18:12:46	jesse	do I need to remove apache2?? 
2018-04-09 18:12:52	gjabell	probably a good idea yea 
2018-04-09 18:13:50	jesse	what is personal? 
2018-04-09 18:13:55	gjabell	personal license 
2018-04-09 18:14:06	gjabell	they have a business license too but you have to pay for it 
2018-04-09 18:19:17	jesse	it doesn't seem to be making a difference 
2018-04-09 18:19:28	gjabell	have you actually set up caddy? 
2018-04-09 18:19:38	gjabell	bc installing it doesn't actually get it all working 
2018-04-09 18:19:39	jesse	yeah, and ran it 
2018-04-09 18:20:31	gjabell	what's your caddyfile 
2018-04-09 18:21:46	jesse	didn't make one 
2018-04-09 18:21:59	gjabell	ok so try this 
2018-04-09 18:22:07	gjabell	mkdir /etc/caddy 
2018-04-09 18:22:38	gjabell	mkdir -p /var/www/ 
2018-04-09 18:22:53	gjabell	make an index.html file in /var/www/ and put some random shit in it 
2018-04-09 18:23:01	gjabell	vim /etc/caddy/Caddyfile 
2018-04-09 18:23:26	gjabell	in the caddyfile put http://jessesimpsoncodes.com (jessesimpsoncodes.com) { 
2018-04-09 18:23:31	gjabell	root /var/www 
2018-04-09 18:23:33	gjabell	gzip 
2018-04-09 18:23:40	gjabell	tls [your email] 
2018-04-09 18:23:40	gjabell	} 
2018-04-09 18:24:09	gjabell	then try running caddy -conf=/etc/caddy/Caddyfile 
2018-04-09 18:24:23	gjabell	and see if you can hit your server ip in a web browser to bring up the page 
2018-04-09 18:27:31	jesse	i got a no such file or directory error 
2018-04-09 18:27:51	gjabell	any output from the console? 
2018-04-09 18:28:23	jesse	Activating privacy features... 2018/04/09 22:28:01 open /home/pi/.caddy/acme/acme-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/sites/(jessesimpsoncodes.com)/(jessesimpsoncodes.com).crt: no such file or directory 
2018-04-09 18:29:20	gjabell	can you ss your caddyfile? 
2018-04-09 18:30:26	jesse	@jesse uploaded a file: https://sturgill-operators.slack.com/files/U3VPX29FW/FA3RVVADQ/scrot.png (scrot) 
2018-04-09 18:30:55	gjabell	change the url line to just 'http://jessesimpsoncodes.com (jessesimpsoncodes.com)' (without quotes) 
2018-04-09 18:31:00	gjabell	just domain, no http, nothing 
2018-04-09 18:32:49	jesse	thats the same line... with the exception of the curly bracket 
2018-04-09 18:33:38	gjabell	I think slack is doing weird stuff with the urls I am sending you

2018-04-09 18:35:13	gjabell	if you just put the url it will redirect http to https and get a cert for htttps 
2018-04-09 18:35:16	gjabell	https* 
2018-04-09 18:36:49	jesse	it seemed to work now... but I forgot what problem we were trying to fix...  I saw your invitation but it gives me a Forbidden error when I try to open it 
2018-04-09 18:37:03	gjabell	ok so that was just a test 
2018-04-09 18:37:11	gjabell	now we need to add the matrix server 
2018-04-09 18:37:32	gjabell	although now that I think about it you are running it directly on http://jessesimpsoncodes.com (jessesimpsoncodes.com) right? 
2018-04-09 18:37:39	gjabell	not with a subdomain or anything 
2018-04-09 18:37:48	gjabell	cause I don't know how well it will work without a subdomain 
2018-04-09 18:38:31	gjabell	also if you are running caddy as a proxy you should probably make it a service 
2018-04-09 18:38:39	gjabell	so if you restart the pi it comes back up properly 
2018-04-09 18:38:53	jesse	its on a different port. 
2018-04-09 18:39:33	gjabell	yeah but the problem is you have no way of knowing if a request going to http://jessesimpsoncodes.com (jessesimpsoncodes.com) is going to your website or the matrix server 
2018-04-09 18:39:45	gjabell	I think we might be able to fix it easily tho 
2018-04-09 18:40:15	jesse	idk how to set jessesimpsoncodes.com to point to 8008 
2018-04-09 18:40:28	gjabell	I can help 
2018-04-09 18:40:36	gjabell	are your matrix configs in /etc/matrix-synapse? 
2018-04-09 18:41:11	jesse	i think its in .synapse 
2018-04-09 18:41:13	gjabell	ok 
2018-04-09 18:41:16	gjabell	go into that 
2018-04-09 18:41:25	gjabell	is there a conf.d folder? 
2018-04-09 18:41:44	jesse	nop 
2018-04-09 18:41:51	gjabell	what about homeserver.yaml 
2018-04-09 18:41:59	gjabell	or anything called server-name.yaml 
2018-04-09 18:43:04	jesse	yea that works 
2018-04-09 18:43:13	gjabell	which one lol 
2018-04-09 18:43:30	jesse	homeserver.yaml 
2018-04-09 18:43:41	gjabell	open that and see if there's a server_name anywhere 
2018-04-09 18:43:58	jesse	btw, I can let you ssh into my pi... and we can tmux to the same environment lol 
2018-04-09 18:44:08	gjabell	if you want xD 
2018-04-09 18:44:16	gjabell	didn't know you could share tmux that's neat 
2018-04-09 18:44:18	gjabell	makes sense tho 
2018-04-09 18:44:42	jesse	gimme an ssh key :P 
2018-04-09 18:45:04	gjabell	@gjabell uploaded a file: https://sturgill-operators.slack.com/files/U5AUU7HHA/FA39YT84R/id_rsa.pub (id rsa) 
2018-04-09 18:46:09	jesse	idk how to update the change but i updated the file of authorized keys 
2018-04-09 18:46:27	gjabell	shouldn't need an update I don't think 
2018-04-09 18:46:32	gjabell	what's the user? 
2018-04-09 18:47:00	jesse	pi 
2018-04-09 18:47:22	jesse	just run 'tmux a' when ya get in 
2018-04-09 18:47:24	gjabell	kk 
2018-04-09 18:47:46	gjabell	can I ssh through the domain? 
2018-04-09 18:47:49	gjabell	or do I need the ip 
2018-04-09 18:48:31	jesse	ssh pi@152.7.72.93 
2018-04-09 18:48:42	jesse	idk if you can use the domain lol 
2018-04-09 18:48:53	gjabell	doesn't look like it rip 
2018-04-09 18:48:55	gjabell	ip works tho 
2018-04-09 18:50:52	gjabell	how do you restart synapse 
2018-04-09 19:45:41	jesse	@jesse uploaded a file: https://sturgill-operators.slack.com/files/U3VPX29FW/FA365CK0Q/scrot.png (scrot) 
2018-04-09 21:30:29		getting channel history...
2018-04-09 17:14:49	gjabell	which is good bc you don't want josh tracking your location :P 
2018-04-09 17:15:59	jesse	xD. If I went to a plain-text website with no form of input, would someone be able to track my location if I was just using http? 
2018-04-09 17:16:25	gjabell	eh, maybe not 
2018-04-09 17:16:43	gjabell	but they'd see any communication between you and that website 
2018-04-09 17:16:58	gjabell	so if for some reason you were sending cookies, etc. it would be plaintext 
2018-04-09 17:19:29	gjabell	so quick question, when you set up matrix, did you set up federation? 
2018-04-09 17:21:04	jesse	I used synapse or synaptic or something. 
2018-04-09 17:21:22	gjabell	Yeah, matrix synapse is the server 
2018-04-09 17:21:44	gjabell	Did you need to run anything on port 8448 when you set it up? 
2018-04-09 17:23:51	jesse	I know something is running on port 8448, but I don't remember setting it up 
2018-04-09 17:24:00	gjabell	hmm ok 
2018-04-09 17:24:17	gjabell	bc if everything's setup correctly I should be able to message you from my server 
2018-04-09 17:24:35	gjabell	altho I think your server might be down now that I look at it 
2018-04-09 17:24:57	gjabell	at least the matrix server, looks like your website is still up 
2018-04-09 17:25:25	jesse	you are correct. I'm gonna demand my money back from amazon 
2018-04-09 17:25:30	gjabell	x 
2018-04-09 17:25:31	gjabell	xd 
2018-04-09 17:25:36	jesse	idk why it's down lol 
2018-04-09 17:25:39	gjabell	rip 
2018-04-09 17:25:43	gjabell	check the service 
2018-04-09 17:26:08	jesse	is it bad I don't remember the service name? 
2018-04-09 17:26:16	gjabell	lol xD 
2018-04-09 17:26:21	gjabell	might be matrix-synapse 
2018-04-09 17:29:03	jesse	that was wrong, but I got it up 
2018-04-09 17:29:33	gjabell	rip, what was it 
2018-04-09 17:30:05	jesse	source .synapse/bin/activate ;  synctl start 
2018-04-09 17:30:25	gjabell	oh, you installed it through souce 
2018-04-09 17:30:26	gjabell	source* 
2018-04-09 17:30:47	gjabell	if you restarted the pi it probably didn't restart matrix as well 
2018-04-09 17:31:43	gjabell	unf I still don't seem to be able to DM you from my server 
2018-04-09 17:31:48	gjabell	altho my client can connect now 
2018-04-09 17:32:00	gjabell	I wonder if it doesn't like it not being secure or something 
2018-04-09 17:32:10	jesse	yeah. I've restarted the pi a few times. have you created a user? 
2018-04-09 17:32:19	gjabell	on mine, yes 
2018-04-09 17:32:29	gjabell	I can connect to mine fine 
2018-04-09 17:32:41	gjabell	I should be able to send you messages from mine afaik but it doesn't recognize it 
2018-04-09 17:33:02	jesse	what's your username and domain/ 
2018-04-09 17:33:03	jesse	? 
2018-04-09 17:33:12	gjabell	@gjabell: 
2018-04-09 17:33:17	gjabell	fak 
2018-04-09 17:33:23	gjabell	'@gjabell:http://galenabell.com (galenabell.com)' 
2018-04-09 17:33:28	gjabell	without the quoates 
2018-04-09 17:34:52	jesse	you're giving me internal server errors lol 
2018-04-09 17:36:36	gjabell	rip 
2018-04-09 17:37:06	gjabell	can you SS the riot page 
2018-04-09 17:39:01	jesse	riot page? 
2018-04-09 17:39:20	gjabell	how are you trying to connect 
2018-04-09 17:39:47	jesse	oh I've been using the web interface. I can use riot though if ya want 
2018-04-09 17:40:33	gjabell	which web interface 
2018-04-09 17:40:51	gjabell	not sure if it matters, works for me on riot but any of them should work if it's set up right 
2018-04-09 17:41:32	jesse	the one on port :8008 on my IP... I should be able to connect to yours through my ip. 
2018-04-09 17:42:10	gjabell	wait, it has a web interface? 
2018-04-09 17:42:55	jesse	yea.  
2018-04-09 17:43:03	gjabell	lol rip I didn't even realize 
2018-04-09 17:43:05	jesse	that's how I messaged you the first time 
2018-04-09 17:43:06	gjabell	I've just been using http://riot.im (riot.im) 
2018-04-09 17:43:08	gjabell	oh 
2018-04-09 17:46:45	gjabell	if you log into your server, can you send me a message on mine? 
2018-04-09 17:47:17	jesse	i think i should be able to 
2018-04-09 17:47:23	gjabell	does it work tho 
2018-04-09 17:47:28	gjabell	that's the real question xD 
2018-04-09 17:48:49	jesse	nope 
2018-04-09 17:48:54	gjabell	rip 
2018-04-09 17:49:14	gjabell	I wonder if I configured it wrong... 
2018-04-09 17:49:19	gjabell	cause I feel like it should be working 
2018-04-09 17:50:18	gjabell	wait did you try https 
2018-04-09 17:50:44	gjabell	oohhh wait a min 
2018-04-09 17:50:50	jesse	nope I did not try https 
2018-04-09 17:50:51	gjabell	did you add srv dns records to yours 
2018-04-09 17:51:29	jesse	I don't think so? 
2018-04-09 17:51:38	gjabell	ok, that's probably why I can't see yours 
2018-04-09 17:51:49	gjabell	bc if I run mine through their checker it shows up as being valid 
2018-04-09 17:52:04	gjabell	apparently you have to add a _srv dns record to your dns to get everything to work 
2018-04-09 17:52:12	gjabell	not honestly sure what it's for but hey 
2018-04-09 17:52:19	jesse	how do i do that? 
2018-04-09 17:52:23	gjabell	so if you go to cloudflare, and go to your dns page 
2018-04-09 17:52:30	gjabell	at the top change it from A to srv 
2018-04-09 17:53:02	gjabell	in the thing that pops up, change your service name to _matrix and your name to your domainname 
2018-04-09 17:53:45	gjabell	then in the next prompt put 10 0 and 8448 for the priority, weight, and port 
2018-04-09 17:53:52	gjabell	then save and add record 
2018-04-09 17:54:03	jesse	done 
2018-04-09 17:54:41	gjabell	well your invitations show up now :D 
2018-04-09 17:54:45	gjabell	unf they are forbidden lol 
2018-04-09 17:55:48	jesse	what? lol 
2018-04-09 17:55:58	jesse	maybe I gotta do the cert thing 
2018-04-09 17:56:00	gjabell	idk it won't let me accept them 
2018-04-09 17:56:05	gjabell	just says 'Forbidden' 
2018-04-09 17:56:08	gjabell	probably a good idea yea 
2018-04-09 17:57:22	gjabell	when you set up the matrix server what did you use for the hostname 
2018-04-09 17:58:27	jesse	http://jessesimpsoncodes.com (jessesimpsoncodes.com) i think. 
2018-04-09 17:58:35	gjabell	ok 
2018-04-09 17:58:36	jesse	or maybe it just didn't ask me 
2018-04-09 17:59:13	gjabell	weird, so your server shows up as being valid now 
2018-04-09 17:59:18	gjabell	so it should be working I would think 
2018-04-09 18:00:40	jesse	really? cuz I just shut stuff down 
2018-04-09 18:00:52	gjabell	well that would explain why I can't find the server now lol xD 
2018-04-09 18:01:00	gjabell	it probably checked it before you shut it down 
2018-04-09 18:01:53	gjabell	when it's up again try sending me a DM invite 
2018-04-09 18:02:56	jesse	its up but I couldn't run acme cuz there was other things running. I don't even remember what was on port 80 so I wouldn't know what to shut down. 
2018-04-09 18:03:07	gjabell	probably apache 
2018-04-09 18:03:10	gjabell	running your website 
2018-04-09 18:07:12	jesse	man acme is a huge pain 
2018-04-09 18:07:21	gjabell	are you running acme.sh? 
2018-04-09 18:07:30	gjabell	cause I didn't have any issues with it on my end 
2018-04-09 18:07:41	gjabell	although I was just grabbing certs, not configuring apache with it 
2018-04-09 18:10:20	gjabell	you could also try using caddy, it's free and super easy to setup 
2018-04-09 18:10:32	gjabell	and it'll do the https stuff for you so you don't have to use acme 
2018-04-09 18:11:05	jesse	yeah. acme is just complaining. first it wanted me to shut down the website and then it complained about it not being up. but anyway, I just got acme to renew the cert... although it said the one I had was already valid anyway 
2018-04-09 18:11:16	gjabell	lol 
2018-04-09 18:11:24	gjabell	yeah it's fine for 2 months or something like that 
2018-04-09 18:11:33	gjabell	do you want to try caddy? 
2018-04-09 18:11:43	jesse	sure 
2018-04-09 18:11:46	gjabell	ok 
2018-04-09 18:12:38	gjabell	you're going to run this: curl https://getcaddy.com | bash -s personal 
2018-04-09 18:12:40	gjabell	to install it 
2018-04-09 18:12:46	jesse	do I need to remove apache2?? 
2018-04-09 18:12:52	gjabell	probably a good idea yea 
2018-04-09 18:13:50	jesse	what is personal? 
2018-04-09 18:13:55	gjabell	personal license 
2018-04-09 18:14:06	gjabell	they have a business license too but you have to pay for it 
2018-04-09 18:19:17	jesse	it doesn't seem to be making a difference 
2018-04-09 18:19:28	gjabell	have you actually set up caddy? 
2018-04-09 18:19:38	gjabell	bc installing it doesn't actually get it all working 
2018-04-09 18:19:39	jesse	yeah, and ran it 
2018-04-09 18:20:31	gjabell	what's your caddyfile 
2018-04-09 18:21:46	jesse	didn't make one 
2018-04-09 18:21:59	gjabell	ok so try this 
2018-04-09 18:22:07	gjabell	mkdir /etc/caddy 
2018-04-09 18:22:38	gjabell	mkdir -p /var/www/ 
2018-04-09 18:22:53	gjabell	make an index.html file in /var/www/ and put some random shit in it 
2018-04-09 18:23:01	gjabell	vim /etc/caddy/Caddyfile 
2018-04-09 18:23:26	gjabell	in the caddyfile put http://jessesimpsoncodes.com (jessesimpsoncodes.com) { 
2018-04-09 18:23:31	gjabell	root /var/www 
2018-04-09 18:23:33	gjabell	gzip 
2018-04-09 18:23:40	gjabell	tls [your email] 
2018-04-09 18:23:40	gjabell	} 
2018-04-09 18:24:09	gjabell	then try running caddy -conf=/etc/caddy/Caddyfile 
2018-04-09 18:24:23	gjabell	and see if you can hit your server ip in a web browser to bring up the page 
2018-04-09 18:27:31	jesse	i got a no such file or directory error 
2018-04-09 18:27:51	gjabell	any output from the console?

2018-04-09 18:30:55	gjabell	change the url line to just 'http://jessesimpsoncodes.com (jessesimpsoncodes.com)' (without quotes) 
2018-04-09 18:31:00	gjabell	just domain, no http, nothing 
2018-04-09 18:32:49	jesse	thats the same line... with the exception of the curly bracket 
2018-04-09 18:33:38	gjabell	I think slack is doing weird stuff with the urls I am sending you

2018-04-09 18:34:48	gjabell	got a bit cutoff whoops 
2018-04-09 18:34:55	gjabell	that's what it should look like 
2018-04-09 18:34:56	jesse	gotcha 
2018-04-09 18:35:13	gjabell	if you just put the url it will redirect http to https and get a cert for htttps 
2018-04-09 18:35:16	gjabell	https* 
2018-04-09 18:36:49	jesse	it seemed to work now... but I forgot what problem we were trying to fix...  I saw your invitation but it gives me a Forbidden error when I try to open it 
2018-04-09 18:37:03	gjabell	ok so that was just a test 
2018-04-09 18:37:11	gjabell	now we need to add the matrix server 
2018-04-09 18:37:32	gjabell	although now that I think about it you are running it directly on http://jessesimpsoncodes.com (jessesimpsoncodes.com) right? 
2018-04-09 18:37:39	gjabell	not with a subdomain or anything 
2018-04-09 18:37:48	gjabell	cause I don't know how well it will work without a subdomain 
2018-04-09 18:38:31	gjabell	also if you are running caddy as a proxy you should probably make it a service 
2018-04-09 18:38:39	gjabell	so if you restart the pi it comes back up properly 
2018-04-09 18:38:53	jesse	its on a different port. 
2018-04-09 18:39:33	gjabell	yeah but the problem is you have no way of knowing if a request going to http://jessesimpsoncodes.com (jessesimpsoncodes.com) is going to your website or the matrix server 
2018-04-09 18:39:45	gjabell	I think we might be able to fix it easily tho 
2018-04-09 18:40:15	jesse	idk how to set http://jessesimpsoncodes.com (jessesimpsoncodes.com) to point to 8008 
2018-04-09 18:40:28	gjabell	I can help 
2018-04-09 18:40:36	gjabell	are your matrix configs in /etc/matrix-synapse? 
2018-04-09 18:41:11	jesse	i think its in .synapse 
2018-04-09 18:41:13	gjabell	ok 
2018-04-09 18:41:16	gjabell	go into that 
2018-04-09 18:41:25	gjabell	is there a conf.d folder? 
2018-04-09 18:41:44	jesse	nop 
2018-04-09 18:41:51	gjabell	what about homeserver.yaml 
2018-04-09 18:41:59	gjabell	or anything called server-name.yaml 
2018-04-09 18:43:04	jesse	yea that works 
2018-04-09 18:43:13	gjabell	which one lol 
2018-04-09 18:43:30	jesse	homeserver.yaml 
2018-04-09 18:43:41	gjabell	open that and see if there's a server_name anywhere 
2018-04-09 18:43:58	jesse	btw, I can let you ssh into my pi... and we can tmux to the same environment lol 
2018-04-09 18:44:08	gjabell	if you want xD 
2018-04-09 18:44:16	gjabell	didn't know you could share tmux that's neat 
2018-04-09 18:44:18	gjabell	makes sense tho 
2018-04-09 18:44:42	jesse	gimme an ssh key :P 
2018-04-09 18:45:04	gjabell	@gjabell uploaded a file: https://sturgill-operators.slack.com/files/U5AUU7HHA/FA39YT84R/id_rsa.pub (id rsa) 
2018-04-09 18:46:09	jesse	idk how to update the change but i updated the file of authorized keys 
2018-04-09 18:46:27	gjabell	shouldn't need an update I don't think 
2018-04-09 18:46:32	gjabell	what's the user? 
2018-04-09 18:47:00	jesse	pi 
2018-04-09 18:47:22	jesse	just run 'tmux a' when ya get in 
2018-04-09 18:47:24	gjabell	kk 
2018-04-09 18:47:46	gjabell	can I ssh through the domain? 
2018-04-09 18:47:49	gjabell	or do I need the ip 
2018-04-09 18:48:31	jesse	ssh pi@152.7.72.93 
2018-04-09 18:48:42	jesse	idk if you can use the domain lol 
2018-04-09 18:48:53	gjabell	doesn't look like it rip 
2018-04-09 18:48:55	gjabell	ip works tho 
2018-04-09 18:50:52	gjabell	how do you restart synapse 
2018-04-09 19:45:41	jesse	@jesse uploaded a file: https://sturgill-operators.slack.com/files/U3VPX29FW/FA365CK0Q/scrot.png (scrot) 
2018-04-19 16:43:47		getting channel history...
2018-04-09 17:14:49	gjabell	which is good bc you don't want josh tracking your location :P 
2018-04-09 17:15:59	jesse	xD. If I went to a plain-text website with no form of input, would someone be able to track my location if I was just using http? 
2018-04-09 17:16:25	gjabell	eh, maybe not 
2018-04-09 17:16:43	gjabell	but they'd see any communication between you and that website 
2018-04-09 17:16:58	gjabell	so if for some reason you were sending cookies, etc. it would be plaintext 
2018-04-09 17:19:29	gjabell	so quick question, when you set up matrix, did you set up federation? 
2018-04-09 17:21:04	jesse	I used synapse or synaptic or something. 
2018-04-09 17:21:22	gjabell	Yeah, matrix synapse is the server 
2018-04-09 17:21:44	gjabell	Did you need to run anything on port 8448 when you set it up? 
2018-04-09 17:23:51	jesse	I know something is running on port 8448, but I don't remember setting it up 
2018-04-09 17:24:00	gjabell	hmm ok 
2018-04-09 17:24:17	gjabell	bc if everything's setup correctly I should be able to message you from my server 
2018-04-09 17:24:35	gjabell	altho I think your server might be down now that I look at it 
2018-04-09 17:24:57	gjabell	at least the matrix server, looks like your website is still up 
2018-04-09 17:25:25	jesse	you are correct. I'm gonna demand my money back from amazon 
2018-04-09 17:25:30	gjabell	x 
2018-04-09 17:25:31	gjabell	xd 
2018-04-09 17:25:36	jesse	idk why it's down lol 
2018-04-09 17:25:39	gjabell	rip 
2018-04-09 17:25:43	gjabell	check the service 
2018-04-09 17:26:08	jesse	is it bad I don't remember the service name? 
2018-04-09 17:26:16	gjabell	lol xD 
2018-04-09 17:26:21	gjabell	might be matrix-synapse 
2018-04-09 17:29:03	jesse	that was wrong, but I got it up 
2018-04-09 17:29:33	gjabell	rip, what was it 
2018-04-09 17:30:05	jesse	source .synapse/bin/activate ;  synctl start 
2018-04-09 17:30:25	gjabell	oh, you installed it through souce 
2018-04-09 17:30:26	gjabell	source* 
2018-04-09 17:30:47	gjabell	if you restarted the pi it probably didn't restart matrix as well 
2018-04-09 17:31:43	gjabell	unf I still don't seem to be able to DM you from my server 
2018-04-09 17:31:48	gjabell	altho my client can connect now 
2018-04-09 17:32:00	gjabell	I wonder if it doesn't like it not being secure or something 
2018-04-09 17:32:10	jesse	yeah. I've restarted the pi a few times. have you created a user? 
2018-04-09 17:32:19	gjabell	on mine, yes 
2018-04-09 17:32:29	gjabell	I can connect to mine fine 
2018-04-09 17:32:41	gjabell	I should be able to send you messages from mine afaik but it doesn't recognize it 
2018-04-09 17:33:02	jesse	what's your username and domain/ 
2018-04-09 17:33:03	jesse	? 
2018-04-09 17:33:12	gjabell	@gjabell: 
2018-04-09 17:33:17	gjabell	fak 
2018-04-09 17:33:23	gjabell	'@gjabell:http://galenabell.com (galenabell.com)' 
2018-04-09 17:33:28	gjabell	without the quoates 
2018-04-09 17:34:52	jesse	you're giving me internal server errors lol 
2018-04-09 17:36:36	gjabell	rip 
2018-04-09 17:37:06	gjabell	can you SS the riot page 
2018-04-09 17:39:01	jesse	riot page? 
2018-04-09 17:39:20	gjabell	how are you trying to connect 
2018-04-09 17:39:47	jesse	oh I've been using the web interface. I can use riot though if ya want 
2018-04-09 17:40:33	gjabell	which web interface 
2018-04-09 17:40:51	gjabell	not sure if it matters, works for me on riot but any of them should work if it's set up right 
2018-04-09 17:41:32	jesse	the one on port :8008 on my IP... I should be able to connect to yours through my ip. 
2018-04-09 17:42:10	gjabell	wait, it has a web interface? 
2018-04-09 17:42:55	jesse	yea.  
2018-04-09 17:43:03	gjabell	lol rip I didn't even realize 
2018-04-09 17:43:05	jesse	that's how I messaged you the first time 
2018-04-09 17:43:06	gjabell	I've just been using http://riot.im (riot.im) 
2018-04-09 17:43:08	gjabell	oh 
2018-04-09 17:46:45	gjabell	if you log into your server, can you send me a message on mine? 
2018-04-09 17:47:17	jesse	i think i should be able to 
2018-04-09 17:47:23	gjabell	does it work tho 
2018-04-09 17:47:28	gjabell	that's the real question xD 
2018-04-09 17:48:49	jesse	nope 
2018-04-09 17:48:54	gjabell	rip 
2018-04-09 17:49:14	gjabell	I wonder if I configured it wrong... 
2018-04-09 17:49:19	gjabell	cause I feel like it should be working 
2018-04-09 17:50:18	gjabell	wait did you try https 
2018-04-09 17:50:44	gjabell	oohhh wait a min 
2018-04-09 17:50:50	jesse	nope I did not try https 
2018-04-09 17:50:51	gjabell	did you add srv dns records to yours 
2018-04-09 17:51:29	jesse	I don't think so? 
2018-04-09 17:51:38	gjabell	ok, that's probably why I can't see yours 
2018-04-09 17:51:49	gjabell	bc if I run mine through their checker it shows up as being valid 
2018-04-09 17:52:04	gjabell	apparently you have to add a _srv dns record to your dns to get everything to work 
2018-04-09 17:52:12	gjabell	not honestly sure what it's for but hey 
2018-04-09 17:52:19	jesse	how do i do that? 
2018-04-09 17:52:23	gjabell	so if you go to cloudflare, and go to your dns page 
2018-04-09 17:52:30	gjabell	at the top change it from A to srv 
2018-04-09 17:53:02	gjabell	in the thing that pops up, change your service name to _matrix and your name to your domainname 
2018-04-09 17:53:45	gjabell	then in the next prompt put 10 0 and 8448 for the priority, weight, and port 
2018-04-09 17:53:52	gjabell	then save and add record 
2018-04-09 17:54:03	jesse	done 
2018-04-09 17:54:41	gjabell	well your invitations show up now :D 
2018-04-09 17:54:45	gjabell	unf they are forbidden lol 
2018-04-09 17:55:48	jesse	what? lol 
2018-04-09 17:55:58	jesse	maybe I gotta do the cert thing 
2018-04-09 17:56:00	gjabell	idk it won't let me accept them 
2018-04-09 17:56:05	gjabell	just says 'Forbidden' 
2018-04-09 17:56:08	gjabell	probably a good idea yea 
2018-04-09 17:57:22	gjabell	when you set up the matrix server what did you use for the hostname 
2018-04-09 17:58:27	jesse	http://jessesimpsoncodes.com (jessesimpsoncodes.com) i think. 
2018-04-09 17:58:35	gjabell	ok 
2018-04-09 17:58:36	jesse	or maybe it just didn't ask me 
2018-04-09 17:59:13	gjabell	weird, so your server shows up as being valid now 
2018-04-09 17:59:18	gjabell	so it should be working I would think 
2018-04-09 18:00:40	jesse	really? cuz I just shut stuff down 
2018-04-09 18:00:52	gjabell	well that would explain why I can't find the server now lol xD 
2018-04-09 18:01:00	gjabell	it probably checked it before you shut it down 
2018-04-09 18:01:53	gjabell	when it's up again try sending me a DM invite 
2018-04-09 18:02:56	jesse	its up but I couldn't run acme cuz there was other things running. I don't even remember what was on port 80 so I wouldn't know what to shut down. 
2018-04-09 18:03:07	gjabell	probably apache 
2018-04-09 18:03:10	gjabell	running your website 
2018-04-09 18:07:12	jesse	man acme is a huge pain 
2018-04-09 18:07:21	gjabell	are you running acme.sh? 
2018-04-09 18:07:30	gjabell	cause I didn't have any issues with it on my end 
2018-04-09 18:07:41	gjabell	although I was just grabbing certs, not configuring apache with it 
2018-04-09 18:10:20	gjabell	you could also try using caddy, it's free and super easy to setup 
2018-04-09 18:10:32	gjabell	and it'll do the https stuff for you so you don't have to use acme 
2018-04-09 18:11:05	jesse	yeah. acme is just complaining. first it wanted me to shut down the website and then it complained about it not being up. but anyway, I just got acme to renew the cert... although it said the one I had was already valid anyway 
2018-04-09 18:11:16	gjabell	lol 
2018-04-09 18:11:24	gjabell	yeah it's fine for 2 months or something like that 
2018-04-09 18:11:33	gjabell	do you want to try caddy? 
2018-04-09 18:11:43	jesse	sure 
2018-04-09 18:11:46	gjabell	ok 
2018-04-09 18:12:38	gjabell	you're going to run this: curl https://getcaddy.com | bash -s personal 
2018-04-09 18:12:40	gjabell	to install it 
2018-04-09 18:12:46	jesse	do I need to remove apache2?? 
2018-04-09 18:12:52	gjabell	probably a good idea yea 
2018-04-09 18:13:50	jesse	what is personal? 
2018-04-09 18:13:55	gjabell	personal license 
2018-04-09 18:14:06	gjabell	they have a business license too but you have to pay for it 
2018-04-09 18:19:17	jesse	it doesn't seem to be making a difference 
2018-04-09 18:19:28	gjabell	have you actually set up caddy? 
2018-04-09 18:19:38	gjabell	bc installing it doesn't actually get it all working 
2018-04-09 18:19:39	jesse	yeah, and ran it 
2018-04-09 18:20:31	gjabell	what's your caddyfile 
2018-04-09 18:21:46	jesse	didn't make one 
2018-04-09 18:21:59	gjabell	ok so try this 
2018-04-09 18:22:07	gjabell	mkdir /etc/caddy 
2018-04-09 18:22:38	gjabell	mkdir -p /var/www/ 
2018-04-09 18:22:53	gjabell	make an index.html file in /var/www/ and put some random shit in it 
2018-04-09 18:23:01	gjabell	vim /etc/caddy/Caddyfile 
2018-04-09 18:23:26	gjabell	in the caddyfile put http://jessesimpsoncodes.com (jessesimpsoncodes.com) { 
2018-04-09 18:23:31	gjabell	root /var/www 
2018-04-09 18:23:33	gjabell	gzip 
2018-04-09 18:23:40	gjabell	tls [your email] 
2018-04-09 18:23:40	gjabell	} 
2018-04-09 18:24:09	gjabell	then try running caddy -conf=/etc/caddy/Caddyfile 
2018-04-09 18:24:23	gjabell	and see if you can hit your server ip in a web browser to bring up the page 
2018-04-09 18:27:31	jesse	i got a no such file or directory error 
2018-04-09 18:27:51	gjabell	any output from the console? 
2018-04-09 18:28:23	jesse	Activating privacy features... 2018/04/09 22:28:01 open /home/pi/.caddy/acme/acme-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/sites/(http://jessesimpsoncodes.com (jessesimpsoncodes.com))/(http://jessesimpsoncodes.com (jessesimpsoncodes.com)).crt: no such file or directory 
2018-04-09 18:29:20	gjabell	can you ss your caddyfile? 
2018-04-09 18:30:26	jesse	@jesse uploaded a file: https://sturgill-operators.slack.com/files/U3VPX29FW/FA3RVVADQ/scrot.png (scrot) 
2018-04-09 18:30:55	gjabell	change the url line to just 'http://jessesimpsoncodes.com (jessesimpsoncodes.com)' (without quotes) 
2018-04-09 18:31:00	gjabell	just domain, no http, nothing 
2018-04-09 18:32:49	jesse	thats the same line... with the exception of the curly bracket 
2018-04-09 18:33:38	gjabell	I think slack is doing weird stuff with the urls I am sending you 
2018-04-09 18:33:40	gjabell	1s

2018-04-09 18:34:29	jesse	jessesimpsoncodes (jessesimpsoncodes) with the DOTcoms 
2018-04-09 18:34:48	gjabell	got a bit cutoff whoops 
2018-04-09 18:34:55	gjabell	that's what it should look like 
2018-04-09 18:34:56	jesse	gotcha 
2018-04-09 18:35:13	gjabell	if you just put the url it will redirect http to https and get a cert for htttps 
2018-04-09 18:35:16	gjabell	https* 
2018-04-09 18:36:49	jesse	it seemed to work now... but I forgot what problem we were trying to fix...  I saw your invitation but it gives me a Forbidden error when I try to open it 
2018-04-09 18:37:03	gjabell	ok so that was just a test 
2018-04-09 18:37:11	gjabell	now we need to add the matrix server 
2018-04-09 18:37:32	gjabell	although now that I think about it you are running it directly on http://jessesimpsoncodes.com (jessesimpsoncodes.com) right? 
2018-04-09 18:37:39	gjabell	not with a subdomain or anything 
2018-04-09 18:37:48	gjabell	cause I don't know how well it will work without a subdomain 
2018-04-09 18:38:31	gjabell	also if you are running caddy as a proxy you should probably make it a service 
2018-04-09 18:38:39	gjabell	so if you restart the pi it comes back up properly 
2018-04-09 18:38:53	jesse	its on a different port. 
2018-04-09 18:39:33	gjabell	yeah but the problem is you have no way of knowing if a request going to http://jessesimpsoncodes.com (jessesimpsoncodes.com) is going to your website or the matrix server 
2018-04-09 18:39:45	gjabell	I think we might be able to fix it easily tho 
2018-04-09 18:40:15	jesse	idk how to set http://jessesimpsoncodes.com (jessesimpsoncodes.com) to point to 8008 
2018-04-09 18:40:28	gjabell	I can help 
2018-04-09 18:40:36	gjabell	are your matrix configs in /etc/matrix-synapse? 
2018-04-09 18:41:11	jesse	i think its in .synapse 
2018-04-09 18:41:13	gjabell	ok 
2018-04-09 18:41:16	gjabell	go into that 
2018-04-09 18:41:25	gjabell	is there a conf.d folder? 
2018-04-09 18:41:44	jesse	nop 
2018-04-09 18:41:51	gjabell	what about homeserver.yaml 
2018-04-09 18:41:59	gjabell	or anything called server-name.yaml 
2018-04-09 18:43:04	jesse	yea that works 
2018-04-09 18:43:13	gjabell	which one lol 
2018-04-09 18:43:30	jesse	homeserver.yaml 
2018-04-09 18:43:41	gjabell	open that and see if there's a server_name anywhere 
2018-04-09 18:43:58	jesse	btw, I can let you ssh into my pi... and we can tmux to the same environment lol 
2018-04-09 18:44:08	gjabell	if you want xD 
2018-04-09 18:44:16	gjabell	didn't know you could share tmux that's neat 
2018-04-09 18:44:18	gjabell	makes sense tho 
2018-04-09 18:44:42	jesse	gimme an ssh key :P 
2018-04-09 18:45:04	gjabell	@gjabell uploaded a file: https://sturgill-operators.slack.com/files/U5AUU7HHA/FA39YT84R/id_rsa.pub (id rsa) 
2018-04-09 18:46:09	jesse	idk how to update the change but i updated the file of authorized keys 
2018-04-09 18:46:27	gjabell	shouldn't need an update I don't think 
2018-04-09 18:46:32	gjabell	what's the user? 
2018-04-09 18:47:00	jesse	pi 
2018-04-09 18:47:22	jesse	just run 'tmux a' when ya get in 
2018-04-09 18:47:24	gjabell	kk 
2018-04-09 18:47:46	gjabell	can I ssh through the domain? 
2018-04-09 18:47:49	gjabell	or do I need the ip 
2018-04-09 18:48:31	jesse	ssh pi@152.7.72.93 
2018-04-09 18:48:42	jesse	idk if you can use the domain lol 
2018-04-09 18:48:53	gjabell	doesn't look like it rip 
2018-04-09 18:48:55	gjabell	ip works tho 
2018-04-09 18:50:52	gjabell	how do you restart synapse 
2018-04-09 19:45:41	jesse	@jesse uploaded a file: https://sturgill-operators.slack.com/files/U3VPX29FW/FA365CK0Q/scrot.png (scrot) 
2018-04-26 09:13:12		getting channel history...
2018-04-09 17:14:49	gjabell	which is good bc you don't want josh tracking your location :P 
2018-04-09 17:15:59	jesse	xD. If I went to a plain-text website with no form of input, would someone be able to track my location if I was just using http? 
2018-04-09 17:16:25	gjabell	eh, maybe not 
2018-04-09 17:16:43	gjabell	but they'd see any communication between you and that website 
2018-04-09 17:16:58	gjabell	so if for some reason you were sending cookies, etc. it would be plaintext 
2018-04-09 17:19:29	gjabell	so quick question, when you set up matrix, did you set up federation? 
2018-04-09 17:21:04	jesse	I used synapse or synaptic or something. 
2018-04-09 17:21:22	gjabell	Yeah, matrix synapse is the server 
2018-04-09 17:21:44	gjabell	Did you need to run anything on port 8448 when you set it up? 
2018-04-09 17:23:51	jesse	I know something is running on port 8448, but I don't remember setting it up 
2018-04-09 17:24:00	gjabell	hmm ok 
2018-04-09 17:24:17	gjabell	bc if everything's setup correctly I should be able to message you from my server 
2018-04-09 17:24:35	gjabell	altho I think your server might be down now that I look at it 
2018-04-09 17:24:57	gjabell	at least the matrix server, looks like your website is still up 
2018-04-09 17:25:25	jesse	you are correct. I'm gonna demand my money back from amazon 
2018-04-09 17:25:30	gjabell	x 
2018-04-09 17:25:31	gjabell	xd 
2018-04-09 17:25:36	jesse	idk why it's down lol 
2018-04-09 17:25:39	gjabell	rip 
2018-04-09 17:25:43	gjabell	check the service 
2018-04-09 17:26:08	jesse	is it bad I don't remember the service name? 
2018-04-09 17:26:16	gjabell	lol xD 
2018-04-09 17:26:21	gjabell	might be matrix-synapse 
2018-04-09 17:29:03	jesse	that was wrong, but I got it up 
2018-04-09 17:29:33	gjabell	rip, what was it 
2018-04-09 17:30:05	jesse	source .synapse/bin/activate ;  synctl start 
2018-04-09 17:30:25	gjabell	oh, you installed it through souce 
2018-04-09 17:30:26	gjabell	source* 
2018-04-09 17:30:47	gjabell	if you restarted the pi it probably didn't restart matrix as well 
2018-04-09 17:31:43	gjabell	unf I still don't seem to be able to DM you from my server 
2018-04-09 17:31:48	gjabell	altho my client can connect now 
2018-04-09 17:32:00	gjabell	I wonder if it doesn't like it not being secure or something 
2018-04-09 17:32:10	jesse	yeah. I've restarted the pi a few times. have you created a user? 
2018-04-09 17:32:19	gjabell	on mine, yes 
2018-04-09 17:32:29	gjabell	I can connect to mine fine 
2018-04-09 17:32:41	gjabell	I should be able to send you messages from mine afaik but it doesn't recognize it 
2018-04-09 17:33:02	jesse	what's your username and domain/ 
2018-04-09 17:33:03	jesse	? 
2018-04-09 17:33:12	gjabell	@gjabell: 
2018-04-09 17:33:17	gjabell	fak 
2018-04-09 17:33:23	gjabell	'@gjabell:http://galenabell.com (galenabell.com)' 
2018-04-09 17:33:28	gjabell	without the quoates 
2018-04-09 17:34:52	jesse	you're giving me internal server errors lol 
2018-04-09 17:36:36	gjabell	rip 
2018-04-09 17:37:06	gjabell	can you SS the riot page 
2018-04-09 17:39:01	jesse	riot page? 
2018-04-09 17:39:20	gjabell	how are you trying to connect 
2018-04-09 17:39:47	jesse	oh I've been using the web interface. I can use riot though if ya want 
2018-04-09 17:40:33	gjabell	which web interface 
2018-04-09 17:40:51	gjabell	not sure if it matters, works for me on riot but any of them should work if it's set up right 
2018-04-09 17:41:32	jesse	the one on port :8008 on my IP... I should be able to connect to yours through my ip. 
2018-04-09 17:42:10	gjabell	wait, it has a web interface? 
2018-04-09 17:42:55	jesse	yea.  
2018-04-09 17:43:03	gjabell	lol rip I didn't even realize 
2018-04-09 17:43:05	jesse	that's how I messaged you the first time 
2018-04-09 17:43:06	gjabell	I've just been using http://riot.im (riot.im) 
2018-04-09 17:43:08	gjabell	oh 
2018-04-09 17:46:45	gjabell	if you log into your server, can you send me a message on mine? 
2018-04-09 17:47:17	jesse	i think i should be able to 
2018-04-09 17:47:23	gjabell	does it work tho 
2018-04-09 17:47:28	gjabell	that's the real question xD 
2018-04-09 17:48:49	jesse	nope 
2018-04-09 17:48:54	gjabell	rip 
2018-04-09 17:49:14	gjabell	I wonder if I configured it wrong... 
2018-04-09 17:49:19	gjabell	cause I feel like it should be working 
2018-04-09 17:50:18	gjabell	wait did you try https 
2018-04-09 17:50:44	gjabell	oohhh wait a min 
2018-04-09 17:50:50	jesse	nope I did not try https 
2018-04-09 17:50:51	gjabell	did you add srv dns records to yours 
2018-04-09 17:51:29	jesse	I don't think so? 
2018-04-09 17:51:38	gjabell	ok, that's probably why I can't see yours 
2018-04-09 17:51:49	gjabell	bc if I run mine through their checker it shows up as being valid 
2018-04-09 17:52:04	gjabell	apparently you have to add a _srv dns record to your dns to get everything to work 
2018-04-09 17:52:12	gjabell	not honestly sure what it's for but hey 
2018-04-09 17:52:19	jesse	how do i do that? 
2018-04-09 17:52:23	gjabell	so if you go to cloudflare, and go to your dns page 
2018-04-09 17:52:30	gjabell	at the top change it from A to srv 
2018-04-09 17:53:02	gjabell	in the thing that pops up, change your service name to _matrix and your name to your domainname 
2018-04-09 17:53:45	gjabell	then in the next prompt put 10 0 and 8448 for the priority, weight, and port 
2018-04-09 17:53:52	gjabell	then save and add record 
2018-04-09 17:54:03	jesse	done 
2018-04-09 17:54:41	gjabell	well your invitations show up now :D 
2018-04-09 17:54:45	gjabell	unf they are forbidden lol 
2018-04-09 17:55:48	jesse	what? lol 
2018-04-09 17:55:58	jesse	maybe I gotta do the cert thing 
2018-04-09 17:56:00	gjabell	idk it won't let me accept them 
2018-04-09 17:56:05	gjabell	just says 'Forbidden' 
2018-04-09 17:56:08	gjabell	probably a good idea yea 
2018-04-09 17:57:22	gjabell	when you set up the matrix server what did you use for the hostname 
2018-04-09 17:58:27	jesse	http://jessesimpsoncodes.com (jessesimpsoncodes.com) i think. 
2018-04-09 17:58:35	gjabell	ok 
2018-04-09 17:58:36	jesse	or maybe it just didn't ask me 
2018-04-09 17:59:13	gjabell	weird, so your server shows up as being valid now 
2018-04-09 17:59:18	gjabell	so it should be working I would think 
2018-04-09 18:00:40	jesse	really? cuz I just shut stuff down 
2018-04-09 18:00:52	gjabell	well that would explain why I can't find the server now lol xD 
2018-04-09 18:01:00	gjabell	it probably checked it before you shut it down 
2018-04-09 18:01:53	gjabell	when it's up again try sending me a DM invite 
2018-04-09 18:02:56	jesse	its up but I couldn't run acme cuz there was other things running. I don't even remember what was on port 80 so I wouldn't know what to shut down. 
2018-04-09 18:03:07	gjabell	probably apache 
2018-04-09 18:03:10	gjabell	running your website 
2018-04-09 18:07:12	jesse	man acme is a huge pain 
2018-04-09 18:07:21	gjabell	are you running acme.sh? 
2018-04-09 18:07:30	gjabell	cause I didn't have any issues with it on my end 
2018-04-09 18:07:41	gjabell	although I was just grabbing certs, not configuring apache with it 
2018-04-09 18:10:20	gjabell	you could also try using caddy, it's free and super easy to setup 
2018-04-09 18:10:32	gjabell	and it'll do the https stuff for you so you don't have to use acme 
2018-04-09 18:11:05	jesse	yeah. acme is just complaining. first it wanted me to shut down the website and then it complained about it not being up. but anyway, I just got acme to renew the cert... although it said the one I had was already valid anyway 
2018-04-09 18:11:16	gjabell	lol 
2018-04-09 18:11:24	gjabell	yeah it's fine for 2 months or something like that 
2018-04-09 18:11:33	gjabell	do you want to try caddy? 
2018-04-09 18:11:43	jesse	sure 
2018-04-09 18:11:46	gjabell	ok 
2018-04-09 18:12:38	gjabell	you're going to run this: curl https://getcaddy.com | bash -s personal 
2018-04-09 18:12:40	gjabell	to install it 
2018-04-09 18:12:46	jesse	do I need to remove apache2?? 
2018-04-09 18:12:52	gjabell	probably a good idea yea 
2018-04-09 18:13:50	jesse	what is personal? 
2018-04-09 18:13:55	gjabell	personal license 
2018-04-09 18:14:06	gjabell	they have a business license too but you have to pay for it 
2018-04-09 18:19:17	jesse	it doesn't seem to be making a difference 
2018-04-09 18:19:28	gjabell	have you actually set up caddy? 
2018-04-09 18:19:38	gjabell	bc installing it doesn't actually get it all working 
2018-04-09 18:19:39	jesse	yeah, and ran it 
2018-04-09 18:20:31	gjabell	what's your caddyfile 
2018-04-09 18:21:46	jesse	didn't make one 
2018-04-09 18:21:59	gjabell	ok so try this 
2018-04-09 18:22:07	gjabell	mkdir /etc/caddy 
2018-04-09 18:22:38	gjabell	mkdir -p /var/www/ 
2018-04-09 18:22:53	gjabell	make an index.html file in /var/www/ and put some random shit in it 
2018-04-09 18:23:01	gjabell	vim /etc/caddy/Caddyfile 
2018-04-09 18:23:26	gjabell	in the caddyfile put http://jessesimpsoncodes.com (jessesimpsoncodes.com) { 
2018-04-09 18:23:31	gjabell	root /var/www 
2018-04-09 18:23:33	gjabell	gzip 
2018-04-09 18:23:40	gjabell	tls [your email] 
2018-04-09 18:23:40	gjabell	} 
2018-04-09 18:24:09	gjabell	then try running caddy -conf=/etc/caddy/Caddyfile 
2018-04-09 18:24:23	gjabell	and see if you can hit your server ip in a web browser to bring up the page 
2018-04-09 18:27:31	jesse	i got a no such file or directory error 
2018-04-09 18:27:51	gjabell	any output from the console? 
2018-04-09 18:28:23	jesse	Activating privacy features... 2018/04/09 22:28:01 open /home/pi/.caddy/acme/acme-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/sites/(http://jessesimpsoncodes.com (jessesimpsoncodes.com))/(http://jessesimpsoncodes.com (jessesimpsoncodes.com)).crt: no such file or directory 
2018-04-09 18:29:20	gjabell	can you ss your caddyfile? 
2018-04-09 18:30:26	jesse	@jesse uploaded a file: https://sturgill-operators.slack.com/files/U3VPX29FW/FA3RVVADQ/scrot.png (scrot) 
2018-04-09 18:30:55	gjabell	change the url line to just 'http://jessesimpsoncodes.com (jessesimpsoncodes.com)' (without quotes) 
2018-04-09 18:31:00	gjabell	just domain, no http, nothing 
2018-04-09 18:32:49	jesse	thats the same line... with the exception of the curly bracket 
2018-04-09 18:33:38	gjabell	I think slack is doing weird stuff with the urls I am sending you 
2018-04-09 18:33:40	gjabell	1s 
2018-04-09 18:34:28	gjabell	@gjabell uploaded a file: https://sturgill-operators.slack.com/files/U5AUU7HHA/FA4TCKS2K/2018-04-09-183410_288x79_scrot.png (2018-04-09-183410 288x79 scrot) 
2018-04-09 18:34:29	jesse	jessesimpsoncodes (jessesimpsoncodes) with the DOTcoms 
2018-04-09 18:34:48	gjabell	got a bit cutoff whoops 
2018-04-09 18:34:55	gjabell	that's what it should look like 
2018-04-09 18:34:56	jesse	gotcha 
2018-04-09 18:35:13	gjabell	if you just put the url it will redirect http to https and get a cert for htttps 
2018-04-09 18:35:16	gjabell	https* 
2018-04-09 18:36:49	jesse	it seemed to work now... but I forgot what problem we were trying to fix...  I saw your invitation but it gives me a Forbidden error when I try to open it 
2018-04-09 18:37:03	gjabell	ok so that was just a test 
2018-04-09 18:37:11	gjabell	now we need to add the matrix server 
2018-04-09 18:37:32	gjabell	although now that I think about it you are running it directly on http://jessesimpsoncodes.com (jessesimpsoncodes.com) right? 
2018-04-09 18:37:39	gjabell	not with a subdomain or anything 
2018-04-09 18:37:48	gjabell	cause I don't know how well it will work without a subdomain 
2018-04-09 18:38:31	gjabell	also if you are running caddy as a proxy you should probably make it a service 
2018-04-09 18:38:39	gjabell	so if you restart the pi it comes back up properly 
2018-04-09 18:38:53	jesse	its on a different port. 
2018-04-09 18:39:33	gjabell	yeah but the problem is you have no way of knowing if a request going to http://jessesimpsoncodes.com (jessesimpsoncodes.com) is going to your website or the matrix server 
2018-04-09 18:39:45	gjabell	I think we might be able to fix it easily tho 
2018-04-09 18:40:15	jesse	idk how to set http://jessesimpsoncodes.com (jessesimpsoncodes.com) to point to 8008 
2018-04-09 18:40:28	gjabell	I can help 
2018-04-09 18:40:36	gjabell	are your matrix configs in /etc/matrix-synapse? 
2018-04-09 18:41:11	jesse	i think its in .synapse 
2018-04-09 18:41:13	gjabell	ok 
2018-04-09 18:41:16	gjabell	go into that 
2018-04-09 18:41:25	gjabell	is there a conf.d folder? 
2018-04-09 18:41:44	jesse	nop 
2018-04-09 18:41:51	gjabell	what about homeserver.yaml 
2018-04-09 18:41:59	gjabell	or anything called server-name.yaml 
2018-04-09 18:43:04	jesse	yea that works 
2018-04-09 18:43:13	gjabell	which one lol 
2018-04-09 18:43:30	jesse	homeserver.yaml 
2018-04-09 18:43:41	gjabell	open that and see if there's a server_name anywhere 
2018-04-09 18:43:58	jesse	btw, I can let you ssh into my pi... and we can tmux to the same environment lol 
2018-04-09 18:44:08	gjabell	if you want xD 
2018-04-09 18:44:16	gjabell	didn't know you could share tmux that's neat 
2018-04-09 18:44:18	gjabell	makes sense tho 
2018-04-09 18:44:42	jesse	gimme an ssh key :P 
2018-04-09 18:45:04	gjabell	@gjabell uploaded a file: https://sturgill-operators.slack.com/files/U5AUU7HHA/FA39YT84R/id_rsa.pub (id rsa) 
2018-04-09 18:46:09	jesse	idk how to update the change but i updated the file of authorized keys 
2018-04-09 18:46:27	gjabell	shouldn't need an update I don't think 
2018-04-09 18:46:32	gjabell	what's the user? 
2018-04-09 18:47:00	jesse	pi 
2018-04-09 18:47:22	jesse	just run 'tmux a' when ya get in 
2018-04-09 18:47:24	gjabell	kk 
2018-04-09 18:47:46	gjabell	can I ssh through the domain? 
2018-04-09 18:47:49	gjabell	or do I need the ip 
2018-04-09 18:48:31	jesse	ssh pi@152.7.72.93 
2018-04-09 18:48:42	jesse	idk if you can use the domain lol 
2018-04-09 18:48:53	gjabell	doesn't look like it rip 
2018-04-09 18:48:55	gjabell	ip works tho 
2018-04-09 18:50:52	gjabell	how do you restart synapse 
2018-04-09 19:45:41	jesse	@jesse uploaded a file: https://sturgill-operators.slack.com/files/U3VPX29FW/FA365CK0Q/scrot.png (scrot) 
2018-05-01 21:03:40		getting channel history...
2018-04-09 17:14:49	gjabell	which is good bc you don't want josh tracking your location :P 
2018-04-09 17:15:59	jesse	xD. If I went to a plain-text website with no form of input, would someone be able to track my location if I was just using http? 
2018-04-09 17:16:25	gjabell	eh, maybe not 
2018-04-09 17:16:43	gjabell	but they'd see any communication between you and that website 
2018-04-09 17:16:58	gjabell	so if for some reason you were sending cookies, etc. it would be plaintext 
2018-04-09 17:19:29	gjabell	so quick question, when you set up matrix, did you set up federation? 
2018-04-09 17:21:04	jesse	I used synapse or synaptic or something. 
2018-04-09 17:21:22	gjabell	Yeah, matrix synapse is the server 
2018-04-09 17:21:44	gjabell	Did you need to run anything on port 8448 when you set it up? 
2018-04-09 17:23:51	jesse	I know something is running on port 8448, but I don't remember setting it up 
2018-04-09 17:24:00	gjabell	hmm ok 
2018-04-09 17:24:17	gjabell	bc if everything's setup correctly I should be able to message you from my server 
2018-04-09 17:24:35	gjabell	altho I think your server might be down now that I look at it 
2018-04-09 17:24:57	gjabell	at least the matrix server, looks like your website is still up 
2018-04-09 17:25:25	jesse	you are correct. I'm gonna demand my money back from amazon 
2018-04-09 17:25:30	gjabell	x 
2018-04-09 17:25:31	gjabell	xd 
2018-04-09 17:25:36	jesse	idk why it's down lol 
2018-04-09 17:25:39	gjabell	rip 
2018-04-09 17:25:43	gjabell	check the service 
2018-04-09 17:26:08	jesse	is it bad I don't remember the service name? 
2018-04-09 17:26:16	gjabell	lol xD 
2018-04-09 17:26:21	gjabell	might be matrix-synapse 
2018-04-09 17:29:03	jesse	that was wrong, but I got it up 
2018-04-09 17:29:33	gjabell	rip, what was it 
2018-04-09 17:30:05	jesse	source .synapse/bin/activate ;  synctl start 
2018-04-09 17:30:25	gjabell	oh, you installed it through souce 
2018-04-09 17:30:26	gjabell	source* 
2018-04-09 17:30:47	gjabell	if you restarted the pi it probably didn't restart matrix as well 
2018-04-09 17:31:43	gjabell	unf I still don't seem to be able to DM you from my server 
2018-04-09 17:31:48	gjabell	altho my client can connect now 
2018-04-09 17:32:00	gjabell	I wonder if it doesn't like it not being secure or something 
2018-04-09 17:32:10	jesse	yeah. I've restarted the pi a few times. have you created a user? 
2018-04-09 17:32:19	gjabell	on mine, yes 
2018-04-09 17:32:29	gjabell	I can connect to mine fine 
2018-04-09 17:32:41	gjabell	I should be able to send you messages from mine afaik but it doesn't recognize it 
2018-04-09 17:33:02	jesse	what's your username and domain/ 
2018-04-09 17:33:03	jesse	? 
2018-04-09 17:33:12	gjabell	@gjabell: 
2018-04-09 17:33:17	gjabell	fak 
2018-04-09 17:33:23	gjabell	'@gjabell:http://galenabell.com (galenabell.com)' 
2018-04-09 17:33:28	gjabell	without the quoates 
2018-04-09 17:34:52	jesse	you're giving me internal server errors lol 
2018-04-09 17:36:36	gjabell	rip 
2018-04-09 17:37:06	gjabell	can you SS the riot page 
2018-04-09 17:39:01	jesse	riot page? 
2018-04-09 17:39:20	gjabell	how are you trying to connect 
2018-04-09 17:39:47	jesse	oh I've been using the web interface. I can use riot though if ya want 
2018-04-09 17:40:33	gjabell	which web interface 
2018-04-09 17:40:51	gjabell	not sure if it matters, works for me on riot but any of them should work if it's set up right 
2018-04-09 17:41:32	jesse	the one on port :8008 on my IP... I should be able to connect to yours through my ip. 
2018-04-09 17:42:10	gjabell	wait, it has a web interface? 
2018-04-09 17:42:55	jesse	yea.  
2018-04-09 17:43:03	gjabell	lol rip I didn't even realize 
2018-04-09 17:43:05	jesse	that's how I messaged you the first time 
2018-04-09 17:43:06	gjabell	I've just been using http://riot.im (riot.im) 
2018-04-09 17:43:08	gjabell	oh 
2018-04-09 17:46:45	gjabell	if you log into your server, can you send me a message on mine? 
2018-04-09 17:47:17	jesse	i think i should be able to 
2018-04-09 17:47:23	gjabell	does it work tho 
2018-04-09 17:47:28	gjabell	that's the real question xD 
2018-04-09 17:48:49	jesse	nope 
2018-04-09 17:48:54	gjabell	rip 
2018-04-09 17:49:14	gjabell	I wonder if I configured it wrong... 
2018-04-09 17:49:19	gjabell	cause I feel like it should be working 
2018-04-09 17:50:18	gjabell	wait did you try https 
2018-04-09 17:50:44	gjabell	oohhh wait a min 
2018-04-09 17:50:50	jesse	nope I did not try https 
2018-04-09 17:50:51	gjabell	did you add srv dns records to yours 
2018-04-09 17:51:29	jesse	I don't think so? 
2018-04-09 17:51:38	gjabell	ok, that's probably why I can't see yours 
2018-04-09 17:51:49	gjabell	bc if I run mine through their checker it shows up as being valid 
2018-04-09 17:52:04	gjabell	apparently you have to add a _srv dns record to your dns to get everything to work 
2018-04-09 17:52:12	gjabell	not honestly sure what it's for but hey 
2018-04-09 17:52:19	jesse	how do i do that? 
2018-04-09 17:52:23	gjabell	so if you go to cloudflare, and go to your dns page 
2018-04-09 17:52:30	gjabell	at the top change it from A to srv 
2018-04-09 17:53:02	gjabell	in the thing that pops up, change your service name to _matrix and your name to your domainname 
2018-04-09 17:53:45	gjabell	then in the next prompt put 10 0 and 8448 for the priority, weight, and port 
2018-04-09 17:53:52	gjabell	then save and add record 
2018-04-09 17:54:03	jesse	done 
2018-04-09 17:54:41	gjabell	well your invitations show up now :D 
2018-04-09 17:54:45	gjabell	unf they are forbidden lol 
2018-04-09 17:55:48	jesse	what? lol 
2018-04-09 17:55:58	jesse	maybe I gotta do the cert thing 
2018-04-09 17:56:00	gjabell	idk it won't let me accept them 
2018-04-09 17:56:05	gjabell	just says 'Forbidden' 
2018-04-09 17:56:08	gjabell	probably a good idea yea 
2018-04-09 17:57:22	gjabell	when you set up the matrix server what did you use for the hostname 
2018-04-09 17:58:27	jesse	http://jessesimpsoncodes.com (jessesimpsoncodes.com) i think. 
2018-04-09 17:58:35	gjabell	ok 
2018-04-09 17:58:36	jesse	or maybe it just didn't ask me 
2018-04-09 17:59:13	gjabell	weird, so your server shows up as being valid now 
2018-04-09 17:59:18	gjabell	so it should be working I would think 
2018-04-09 18:00:40	jesse	really? cuz I just shut stuff down 
2018-04-09 18:00:52	gjabell	well that would explain why I can't find the server now lol xD 
2018-04-09 18:01:00	gjabell	it probably checked it before you shut it down 
2018-04-09 18:01:53	gjabell	when it's up again try sending me a DM invite 
2018-04-09 18:02:56	jesse	its up but I couldn't run acme cuz there was other things running. I don't even remember what was on port 80 so I wouldn't know what to shut down. 
2018-04-09 18:03:07	gjabell	probably apache 
2018-04-09 18:03:10	gjabell	running your website 
2018-04-09 18:07:12	jesse	man acme is a huge pain 
2018-04-09 18:07:21	gjabell	are you running acme.sh? 
2018-04-09 18:07:30	gjabell	cause I didn't have any issues with it on my end 
2018-04-09 18:07:41	gjabell	although I was just grabbing certs, not configuring apache with it 
2018-04-09 18:10:20	gjabell	you could also try using caddy, it's free and super easy to setup 
2018-04-09 18:10:32	gjabell	and it'll do the https stuff for you so you don't have to use acme 
2018-04-09 18:11:05	jesse	yeah. acme is just complaining. first it wanted me to shut down the website and then it complained about it not being up. but anyway, I just got acme to renew the cert... although it said the one I had was already valid anyway 
2018-04-09 18:11:16	gjabell	lol 
2018-04-09 18:11:24	gjabell	yeah it's fine for 2 months or something like that 
2018-04-09 18:11:33	gjabell	do you want to try caddy? 
2018-04-09 18:11:43	jesse	sure 
2018-04-09 18:11:46	gjabell	ok 
2018-04-09 18:12:38	gjabell	you're going to run this: curl https://getcaddy.com | bash -s personal 
2018-04-09 18:12:40	gjabell	to install it 
2018-04-09 18:12:46	jesse	do I need to remove apache2?? 
2018-04-09 18:12:52	gjabell	probably a good idea yea 
2018-04-09 18:13:50	jesse	what is personal? 
2018-04-09 18:13:55	gjabell	personal license 
2018-04-09 18:14:06	gjabell	they have a business license too but you have to pay for it 
2018-04-09 18:19:17	jesse	it doesn't seem to be making a difference 
2018-04-09 18:19:28	gjabell	have you actually set up caddy? 
2018-04-09 18:19:38	gjabell	bc installing it doesn't actually get it all working 
2018-04-09 18:19:39	jesse	yeah, and ran it 
2018-04-09 18:20:31	gjabell	what's your caddyfile 
2018-04-09 18:21:46	jesse	didn't make one 
2018-04-09 18:21:59	gjabell	ok so try this 
2018-04-09 18:22:07	gjabell	mkdir /etc/caddy 
2018-04-09 18:22:38	gjabell	mkdir -p /var/www/ 
2018-04-09 18:22:53	gjabell	make an index.html file in /var/www/ and put some random shit in it 
2018-04-09 18:23:01	gjabell	vim /etc/caddy/Caddyfile 
2018-04-09 18:23:26	gjabell	in the caddyfile put http://jessesimpsoncodes.com (jessesimpsoncodes.com) { 
2018-04-09 18:23:31	gjabell	root /var/www 
2018-04-09 18:23:33	gjabell	gzip 
2018-04-09 18:23:40	gjabell	tls [your email] 
2018-04-09 18:23:40	gjabell	} 
2018-04-09 18:24:09	gjabell	then try running caddy -conf=/etc/caddy/Caddyfile 
2018-04-09 18:24:23	gjabell	and see if you can hit your server ip in a web browser to bring up the page 
2018-04-09 18:27:31	jesse	i got a no such file or directory error 
2018-04-09 18:27:51	gjabell	any output from the console? 
2018-04-09 18:28:23	jesse	Activating privacy features... 2018/04/09 22:28:01 open /home/pi/.caddy/acme/acme-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/sites/(http://jessesimpsoncodes.com (jessesimpsoncodes.com))/(http://jessesimpsoncodes.com (jessesimpsoncodes.com)).crt: no such file or directory 
2018-04-09 18:29:20	gjabell	can you ss your caddyfile? 
2018-04-09 18:30:26	jesse	@jesse uploaded a file: https://sturgill-operators.slack.com/files/U3VPX29FW/FA3RVVADQ/scrot.png (scrot) 
2018-04-09 18:30:55	gjabell	change the url line to just 'http://jessesimpsoncodes.com (jessesimpsoncodes.com)' (without quotes) 
2018-04-09 18:31:00	gjabell	just domain, no http, nothing 
2018-04-09 18:32:49	jesse	thats the same line... with the exception of the curly bracket 
2018-04-09 18:33:38	gjabell	I think slack is doing weird stuff with the urls I am sending you 
2018-04-09 18:33:40	gjabell	1s 
2018-04-09 18:34:28	gjabell	@gjabell uploaded a file: https://sturgill-operators.slack.com/files/U5AUU7HHA/FA4TCKS2K/2018-04-09-183410_288x79_scrot.png (2018-04-09-183410 288x79 scrot) 
2018-04-09 18:34:29	jesse	jessesimpsoncodes (jessesimpsoncodes) with the DOTcoms 
2018-04-09 18:34:48	gjabell	got a bit cutoff whoops 
2018-04-09 18:34:55	gjabell	that's what it should look like 
2018-04-09 18:34:56	jesse	gotcha 
2018-04-09 18:35:13	gjabell	if you just put the url it will redirect http to https and get a cert for htttps 
2018-04-09 18:35:16	gjabell	https* 
2018-04-09 18:36:49	jesse	it seemed to work now... but I forgot what problem we were trying to fix...  I saw your invitation but it gives me a Forbidden error when I try to open it 
2018-04-09 18:37:03	gjabell	ok so that was just a test 
2018-04-09 18:37:11	gjabell	now we need to add the matrix server 
2018-04-09 18:37:32	gjabell	although now that I think about it you are running it directly on http://jessesimpsoncodes.com (jessesimpsoncodes.com) right? 
2018-04-09 18:37:39	gjabell	not with a subdomain or anything 
2018-04-09 18:37:48	gjabell	cause I don't know how well it will work without a subdomain 
2018-04-09 18:38:31	gjabell	also if you are running caddy as a proxy you should probably make it a service 
2018-04-09 18:38:39	gjabell	so if you restart the pi it comes back up properly 
2018-04-09 18:38:53	jesse	its on a different port. 
2018-04-09 18:39:33	gjabell	yeah but the problem is you have no way of knowing if a request going to http://jessesimpsoncodes.com (jessesimpsoncodes.com) is going to your website or the matrix server 
2018-04-09 18:39:45	gjabell	I think we might be able to fix it easily tho 
2018-04-09 18:40:15	jesse	idk how to set http://jessesimpsoncodes.com (jessesimpsoncodes.com) to point to 8008 
2018-04-09 18:40:28	gjabell	I can help 
2018-04-09 18:40:36	gjabell	are your matrix configs in /etc/matrix-synapse? 
2018-04-09 18:41:11	jesse	i think its in .synapse 
2018-04-09 18:41:13	gjabell	ok 
2018-04-09 18:41:16	gjabell	go into that 
2018-04-09 18:41:25	gjabell	is there a conf.d folder? 
2018-04-09 18:41:44	jesse	nop 
2018-04-09 18:41:51	gjabell	what about homeserver.yaml 
2018-04-09 18:41:59	gjabell	or anything called server-name.yaml 
2018-04-09 18:43:04	jesse	yea that works 
2018-04-09 18:43:13	gjabell	which one lol 
2018-04-09 18:43:30	jesse	homeserver.yaml

2017-08-11 11:12:19	jesse	Hey Nicole, I recall you mentioning that you took MEA 130 - Intro to Weather
2017-08-11 11:12:19		did you buy the textbook for that class? 
2017-08-11 11:15:05	nmcroutw	Yes I did 
2017-08-15 12:42:52	jesse	do you think it was useful or necessary for the class? 
2017-08-15 12:51:47	nmcroutw	Yeah I used it to study for the tests a lot  
2017-08-15 17:47:01	jesse	alright thanks! 
2017-09-12 11:37:14	nmcroutw	Are we presenting something in class today? 
2017-09-12 14:38:24	jesse	yes :stuck_out_tongue: 
2017-09-12 14:38:53	jesse	sorry i didn't see your message 
2017-09-21 10:43:16	nmcroutw	Hey what does your truth table for 495 look like? 
2017-09-21 10:46:23	jesse	@jesse uploaded a file: https://sturgill-operators.slack.com/files/U3VPX29FW/F766Q1A7K/2017-09-21-104547_840x511_scrot.png (2017-09-21-104547_840x511_scrot.png) 
2017-09-21 10:46:36	jesse	this is for health insurance selector 
2017-09-21 10:51:11	nmcroutw	Okay so then you are just going to rank the factors in the first column 1 - 15 or whatever 
2017-09-21 10:52:00	jesse	yup 
2017-09-21 10:52:41	jesse	i expected it to be more thorough, but my teammates didn't contribute 
2017-09-21 10:52:57	nmcroutw	Alright. and yeah I'm having that same issue 
2017-09-21 10:53:22	nmcroutw	So the plans are combinations of the top attributes 
2017-09-21 10:53:25	nmcroutw	? 
2017-09-21 10:54:05	jesse	different health plans 
2017-09-21 10:54:38	jesse	with different combinations of the attributes shown on the left side 
2017-09-21 10:56:15	nmcroutw	Okay so my topic is farmer crop selector so instead of plan would I have crop1, crop 2 and then my attributes are like climate, soil type, etc or should I be more specific with my attributes like warm/humid climate, cold/dry climate, clay soil, etc 
2017-09-21 10:57:00	nmcroutw	ANd do you actually need to fill in the table? 
2017-09-21 11:02:10	jesse	I' would recommend being more specific if you can. but I don't think you need to fill in the table. 
2017-09-21 11:04:50	jesse	btw, if I were to ask the teacher if me, matt, and thomas could break away from our groups to make a new one, would you join us? honestly, I don't think dr. koala would let us do this, but i might ask anyway just in case. 
2017-09-21 11:05:39	nmcroutw	I would however my group only has 4 people in it including me so I doubt I could leave mine. 
2017-09-21 11:05:52	nmcroutw	And thanks so much for your help. This class is so confusing 
2017-09-21 11:07:42	jesse	any time. and yeah it is.
